Multicompartmental analysis of [11C]-carfentanil binding to opiate receptors in humans measured by positron emission tomography,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,"Frost, J J,Douglass, K H,Mayberg, H S,Dannals, R F,Links, J M,Wilson, A A,Ravert, H T,Crozier, W C,Wagner, H N Jr,eng,NS 150-80/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. 1989 Jun;9(3):398-409. doi: 10.1038/jcbfm.1989.59.","[11C]-Carfentanil is a high affinity opiate agonist that can be used to localize mu opiate receptors in humans by positron emission tomography (PET). A four-compartment model was used to obtain quantitative estimates of rate constants for receptor association and dissociation. PET studies were performed in five normal subjects in the absence and presence of 1 mg/kg naloxone. Arterial plasma concentration of [11C]-carfentanil and its labeled metabolites were determined during each PET study. The value of k3/k4 = Bmax/kD was determined for each subject in the presence and absence of naloxone. There was a significant reduction in the value of k3/k4 from 3.4 +/- 0.92 to 0.26 +/- 0.13 in the thalamus (p less than 0.01) and from 1.8 +/- 0.33 to 0.16 +/- 0.065 in the frontal cortex (p less than 0.001). Mean values of frontal cortex/occipital cortex and thalamus/occipital cortex ratios were determined for the interval 35-70 min after injection when receptor binding is high relative to nonspecific binding. The relationship between the measured region/occipital cortex values and the corresponding values of k3/k4 in the presence and absence of naloxone was: regions/occipital cortex = 0.95 + 0.74 (k3/k4) with r = 0.98 (n = 20). Simulation studies also demonstrated a linear relationship between the thalamus/occipital cortex or frontal cortex/occipital cortex ratio and k3/k4 for less than twofold increases or decreases in k3/k4. Simulation studies in which thalamic blood flow was varied demonstrated no significant effect on the region/occipital cortex ratio at 35-70 min for a twofold increase or fourfold decrease in blood flow. Therefore, the region/occipital cortex ratio can be used to quantitate changes in k3/k4 when tracer kinetic modeling is not feasible.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2541148,N,no phys of interest,,,

Using these two tracers, the integrity of the presynaptic striatal dopaminergic system has been studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) who had an akinetic-rigid syndrome that was poorly responsive to L-dopa, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia. PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Influx constants, Ki, reflecting specific 18F-dopa uptake into striatal tissue, were severely reduced in the putamen and caudate of the 10 MSA subjects (mean putamen Ki 0.005 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls; mean caudate Ki 0.007 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls). Reduction of putamen, but not caudate, 18F-dopa uptake correlated with severity and duration of locomotor disability. Eight patients with PD, and a similar degree and duration of locomotor disability to the patients with MSA, demonstrated equal impairment of mean putamen 18F-dopa uptake, but significant preservation of mean caudate function. The 7 PAF patients had normal mean levels of putamen and caudate 18F-dopa uptake, although 1 individual PAF patient had significantly impaired striatal function. The MSA and PD groups of subjects both showed significantly reduced levels of specific striatal S-11C-NMF binding, again caudate function being relatively preserved in PD. It is concluded that in both MSA and PD there is a parallel decline of striatal dopamine storage capacity and reuptake site integrity, probably reflecting a loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals. Caudate function is relatively preserved in PD compared with MSA. The majority of PAF patients have an intact nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, suggesting that PAF is a condition distinct from PD and MSA in spite of some pathological similarities. PET is capable of detecting subclinical nigrostriatal involvement in PAF patients when this is present.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2123119,N,no HC,,,

We also studied eight lacunar stroke patients so as to disclose the influences of vascular risk factors and aging on the cerebral blood flow and metabolism. We can conclude from our result as follows: 1. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) was minimum in the basal ganglia and cerebral blood flow (CBF)/CBV ratio was higher than that of cerebral cortex in healthy volunteers; 2. CBF of gray matter in healthy volunteers correlated with CBV and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen where oxygen extraction fraction inversely correlated with CBF, CBV, and CBF/CBV; and 3. the basal ganglia CBF/CBV ratio in lacunar stroke patients was lower than that of healthy volunteers.

The severity of cerebral white matter changes was estimated by T1 value images on MRI and was measured in the bilateral frontal lobe on an axial slice at the level of the basal ganglia and in the bilateral anterior, middle, and posterior portions on axial slices at the level of the body of the lateral ventricle. Mental function was measured by the Hasegawa's dementia rating scale (HDS) and Kohs' block design test (Kohs' test). The severity of cerebral frontal white matter changes increased significantly with age (p less than 0.05). However there was no significant correlation between the severity of cerebral white matter changes and HDS, Kohs' test. The severity of frontal white matter changes correlated with the mean arterial blood pressure (p less than 0.02).

We have used PET and tracer doses of [11C]cocaine in 7 normal human volunteers to assess if the distribution and clearance of cocaine are altered by alcohol intoxication. Each subject received 2 PET studies with [11C]cocaine (3-11 micrograms), one before and one during alcohol intoxication (1 g/kg). Regions of interest included the brain (n = 3) and heart (n = 4). Arterial plasma was assayed for unchanged cocaine and for labeled cocaethylene, a metabolite of cocaine found in individuals using cocaine and alcohol in combination (Hearn et al., 1991a). Alcohol intoxication did not change uptake and clearance or the steady-state distribution volume of [11C] cocaine in brain (striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum) or in heart. Moreover, labeled cocaethylene was not detected in the 10 minute plasma sample. These results suggest that the acute enhancement of behavior and toxicity associated with the combined use of cocaine and alcohol is not due to an alteration in cocaine's organ distribution or to cocaethylene formation but may be related to an additive effect resulting from the direct actions of each of these drugs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1481142,N,clinical,,,

In studies with a baboon (Papio anubis), [11C]WIN 35,428 accumulated in brain regions containing dopamine transporters, i.e., the striata. This accumulation was partially blocked by prior administration of (-)cocaine (4 mg/kg, i.v.). Placement of a unilateral lesion of dopamine-containing nerve terminals with MPTP resulted in a unilateral reduction in [11C]WIN 35,428 accumulation in the striatum on the side of the lesion. Imaging of D2 dopamine receptors with [11C]NMSP in the same MPTP-treated animals showed much less reduction in the postsynaptic D2 dopamine receptors as compared to the much larger reduction in the dopamine transporters labeled with [11C]WIN 35,428. A total of ten normal human volunteers (five males and five females) with ages ranging from 19 to 81 years were studied. The caudate/cerebellar and putamen/cerebellar ratios ranged from 4.4 to 5.7 90 min after injection of the tracer. Preliminary kinetic modeling with arterial plasma sampling resulted in an average binding potential (k3/k4) of 4.98 in the caudate nucleus and 5.13 in putamen. To demonstrate in vivo blockade with dopamine reuptake inhibitors, two subjects received prior oral doses of 6 mg mazindol.

Yet, many of these areas are also implicated in the processing of nonpainful somatosensory information. In order to better characterize the processing of pain within the human brain, activation produced by noxious stimuli was compared with that produced by robust innocuous stimuli. Painful heat (47-48 degrees C), nonpainful vibratory (110 Hz), and neutral control (34 degrees C) stimuli were applied to the left forearm of right-handed male subjects. Activation of regions within the diencephalon and telencephalon was evaluated by measuring regional cerebral blood flow using positron emission tomography (15O-water-bolus method). Painful stimulation produced contralateral activation in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, the supplemental motor area of the frontal cortex, and thalamus. Vibrotactile stimulation produced activation in contralateral SI, and bilaterally in SII and posterior insular cortices. A direct comparison of pain and vibrotactile stimulation revealed that both stimuli produced activation in similar regions of SI and SII, regions long thought to be involved in basic somatosensory processing. In contrast, painful stimuli were significantly more effective in activating the anterior insula, a region heavily linked with both somatosensory and limbic systems. Such connections may provide one route through which nociceptive input may be integrated with memory in order to allow a full appreciation of the meaning and dangers of painful stimuli. These data reveal that pain-related activation, although predominantly contralateral in distribution, is more widely dispersed across both cortical and thalamic regions than that produced during innocuous vibrotactile stimulation. This distributed cerebral activation reflects the complex nature of pain, involving discriminative, affective, autonomic, and motoric components. Furthermore, the high degree of interconnectivity among activated regions may account for the difficulty of eliminating pathological pain with discrete CNS lesions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8027764,N,no phys of interest,,,

The results suggest that volitionally induced increases in inspiratory muscle force are achieved via a complex integration of neuronal activations in cortical and subcortical regions associated with motor control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8889766,N,no corr,,,
Traumatic nociceptive pain activates the hypothalamus and the periaqueductal gray: a positron emission tomography study,Pain,"Hsieh, J C,Stahle-Backdahl, M,Hagermark, O,Stone-Elander, S,Rosenquist, G,Ingvar, M,eng,Clinical Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Pain. 1996 Feb;64(2):303-14. doi: 10.1016/0304-3959(95)00129-8.","The study was conducted to investigate which areas of the brain respond to a painful encounter of minor dermal injury (a model of clinical pain) elicited by intracutaneous injection of a minute amount of ethanol. Four healthy volunteers (27-46 years) were subjected to positron emission tomographic (PET) investigation of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using [15O]butanol as tracer. The ethanol (20 microliters, 70%) and saline (20 microliters, 0.9%) were injected intracutaneously 3 times in a single-blinded, semi-randomised manner for the pain experiment. All the injections were performed, adjacent to each other, at the lateral aspect of the right upper arm. Subjective sensory intensity of pain, unpleasantness and anxiety were rated with separate 100-mm visual analogue scales together with the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al. 1970) and heart rate. Paired-subtraction (pixel-by-pixel) between ethanol and saline was performed. Traumatic pain significantly caused higher ratings of intensity and affect scales, i.e., pain intensity, unpleasantness and increased sympathetic activity (evidenced by tachycardia). In contrast the anxiety rating remained unchanged. Acute traumatic nociceptive pain prominently activated the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray (PAG). In addition, activations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), insular, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), primary motor/somatosensory areas (MI/SI: face, upper arm), supplementary motor area (SMA), and cerebellum were also demonstrated. The central processing of the pain-relevant/anticipatory arousal also engaged the PAG. This study demonstrates the involvement of the human cerebral cortex in perception, arousal, cognitive evaluative processes, and, hence, affective reactions (somatic/ autonomic outflow) associated with pain. The pain stimulus of traumatic character may, by its very nature, evoke the central processing to involve both the hypothalamus and the PAG.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8740608,N,no corr,,,

Hypoperfusion may reflect some interictal pathophysiology characteristic of epilepsy, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. In order to elucidate the controlling system of rCBF in patients with CPS (complex partial seizure), we measured by positron emission tomography rCBF and CO2 vasoreactivity performing a hyperventilatory task, and made comparisons between the affected and contralateral sides of the temporal lobes in CPS patients and the temporal lobe of normal volunteers. We also measured PaCO2, pH, PaO2 and respiratory rate at rest to elucidate the CBF maintaining system. SUBJECTS: 15 volunteers and 12 medically controlled patients with CPS were examined. The affected side of the brain of the patients was determined by dominance of EEG paroxysm. METHOD: For measuring rCBF, the Shimadzu HEADTOME-IV system (8mm FWHM) and H2(15)O (740-1480 [MBq]/scan) bolus injection method were employed. First a rest scan, then a hyperventilatory task scan was performed, at 20 min. intervals between each scan. During the rest scans, the subjects were required to close their eyes, which were covered through the transmission scan and all the other scans. They were monitered with EEG to insure that they were not asleep. Room lights were dimmed, room sounds were kept to a minimum and noises were damped with earplugs. During the hyperventilatory tasks, the subjects were asked to inspire deeply at a rate of 15/min. for 4.5 min. from 3 min. before the scan up to the end of the 1.5 min. scan, and monitored with a respiratory band around the abdomen. Arterial blood gas pressures (PaCO2, pH and PaO2) were also measured with a blood gas analyzer (Radio Meter ABL 330) at the beginning and at the end of the scans. [HCO3-] was calculated on the formula of Henderson-Hasselbalch. Vascular response to PaCO2 change: VrCO2 was defined as follows: VrCO2 = 100 x (CBFh-CBFr)/CBFr/(PaCO2h-PaCO2r) the subscripts h: hyperventilatory r: resting conditions. RESULTS: Blood gasses, rCBF and corrected-rCBF at rest: In the patients, PaCO2 (mmHg) = 46.11 +/- 2.32, pH = 7.374 +/- 0.020, [HCO3-] (mEq/ml) = 25.98 +/- 1.15, CBF (ml/100g/min) = 45.51 +/- 9.33, corrected-CBF (ml/100g/min) = 40.06 +/- 7.27. In the volunteers, PaCO2 = 40. 67 +/- 2.37, pH = 7.400 +/- 0.021, [HCO3-] = 24.36 +/- 1.66, CBF = 48.76 +/- 8.54, corrected-CBF = 48.02 +/- 9.04. PaCO2 and [HCO3-] in the patients were significantly higher than those in the volunteers. pH and corrected-CBF were significantly lower than those in the volunteers. CBF showed no difference. VrCO2 in the temporal lobe: In the affected side of the patients, VrCO2 = 1.976 +/- 0.54. In the contralateral side of the patients, VrCO2 = 2.145 +/- 0.667. In the temporal lobe of the volunteers, VrCO2 = 2.557 +/- 0.898. In both sides of the temporal lobe of the patients, VrCO2 was significantly lower than those in the volunteers. COMMENTS: The effect of anticonvulsant drugs and the suppressive mechanism around the foci are supposed to reduce CBF of CPS patients. We suppose another mechanism, which is vasoconstriction. A significant difference was noted in CO2-vasoreactivity in the temporal lobe between patients and volunteers. Also no difference was noted in rCBF in the temporal lobe between the volunteers and the patients, when the arteries were maximally constricted with the HIV-task. These two results suggest that vasoconstrictive mechanism may be among the factors for the hypoperfusion seen in the temporal lobe of the patients. In patients, PaCO2, [H+], [HCO3-] were significantly higher compared with the volunteers, which suggests the mechanism of respiratory acidosis. Owing to this hypercapnia, global CBF in the patients is maintained in compensation for the hyperfusion and vasoconstriction seen around the foci. CO2 acts as an anticonvulsant and also reduces glucose metabolites which accumulate around the foci.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8935829,N,no corr,,,

To establish the validity of the latter possibility, we have performed a number of experiments. We measured the regional selectivity of two different dopaminergic ligands: the dopamine release compound D-amphetamine and the dopamine transporter antagonist 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluoropheny) tropane (CFT). Both compounds led to increased signal intensity in gradient echo images in regions of the brain with high dopamine receptor density (frontal cortex, striatum, cingulate cortex > > parietal cortex). Lesioning the animals with unilaterally administered 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) led to ablation of the phMRI response on the ipsilateral side; control measurements of rCBV and rCBF using bolus injections of Gd-DTPA showed that the baseline rCBV and rCBF values were intact on the lesioned side. The time course of the BOLD signal changes paralleled the changes observed by microdialysis measurements of dopamine release in the striatum for both amphetamine and CFT; peaking at 20-40 min after injection and returning to baseline at about 70-90 min. Signal changes were not correlated with either heart rate, blood pressure or pCO2. Measurement of PET binding in the same animals showed an excellent correlation with the phMRI data when compared by either measurements of the number of pixels activated or percent signal change in a given region. The time course for the behavioral measurements of rotation in the 6-OHDA lesioned animals correlated with the phMRI. These experiments demonstrate that phMRI will become a valuable, noninvasive tool for investigation of neurotransmitter activity in vivo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9339439,N,methods study,,,

These are induced emotions in normal subjects and the comparison of patients suffering from emotional disorders with normal control subjects. These traditional methods, which have limitations, may be complemented by a third approach: the experimental elicitation of affect through pharmacologic limbic stimulation with intravenous procaine hydrochloride. In this paper, the authors review their research using the direct stimulation approach. To determine whether procaine produces affectively laden experiences accompanied by a reliable change in brain activity, 10 normal subjects received two injections each of placebo (A) and procaine (B)-in ABBA order-while in a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. In a further study, emotional responses were observed among 24 subjects (including the 10 subjects in the PET study) for a total of 80 procaine injections. Procaine was shown to induce bilateral activation of an anterior limbic network concomitant with powerful, transient emotional and other subjective phenomena as well as autonomic and endocrine responses. Considerable between-subject variability in responses was noted, suggesting that this method can be used to explore individual differences in the neurobiological basis of emotion and affective disposition. Experimental elicitation of affect through limbic stimulation with procaine, when used as part of a triangulation strategy with traditional imaging paradigms, can contribute to our understanding of emotion and its disorders, of the different components of emotion-response systems (e.g., subjective, autonomic, and endocrine), and of individual differences in affective disposition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9430504,N,no paper,,,

The insular cortex has been implicated as a region of cortical cardiovascular control, yet its role during exercise remains undefined. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether the insular cortex was activated during volitional dynamic exercise and to evaluate further its role as a site for regulation of autonomic activity. 2. Eight subjects were studied during voluntary active cycling and passively induced cycling. Additionally, four of the subjects underwent passive movement combined with electrical stimulation of the legs. 3. Increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distribution were determined for each individual using single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) co-registered with magnetic resonance (MR) images to define exact anatomical sites of cerebral activation during each condition. 4. The rCBF significantly increased in the left insula during active, but not passive cycling. There were no significant changes in rCBF for the right insula. Also, the magnitude of rCBF increase for leg primary motor areas was significantly greater for both active cycling and passive cycling combined with electrical stimulation compared with passive cycling alone. 5. These findings provide the first evidence of insular activation during dynamic exercise in humans, suggesting that the left insular cortex may serve as a site for cortical regulation of cardiac autonomic (parasympathetic) activity.

Using the H215O intravenous bolus method with arterial blood sampling, global CBF changes were assessed quantitatively. Painful stimulation produced a 22.8% decrease in global CBF from resting levels (P < 0.0005). This decrease was not accounted for by arterial PCO2 or heart rate changes. Although the exact mechanism remains to be determined, this pain-induced global decrease represents a previously unidentified response of CBF.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9469155,N,no brain data,,,

H2 15 O positron emission tomography was used to measure rCBF, and the constant voltage technique was used to measure NSF from the left hand. Electrodermal activity was positively related to rCBF in the left primary motor cortex (MI, Brodmann's Area 4) and bilaterally in the anterior (Areas 24 and 32) and posterior cingulate cortex (Area 23). Negative relations were observed bilaterally in the secondary visual cortex (Areas 18 and 19) and the right inferior parietal cortex (Area 39), with a tendency also for the right insular cortex (Areas 13, 15, and 16). Because results from lesion and stimulation studies in humans converge with the present imaging results, we conclude that the cingulum and the motor cortex, in addition to the parietal and possibly the insular cortex, form part of one or several distributed neural network(s) involved in electrodermal control. Because these areas also support anticipation, affect, and locomotion, electrodermal responses seem to reflect cognitively or emotionally mediated motor preparation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9529944,Y,corr,uns,non-specific SCR,

The respective contributions of oculomotor and spatial transformation areas to this activation pattern were separated by means of a control condition involving the execution and suppression of eye movements. Areas activated in association with the control of eye movements included the superior parietal lobule and the frontal eye fields. The cooperation of different brain areas was analysed by correlating the time course of task-dependent BOLD signal changes in these areas. This correlation analysis revealed coactivation of occipitotemporal object recognition areas and a spatial transformation area in the intraparietal sulcus during the reading of transformed letter strings.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided some data for the auditory cortex in awake humans, but there is still a paucity of comparable data for subcortical auditory areas where the early stages of processing take place, as amply demonstrated by single-unit studies in animals. It is unclear why fMRI has been unsuccessful in imaging auditory brain-stem activity, but one problem may be cardiac-related, pulsatile brain-stem motion. To examine this, a method eliminating such motion (using cardiac gating) was applied to map sound-related activity in the auditory cortices and inferior colliculi in the brain stem. Activation in both the colliculi and cortex became more discernible when gating was used. In contrast with the cortex, the improvement in the colliculi resulted from a reduction in signal variability, rather than from an increase in percent signal change. This reduction is consistent with the hypothesis that motion or pulsatile flow is a major factor in brain-stem imaging.

The aim of the present study was to determine the brain sites mediating aspects of respiratory and cardiovascular control in adult humans using non-invasive functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) procedures, thereby avoiding the spatial and temporal sampling limitations associated with classic neural assessment techniques. 2. We examined activity changes across the entire brain following application of respiratory loads and upon induction of blood pressure and heart rate alterations. Magnetic resonance signals were visualized with a 1.5 Tesla scanner in healthy volunteers (22-52 years of age) using procedures that optimally assess changes in brain tissue microcirculation. Images were collected during a Valsalva manoeuvre, inspiratory loading, hypercapnia, cold pressor challenges to the hand and forehead and during intervening baseline states. 3. Image values from experimental conditions were compared with corresponding baseline values on a pixel-by-pixel basis to identify brain regions in which the experimental conditions produced physiological activation. 4. Ventilatory and pressor challenges elicited significant changes in regional image signal intensity in areas within the orbital cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus and hippocampus. Cerebellar, medullary and pontine areas were also recruited. However, while particular brain regions were only activated during specific stimuli, other regional signal changes occurred with multiple experimental manipulations. 5. The findings indicate that respiratory and cardiac challenges elicit discrete activity changes over multiple brain sites. Activated regions include structures not often related to respiratory or cardiovascular regulation, such as the cerebellum; a prominent role for limbic forebrain structures in mediating the response is also suggested. The fMRI visualization procedures may greatly assist in the determination of neural structures that mediate respiratory and cardiovascular control in humans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9673830,N,no coords,,,

The aim of the present study has been to determine empirically over a period of twelve months the costs of FDG PET, making use of a satellite concept. METHODS: Documentation on performance and consumption data has been assembled for purposes of cost analysis. After analysis these data provided the basis for an assessment of the costs. In view of the high proportion of fixed overheads and strong fluctuations in consumption values, it was not possible to allocate reliably in an individual FDG PET investigation the various types of costs to individual causes. A monthly cost assessment procedure was therefore adopted. For this purpose data were recorded in the department for Nuclear Medicine, while the statistical assessment of the consumption data and analysis of the costs were undertaken in the Institute of Industrial and Hospital Management.

The non volume based costs, maintenance charges and depreciation accounted for the highest proportion of the total costs (48%). The FDG-related costs accounted for 41% of the total costs, while the personnel costs amounted to 11% and the film costs to only 0.45%. The total costs incurred amounted to DM 1,205,050.

Although morphological characteristics of SBI have been well defined, their characteristic patterns of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism are in dispute. The purpose of this study was to elucidate CBF and metabolism in patients with SBI in relation to symptomatic stroke. METHODS: The patients underwent PET and were separated into three groups; control group (C group), with no lesions on CT (n=9, mean age 57), SBI group, with no neurological signs or history of stroke, but with ischaemic lesions on CT (n=9, mean age 63), and brain infarction group (BI group), with neurological deficits and compatible CT lesions in the area supplied by perforating arteries (n=19, mean age 56). Regional CBF, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured by PET. RESULTS: Mean values for CBF to the cerebral cortex and deep grey matter were lower in the SBI group (31.6 (SD 5.8) and 34.3 (SD 6.9) ml/100 g/min, respectively) and in the BI group (30.8 (SD 5.2), 33.9 (SD 5.9), respectively) than in the C group (36.0 (SD 6.6) and 43.5 (SD 9.5), respectively). Although mean CMRO2 of deep grey matter (2.36 (SD 0.52) ml/100 g/min) was significantly decreased in the SBI group compared with the C group (2.76 (SD 0.480), p<0.01), CMRO2 of the cortical area was as well preserved in the SBI patients (2.36 (SD 0.39)) as in the controls (2.48 (SD 0.32)) with a compensatory increase of mean OEF (0.45 (SD 0.06) and 0.41 (SD 0.05), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SBI showed decreased CBF and CMRO2 in deep grey matter. On the other hand, decreased CBF with milder increased OEF, resulting in preserved CMRO2 in the cerebral cortex indicates the presence of occult misery perfusion, suggesting that patients with SBI have reduced cerebral perfusional reserves.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9728942,N,case study,,,

The animals were anesthetized with halothane and immobilized by gallamine triethiodide. The gCBF as well as the rCBF were measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with a camera specifically designed for use in small animals. Slow intravenous bolus injections of 15O-labeled water were followed by 3-min acquisition of regional radioactivity starting at the time of injection. In all experiments the gCBF as well as the blood pressure were increased by noxious inward-outward rotations of the normal and of the inflamed joint, whereas the blood pressure and the rCBF remained unchanged during bolus injections under control conditions (without any joint movement). Movements of the inflamed joint evoked significantly greater increases in blood pressure and gCBF than corresponding ones of the normal joint. These increases in gCBF were paralleled by increases in rCBF along the complete anterior to posterior axis of the brain. Again, the increases in rCBF were larger, more extensive and more uniform following the stimulation of the inflamed joint relative to the results obtained with stimulation of the normal joint. No significant laterality was seen, but when an atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis was carried out and when the individual variations in rCBF were removed with two-way ANOVA, significant differences were disclosed in rCBF between the stimulated condition and the resting condition in a large number of brain regions. In particular, noxious rotation of the normal (right) elbow joint induced a significant increase in rCBF over the cerebral cortex and in the right thalamus and hippocampus. The same stimulation of the (left) inflamed joint induced a significant increase in rCBF throughout the brain; the biggest increase being over the right posterior cortex. It is concluded that under the conditions of the present experiments the generally accepted autoregulation of the cerebral blood flow is not fully functioning, and various factors that may be responsible for this failure (which obscures rCBF differences) are discussed. The more pronounced increases in rCBF when moving inflamed joints instead of normal ones is thought to be a direct consequence of the peripheral sensitization of the articular nociceptors and the consequent central hyperexcitability induced in the articular nociceptive pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9504839,N,cats,,,

Acoustic stimulation consists of 1000 Hz pulsed sine tones at a pulse rate of 6 Hz and a sound pressure level of 95 dB. For monaural stimulation, normal-hearing subjects revealed a strong lateralization of cortical response towards the contralateral hemisphere. The lateralization ratios between left and right hemispheric response areas were 3.4-5.2 for monaural stimulation and nearly balanced for binaural stimulation. Additionally, the sum of cortical activation volumes induced by monaural left and right stimulation was approximately 30% smaller than for binaural stimulation, indicating either inhibitory mechanisms or neuronal facilitation within the auditory pathways. For monaural deaf subjects the lateralization ratio between left to right response was just 1.3 towards the contralateral hemisphere of the healthy ear, which is comparable to binaural responses of normal-hearing subjects.

Purpose-built additional body shielding, made to conform to the shape of a volunteer, reduced the randoms count rate in a heart blood flow measurement (H[2]15O) by about 30%. After scatter correction the discrepancy between ROI count ratios for compartments within the 20 cm diameter 'Utah' phantom differed by less than 5% from true (sampled) activity concentration ratios. This was so with or without activity outside the FOV and with or without additional side shielding. Count rate performance is thus improved by extra shielding but more improvement is seen in head than in body scanning. Measurement of heart blood flow using bolus injections of H(2)15O would benefit from the use of detectors with lower deadtime and superior timing resolution such as LSO (lutetium oxyorthosilicate).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9572513,N,no phys of interest,,,

Pictures of human faces bearing fearful or happy expressions were presented to 10 normal, healthy subjects by using a backward masking procedure that resulted in 8 of 10 subjects reporting that they had not seen these facial expressions. The backward masking procedure consisted of 33 msec presentations of fearful or happy facial expressions, their offset coincident with the onset of 167 msec presentations of neutral facial expressions. Although subjects reported seeing only neutral faces, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in the amygdala was significantly higher during viewing of masked fearful faces than during the viewing of masked happy faces. This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces, consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli. In addition, these facial expressions activated the sublenticular substantia innominata (SI), where signal increases were observed to both fearful and happy faces--suggesting a spatial dissociation of territories that respond to emotional valence versus salience or arousal value. This study, using fMRI in conjunction with masked stimulus presentations, represents an initial step toward determining the role of the amygdala in nonconscious processing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9412517,N,no corr with phys,,,

Autoregulatory vasodilation can be detected in vivo as an increase in the parenchymal cerebral blood volume (CBV). Regional CBV, CBF, and oxygen extraction fraction in regions with and without angiographic vasospasm obtained from 29 positron emission tomography studies performed after intracranial aneurysm rupture were compared with data from 19 normal volunteers and five patients with carotid artery occlusion. Regional CBF was reduced compared to normal in regions from SAH patients with and without vasospasm as well as with ipsilateral carotid occlusion (P < .0001). Regional oxygen extraction fraction was higher during vasospasm and distal to carotid occlusion than both normal and SAH without vasospasm (P < .0001). Regional CBV was reduced compared to normal in regions with and without spasm, whereas it was increased ipsilateral to carotid occlusion (P < .0001). These findings of reduced parenchymal CBV during vasospasm under similar conditions of tissue hypoxia that produce increased CBV in patients with carotid occlusion provide evidence that parenchymal vessels distal to arteries with angiographic spasm after SAH do not show normal autoregulatory vasodilation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9538907,N,no corr,,,

By use of a transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(MCA)) was measured during a step increase followed by a step decrease in end-tidal CO2 tension (PET(CO2)) between normo- and hypercapnia while subjects inspired gas mixtures containing 70%O2 + 30% N2 (control) and 70% O2 + 30% N2O (N2O) separately. During the control condition, both step increase and decrease in PET(CO2) produced rapid exponential changes in V(MCA). An increase in V(MCA) produced by the step increase in PET(CO2) was smaller (P < 0.001) and slower (P < 0.001) than a decrease in V(MCA) induced by the step decrease in PET(CO2). These general features of the dynamic cerebrovascular response were not affected by substitution of N2O for N2 in the inspired gases although N2O increased baseline V(MCA) by 15% (P < 0.001) compared with the control condition. We conclude that N2(O) in itself does not affect the dynamic cerebrovascular response to arterial CO2 changes, although it produces static mild cerebral vasodilation. IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that nitrous oxide does not affect the dynamic cerebrovascular reactivity to acute arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) changes, i.e., exponential changes in cerebral blood flow in response to step changes in alveolar CO2 tension, although it does produce a mild increase in normocapnic cerebral blood flow velocity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10475306,N,no corr,,,

The aim of the present study was to describe individual growth of sympathetic terminals after HTX by a longitudinal quantitative assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 patients after HTX, dynamic PET with C-11 hydroxyephedrine (HED) was performed twice within 3.0+/-0.5 years. According to the time interval between HTX and first PET, subgroups of patients early (group A, <1.5 years; n=7), intermediate (group B, 1.5 to 7 years; n=7) and late (group C, >7 years; n=6) after HTX were defined. At the time of first HED PET, 10 patients were completely denervated (7 in group A, 2 in group B, and 1 in group C). Only 3 remained denervated at second PET. A significant increase of reinnervated myocardium between first and second PET was found in all 3 groups (0% to 9+/-9% of left ventricle for group A, P<0.05; 13+/-12% to 23+/-17% for group B, P<0.05; 21+/-21% to 37+/-23% for group C, P<0.05). The magnitude of increase was similar between groups. Reinnervation was first surveyed in the basal anterior region, then toward apex, septal, and lateral wall. Inferior wall remained denervated. The largest reinnervated area surveyed in an individuum was 66% of the left ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: The present data confirm the low likelihood of sympathetic reinnervation within 18 months after HTX. Once the reinnervation process is initiated, a continuous growth is observed even late after HTX, suggesting a progressive nature of reinnervation. Reinnervation, however, remained regionally heterogeneous, and a complete restoration was not found until 15 years after HTX.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10199884,N,heart study,,,

In a second experiment, pupil diameter was used to assess cognitive load in 7 individuals studied during overt and covert performance of both Stroop and color naming conditions. Cognitive load was similar in overt and covert response conditions. Results from the BOLD study indicate that brain regions participating in selective visual attention and in the selection of motor programs involved in speech were activated more by the Stroop task than by the baseline tasks. The neural substrate involved in the resolution of the perceptual and motor conflicts elicited by the Stroop Color-Word task does not appear to be a single brain region.

In this study, we have used 18F-labeled 6-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA) together with positron-emission tomography (PET) to estimate the activity of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the ultimate enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine (DA), in the brain of newborn piglets. Simultaneously, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with colored microspheres. Asphyxia elicited an up to threefold increase of the CBF. Despite this, the blood-brain transfer of FDOPA as well as the clearance rate constants from brain were unchanged. However, the synthesis rate of FDA from FDOPA was significantly increased in frontal cortex, striatum, and midbrain.

In the present study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize neuronal responses mediating aversive trace conditioning. During conditioning, neutral auditory tones were paired with an aversive sound [unconditioned stimulus (US)]. We compared neuronal responses evoked by conditioned (CS+) and nonconditioned (CS-) stimuli in which a 50% pairing of CS+ and the US enabled us to limit our analysis to responses evoked by the CS+ alone. Differential responses (CS+ vs CS-), related to conditioning, were observed in anterior cingulate and anterior insula, regions previously implicated in delay fear conditioning. Differential responses were also observed in the amygdala and hippocampus that were best characterized with a time x stimulus interaction, indicating rapid adaptation of CS+-specific responses in medial temporal lobe. These results are strikingly similar to those obtained with a previous delay conditioning experiment and are in accord with a preferential role for medial temporal lobe structures during the early phase of conditioning. However, an additional activation of anterior hippocampus in the present experiment supports a view that its role in trace conditioning is to maintain a memory trace between the offset of the CS+ and the delayed onset of the US to enable associative learning in trace conditioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10594068,N,no corr,,,

A dual-task paradigm of anticipation of electric shocks and a motor-learning task was used to examine the changes in neural patterns of activation associated with modulation of the cognitive state in anxiety by a distracting motor task. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-water to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) in 10 healthy male volunteers. A 2x2 factorial design-(shock vs no shock) x (low vs high distraction) was used with three scans per condition. Twelve PET scans were performed on each subject. In six of these scans, subjects were given electric shocks. In all scans, subjects also simultaneously performed a motor repetition (low distraction) or learning (high distraction) task. Galvanic skin conductance (GSR), Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and self-report data were also collected. In comparisons between the shock and no-shock conditions, the main finding was of increased rcbf in the left insula (-38,8,8) (z = 4.85, P<0.05 corrected) and a homologous area in the right insula at a lower threshold (z =3.20, P = 0.001 uncorrected). Other areas activated were the right superior temporal sulcus, left fusiform, and left anterior cingulate. Using the STAI-state scores as a covariate of interest, significant correlations with rCBF were seen in the left orbitofrontal cortex, left insula, and left anterior cingulate cortex. There was no significant distraction effect as measured by the STAI, self-report, GSR response or interactional analysis of the PET data. These findings support the role of paralimbic structures as neural substrates of anticipatory anxiety. The failure to demonstrate behavioral and neurophysiological changes with the distractor task may reflect the modest increases in anxiety with the shock, the relatively simple distractor task, and small sample size.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10334900,N,no corr with phys,,,

Pharmacological treatments intended to alter cerebral metabolism might also alter radiotracer metabolism, consequently altering the cerebral uptake. First-order rate constants for the metabolism of PET tracers can be calculated by a linear graphical method from the precursor and metabolite concentrations measured in plasma extracts fractionated by HPLC. We tested the effects of specific pharmacological challenges on the plasma kinetics of six tracers used for PET studies of neurotransmission. The rate of O-methylation of circulating [(18)F]fluorodopa, a tracer of dopa decarboxylase activity in brain, was unaffected by pretreatment with amantadine, an antagonist of glutamate receptors. [(11)C]Deprenyl, a tracer of monoamine oxidase activity, was rapidly metabolized to [(11)C]methamphetamine and polar metabolites in healthy volunteers. The net rate constant of this metabolism was three times higher in a group of subjects under treatment for epilepsy, consistent with induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes by antiepileptic drugs.

[(11)C]-(S)-Nicotine, a ligand for nicotinic receptors, was rapidly metabolized to [(11)C]-(S)-cotenine, which is less polar than the parent compound.

[(11)C]Raclopride, a ligand for dopamine D2 receptors, was first metabolized to a nonpolar metabolite, which then yielded two hydrophilic metabolites. The initial metabolic step was substantially blocked by pretreatment with amphetamine, possibly indicative of competitive inhibition of microsomal oxidation.

Four measures, the rate of uptake of tracer into striatum using either the arterial input function (Ki) or the activity in the occipital cortex as the input function (Kc), the rate of loss of striatal radioactivity (k(loss)), and an index of ""effective turnover"" of dopamine (k(loss)/Ki), were obtained for both tracers during extended PET studies. 6-[18F]Fluoro-L-m-tyrosine was as effective as 6FDOPA in separating normals from MPTP-lesioned subjects on the basis of the uptake rate constants Ki and Kc.

Pharmacological doses of glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), is an alternative glucoprivic agent that in contrast to insulin, directly inhibits glycolysis and glucose utilization. Both glucoprivic conditions markedly increase CBF in laboratory animals. How 2DG affects CBF in humans is still undetermined. In the present study we have employed H215O positron emission tomography (PET) to examine the effects of pharmacological doses of 2DG (40 mg/kg) on regional and global cerebral blood flow in 10 brain areas in 13 healthy volunteers. 2DG administration significantly raised regional CBF (rCBF) in the cingulate gyrus, sensorimotor cortex, superior temporal cortex, occipital cortex, basal ganglia, limbic system and hypothalamus. 2DG produced a trend towards elevated CBF in whole brain and frontal cortex, while no changes were observed in the corpus callosum and thalamus. In addition, 2DG significantly decreased body temperature and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Maximal percent changes in hypothalamic rCBF were significantly correlated with maximal changes in body temperature but not with MAP. These results indicate that cerebral glucoprivation produced by pharmacological doses of 2DG is accompanied by widespread activation of cortical and subcortical blood flow and that the blood flow changes in the hypothalamus may be related to 2DG-induced hypothermia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9878763,N,pharma study,,,

Five right-handed human volunteers participated in the study. They were given propofol with a computer-controlled infusion pump to achieve three stable levels of plasma concentrations corresponding to mild sedation, deep sedation, and unconsciousness, the latter defined as unresponsiveness to verbal commands. During awake baseline and each of the three levels of sedation, two scans were acquired after injection of an H215O bolus. Global as well as regional CBF were determined and correlated with propofol concentrations. In addition, blood flow changes in the thalamus were correlated with those of the entire scanned volume to determine areas of coordinated changes. In addition to a generalized decrease in global CBF, large regional decreases in CBF occurred bilaterally in the medial thalamus, the cuneus and precuneus, and the posterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, and right angular gyri. Furthermore, a significant covariation between the thalamic and midbrain blood flow changes was observed, suggesting a close functional relationship between the two structures. We suggest that, at the concentrations attained, propofol preferentially decreases rCBF in brain regions previously implicated in the regulation of arousal, performance of associative functions, and autonomic control. Our data support the hypothesis that anesthetics induce behavioral changes via a preferential, concentration-dependent effect on specific neuronal networks rather than through a nonspecific, generalized effect on the brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10377359,N,pharma study,,,

BACKGROUND: We previously found that VNS acutely induces rCBF alterations at sites that receive vagal afferents and higher-order projections, including dorsal medulla, somatosensory cortex (contralateral to stimulation), thalamus and cerebellum bilaterally, and several limbic structures (including hippocampus and amygdala bilaterally). METHODS: VNS-induced rCBF changes were measured by subtracting resting rCBF from rCBF during VNS, using [O-15]water and PET, immediately before ongoing VNS began, in 11 partial epilepsy patients. T-statistical mapping established relative rCBF increases and decreases for each patient. Percent changes in frequency of complex partial seizures (with or without secondary generalization) during three months of VNS compared with pre-VNS baseline, and T-thresholded rCBF changes (for each of the 25 regions of previously observed significant CBF change), were rank ordered across patients. Spearman rank correlation coefficients assessed associations of seizure-frequency change and t-thresholded rCBF change. RESULTS: Seizure-frequency changes ranged from 71% decrease to 12% increase during VNS. Only the right and left thalami showed significant associations of rCBF change with seizure-frequency change. Increased right and left thalamic CBF correlated with decreased seizures (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased thalamic synaptic activities probably mediate some antiseizure effects of VNS. Future studies should examine neurotransmitter-receptor alterations in reticular and specific thalamic nuclei during VNS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10214738,N,clinical,,,

METHODS: PET studies of myocardial sympathetic innervation, myocardial perfusion and oxygen utilization using [11C]hydroxyephedrine (HED), [13N]ammonia and 1-[11C]acetate, respectively, were performed before and approximately 2 and 8 wk after surgical left thoracotomy and regional chemical sympathetic denervation (n = 5). A second group of animals underwent the same surgical procedure but, so that they could serve as a sham control group, were not sympathetically denervated (n = 5). The second group of animals was imaged before and 2 wk after surgery. Images of the retention of [11C]HED taken from 50 to 60 min postinjection were used to differentiate sympathetically innervated and denervated regions of the left ventricle. Regions of interest were defined on polar plots of the [11C]HED retention, including the sympathetically denervated territory and normally innervated regions. Regions defined on the HED polar plots were then transferred to the [13N]ammonia and 1-[11C]acetate image data, and tracer kinetic models were fit to the regional time-activity curves to generate estimates of myocardial perfusion and oxidative metabolism. RESULTS: The average percentage of the left ventricle denervated in the group I animals was 13.1% +/- 7.3%. Significant reductions in oxidative metabolism were observed in the sympathectomized tissue both at 2 and 8 wk after surgery (22% and 15% reductions, respectively). Significant alterations in regional perfusion were not observed. No significant changes in oxidative metabolism or perfusion were observed in the sham control group.

However, the effects of dipyridamole on cerebral circulation is not pronounced. This study investigates the effects of intravenous dipyridamole on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans with use of positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: In each of 13 healthy subjects, CBF was measured using (15)O-labeled water and PET at rest and during hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and dipyridamole stress; corresponding CBF values were then compared. RESULTS: CBF values during dipyridamole stress were significantly lower than those measured at rest. The dipyridamole stress PaCO(2) was also significantly lower than the resting PaCO(2). The change in CBF during dipyridamole stress relative to PaCO(2) closely followed the relationship between CBF and PaCO(2) during hypocapnia. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the observed decrease in CBF during dipyridamole stress was caused by a decrease in PaCO(2) rather than by any direct action of dipyridamole on CBF. The decrease in PaCO(2) during dipyridamole stress was most likely due to hyperventilation, which was a side effect of adenosine. These results support the hypothesis that circulating adenosine is largely prevented from binding to adenosine receptors of cerebral vessels by the blood-brain barrier.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10436110,N,no coords,,,

We used 4-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify changes in activity in discrete regions of the human brain previously identified in animal studies to be involved in visceral control. Five male subjects underwent heart rate (HR) and/or blood pressure (BP) altering tests: maximal inspiration (MX), Valsalva's maneuver (VM), and isometric handgrip (HG). Increased neuronal activity was observed during MX, VM, and HG, localized in the insular cortex, in the posterior regions of the thalamus, and in the medial prefrontal cortex. To differentiate special visceral (taste) regions from general visceral (HR, BP) regions in these areas, response to gustatory stimulation was also examined; subjects were administered saline (SAL) and sucrose (SUC) solutions as gustatory stimuli. Gustatory stimulation increased activity in the ventral insular cortex at a more inferior level than the cardiopulmonary stimuli.

METHODS: Ten patients whose mean age was 67 +/- 10 years (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) were compared with 10 healthy volunteers who were 25 +/- 3 years of age. Global CBF and CVR were determined using (15)O-H2O and PET prior to shunt placement and 7 days and 7 months thereafter. The CVR was measured using 1 g acetazolamide. Neurological status was assessed based on a score assigned according to the methods of Stein and Langfitt. Seven months after shunt placement, five patients showed clinical improvement (Group A) and five did not (Group B). The average global CBF before shunt deployment was significantly reduced in comparison with the control group (40 +/- 8 compared with 61 +/- 7 ml/100 ml/minute; mean +/- SD, p < 0.01). In Group A the CBF values were significantly lower than in Group B (36 +/- 7 compared with 44 +/- 8 ml/100 ml/minute; p < 0.05). The CVR before surgery, however, was not significantly different between groups (Group A = 43 +/- 21%, Group B = 37 +/- 29%). After shunt placement, there was an increase in the CVR in Group A to 52 +/- 37% after 7 days and to 68 +/- 47% after 7 months (p < 0.05), whereas in Group B the CVR decreased to 14 +/- 18% (p < 0.05) after 7 days and returned to the preoperative level (39 +/- 6%) 7 months after shunt placement. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results indicate that a reduced baseline CBF before surgery does not indicate a poor prognosis. Baseline CBF before shunt placement and preoperative CVR are not predictive of clinical outcome. A decrease in the CVR early after shunt placement, however, is related to poor late clinical outcome, whereas early improvement in the CVR after shunt placement indicates a good prognosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507382,N,clinical,,,

Consecutive fMRI measurements were performed in 10 awake, male volunteers during hypocapnia (mean PE'CO2 3.3 (SD 0.1) kPa) and normocapnia (PE'CO2 5.3 (0.1) kPa) at FIO2 values of 0.21 and 1.0, respectively. Hypocapnia significantly reduced the pixel count in the primary visual cortex (median 169 (quartiles 34-246) vs 21 (0-40) pixels at an FIO2 of 0.21). Additional hyperoxia had no influence on this reduction in pixel count (16 (0-28) pixels at FIO2 1.0 vs 21 (0-40) pixels at FIO2 0.21).

Apomorphine caused an overall increase in beta activity at time 0.5 h in both absolute and relative energy; P300 and CNV ERPs were not significantly altered, although a tendency towards increased P300 latency was seen. The results confirm that the EEG mapping technique is sufficiently sensitive to monitor dopaminergic neurochemical stimulation by means of apomorphine. This could lead to a new, non-invasive and repeatable method for monitoring central neuronal systems which is more convenient to apply repeatedly than for example positron emission tomography techniques. Furthermore, electrophysiological techniques undoubtedly constitute an alternative to classical neuroendocrinological methods, allowing a more direct assessment of central nervous system neurotransmission.

Close relations with the antero-inferior cerebellar artery in the intracisternal and intracanalicular segments must be known. Gadolinium enhancement is usual in the fallopian canal with variable intensity and thickness and should be differentiated from pathological enhancement.

Seven subjects were connected to a ventilator and randomly ventilated on assist-volume control (AVC), pressure support (PS) or proportional assist ventilation (PAV). On each mode, the assist level was set to the highest comfortable level. Airway and oesophageal (Poes) pressures, tidal volume, respiratory frequency (fR) and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PET,CO2) were measured breath-by-breath. When the subjects were stable on each mode, the fraction of inspired carbon dioxide (FI,CO2) was increased stepwise, and changes in minute ventilation (V'E) and respiratory motor output, estimated by the pressure-time product of all the respiratory muscles per breath (PTPrm) and per minute (PTPminute), were observed. At zero FI,CO2, PTPminute/PET,CO2 did not differ between modes, while V'E/ PTPminute was significantly lower with PAV than that with PS and AVC. As a result V'E/PET,CO2 was significantly lower with PAV, preventing, unlike AVC and PS, a significant drop in PET,CO2. With PAV, independent of CO2, V'E/PTPminute remained constant, while it decreased significantly with increasing CO2 stimulus with PS and AVC. At high PET,CO2 respiratory effort was significantly lower with PAV than that with PS and AVC. In conclusion, the mode of mechanical ventilation modifies the effects of chemical feedback on respiratory motor and ventilatory output.

The accuracy of this model was examined by comparing the predicted values against measured values for blood sampled from the internal jugular vein, which was used as a measure of the partial pressure in the brain. METHODS: Our model consists of six compartments: alveoli, arterial blood, a group of vessel-rich organs (VRG), muscle, fat, and venous blood. A volatile anesthetic, sevoflurane partial pressure in each compartment were calculated using the parameters of volume, blood flow, and solubility for each tissue as reported in previous studies. Simulated sevoflurane partial pressures in VRG were considered to reflect those in the brain. We studied 11 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery or mastectomy. Sevoflurane was maintained at a concentration of 3% (by vaporizer setting) for 25 min. Sampling points were at 0 min (before sevoflurane administration) and 1, 2, 4, 9, 16, and 25 min after the start of inhalation. We measured the sevoflurane partial pressure in inspiratory gas (PI(S)), in end-expiratory gas (PET(S)), in arterial blood (Pa(S)), and in internal jugular vein blood (Pj(S)). These values were compared against those for the simulated brain (PB(S)sim). RESULTS: The sevoflurane partial pressures increased, in order from least rapid to most rapid, as follows: Pj(S), PB(S)sim, Pa(S), PET(S), and PI(S). The differences between Pj(S) and PB(S)sim were significantly smaller than those between Pj(S) and PET(S) at all sampling points. PB(S)sim did not differ significantly from Pj(S) at any sampling points after 4 min of inhalation, while PET(S) differed significantly from Pj(S) at all sampling points.

In the territory of the occlusive lesion, % CBFhypotension correlated significantly with % CBFhypercapnia (r = 0.793, P < 0.002) in the symptomatic hemispheres. In the brain regions in which trimethaphan did not induce a reduction in CBF. % CBFhypercapnia was 6.13 +/- 1.79.

In the asymptomatic hemispheres, % CBFhypotension also correlated with % CBFhypercapnia (r = 0.979, P < 0.0001). Failure to maintain CBF during induced hypotension was associated with diminished cerebrovascular vasoreactivity to hypercapnia in patients with arterial disease. This may indicate that failure of autoregulation can be assessed by the CBF response to both induced hypotension and CO2 inhalation.

The object of this study was to investigate the degree to which the hyperventilation and hypocapnia can induce the changes known as ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia, in the absence of the primary hypoxic stimulus itself. 2. Three 6 h protocols were each performed on twelve healthy volunteers: (1) passive hypocapnic hyperventilation, with end-tidal CO2 pressure (PET,CO2) held 10 Torr below the eupnoeic value; (2) passive eucapnic hyperventilation, with PET,CO2 maintained eucapnic; (3) control. 3. Ventilatory responses to acute hypercapnia and hypoxia were assessed before and half an hour after each protocol. 4. The presence of prior hypocapnia, but not prior hyperventilation, caused a reduction in air-breathing PET,CO2 (P < 0.05, ANOVA), and a leftwards shift of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia (P < 0.05). The presence of prior hyperventilation, but not prior hypocapnia, caused an increase in the ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 (P < 0.05). No significant effects of any protocol were detected on the ventilatory sensitivity to hypoxia. 5. We conclude that following 6 h of passive hyperventilation: (i) the left shift of the VE-PET,CO2 relationship is due to alkalosis and not to hyperventilation; (ii) the increase in slope of the VE-PET,CO2 relationship is due to the hyperventilation and not the alkalosis; and (iii) ventilatory sensitivity to hypoxia is unaltered.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9882758,N,no corr,,,

After a follow-up period of twelve months, 8 patients had died, 13 remained in a permanent vegetative state and three showed moderate improvement of consciousness, without however regaining independence for activities of daily life. As expected, overall glucose utilization (CMRglc) was significantly reduced in VS in comparison to age matched controls. Infratentorial structures showed a less distinct hypometabolism. Differences in metabolic rates between patients who died or remained in a PVS were small and insignificant and probably reflect different age structures of the two groups. A statistically significant correlation between the degree of evoked potential or EEG alterations in VS and the reduction of global or regional cortical metabolic rates for glucose could not be established. Cortical metabolic rates in patients with PVS were significantly reduced when compared to patients studied in AVS (p<0.05 for all cortical regions of interest except the frontal lobe). This phenomenon reflects the progressive loss of residual cortical function following anoxic brain injury that corresponds to the neuropathological findings of progressive Wallerian and transsynaptic degeneration as sequelae of anoxic brain injury in PVS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9890381,N,clinical,,,

The segmental patterns of the two types of SPECT images were compared with PET [13N]NH3 studies performed in the same patient. PET images were taken as reference and the diagnostic accuracy of SPECT with(out) attenuation correction was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the SPECT study transmission and emission data were simultaneously recorded by a triple head gamma camera equipped with fan beam collimators and a 99mTc transmission line source (740MBq). SPECT and PET images, the former reconstructed with(out) attenuation correction, were corecorded and reoriented along the short axis. The left ventricular wall was divided into 11 segments and segmental activity normalized to maximum in each study. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between PET/(un)corrected SPECT ratios in posterior and septal segments. In these myocardial regions, attenuation correction compensates for attenuation artifacts, by correcting the underestimation of radioactivity concentration caused by radiation absorption. A statistically significant difference was also found in midventricular anterior and apical segments (p < .05). However, in these regions attenuation correction results in a decrease in corrected relative to uncorrected SPECT activity. The agreement rate with PET data is higher for corrected SPECT (mean differences were 3.12 +/- 11.51 and 2.19 +/- 8.63 for uncorrected versus corrected SPET). We had 50% positive and 77% negative predictive value without attenuation correction, versus up to 69% and 90%, respectively, with attenuation correction. CONCLUSIONS: The attenuation correction procedure with simultaneous transmission-emission effectively reduces attenuation artifacts in SPECT myocardial imaging. While diagnostic accuracy increases in posterior and septal myocardial regions, anterior and apical data need careful interpretation because a relative decrease in radioactivity concentration can be observed after attenuation correction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10566294,N,spect,,,

Arterialized venous blood was sampled from a dorsal hand vein at 2 min intervals during SR and 30 s intervals during FR and analysed for arterial plasma PCO2 (PaCO2). PET,CO2 increased with increasing work rates (WRs) below the ventilatory threshold (VT); at WRs > or = 90% VO2,max, PET,CO2 was reduced (P < 0.05) below 0 W values in SR but not in FR.fb and VT were similar for SR and FR at all submaximal WRs, resulting in a similar VE. At exhaustion VE was similar but fb was higher (P < 0.05) and VT was lower (P < 0.05) in SR (fb, 51 +/- 10 breaths min-1; VT, 2590 +/- 590 ml) than in FR (fb, 42 +/- 8 breaths min-1; VT, 3050 +/- 470 ml). The time of expiration (TE) decreased with increasing WR, but there was no difference between SR and FR.

Eight male subjects underwent six measurements of regional brain activity following the administration of [15O]H2O as they viewed three categories of film clips: sexually explicit clips, emotionally neutral control clips, and humorous control clips inducing positive but nonsexual emotions. Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to identify brain regions demonstrating an increased activity associated with the sexual response to the visual stimulus. Visually evoked sexual arousal was characterized by a threefold pattern of activation: the bilateral activation of the inferior temporal cortex, a visual association area; the activation of the right insula and right inferior frontal cortex, which are two paralimbic areas relating highly processed sensory information with motivational states; and the activation of the left anterior cingulate cortex, another paralimbic area known to control autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. Activation of some of these areas was positively correlated with plasma testosterone levels.

We used 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose and positron emission tomography combined with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique to compare the ability of insulin to stimulate myocardial, skeletal muscle, and whole body glucose uptake between weight lifters (n = 8), endurance athletes (n = 8), and sedentary men (n = 9). Maximal aerobic power (ml. kg- 1. min- 1) was higher in the endurance athletes (71 +/- 2, P < 0.001) than the weight lifters (42 +/- 2) and the sedentary men (42 +/- 2). Skeletal muscle glucose uptake (micromol. kg muscle- 1. min- 1) was enhanced in the endurance athletes (125 +/- 16, P < 0.01) but was similar in weight lifters (59 +/- 12) and sedentary (63 +/- 7) men. The rate of glucose uptake per unit mass of myocardium (micromol. kg- 1. min- 1) was similarly decreased in endurance athletes (544 +/- 50) and weight lifters (651 +/- 45) compared with sedentary men (1,041 +/- 78, P < 0.001 vs. endurance athletes and weight lifters). Both groups of athletes had increased left ventricular mass. Consequently, total left ventricular glucose uptake was comparable in all groups. These data demonstrate that aerobic but not resistance training is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Despite this, cardiac changes are remarkably similar in weight lifters and endurance athletes and are characterized by an increase in left ventricular mass and diminished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake per heart mass.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10198307,N,no brain data,,,

The role of the sex steroid binding protein (SBP or SHBG) in the transport of the [18F]-FES to the estrogen-receptor-rich tissue in breast cancer patients in vivo was investigated. To determine the extent to which [18F]-FES is bound to SBP in the blood, we performed a series of studies using blood samples obtained from patients undergoing [18F]-FES PET scans. The binding of [18F]-FES to the SBP was measured using a simple protein precipitation assay. The binding of [18F]-FES metabolites to SBP was also measured. These measurements showed that the tracer was distributed between albumin and SBP, and the binding capacity of SBP was sufficient to ensure that the protein was not saturated when the tracer was fully mixed with the plasma; however, local saturation of SBP may occur when [18F]-FES is administered intravenously. Typically about 45% of [18F]-FES in circulating plasma was bound to SBP, but this fraction was dependent on the concentration of SBP in plasma. The transfer of the tracer between the two proteins was rapid, complete in less than 20 s at 0 degrees C, suggesting that the equilibrium was maintained under most circumstances and that local saturation resolved quickly when blood from the injection site entered the central circulation. These data suggest that SBP binding of [18F]-FES is significant and will affect the input function of the tracer for any model that is used for the quantitative evaluation of [18F]-FES uptake in PET studies. Estimates of equilibrium binding in blood samples are sufficient to characterize [18F]-FES binding to SBP in the circulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10708304,N,no phys of interest,,,

Though cocaine and methylphenidate have similar in vitro affinities for DAT the abuse of methylphenidate in humans is substantially lower than of cocaine. To test if differences in in vivo potency at the DAT between these two drugs could account for the differences in their abuse liability we compared the levels of DAT occupancies that we had previously reported separately for intravenous methylphenidate in controls and for intravenous cocaine in cocaine abusers. DAT occupancies were measured with Positron Emission Tomography using [11C]cocaine, as a DAT ligand, in 8 normal controls for the methylphenidate study and in 17 active cocaine abusers for the cocaine study. The ratio of the distribution volume of [11C]cocaine in striatum to that in cerebellum, which corresponds to Bmax/Kd +1, was used as measure of DAT availability. Parallel measures were obtained to assess the cardiovascular effects of these two drugs. Methylphenidate and cocaine produced comparable dose-dependent blockade of DAT with an estimated ED50 (dose required to block 50% of the DAT) for methylphenidate of 0.07 mg/kg and for cocaine of 0.13 mg/kg. Both drugs induced similar increases in heart rate and blood pressure but the duration of the effects were significantly longer for methylphenidate than for cocaine. The similar in vivo potencies at the DAT for methylphenidate than for cocaine are in agreement with their reported relative in vitro affinities (Ki 390 nM and 640 nM respectively), which is likely to reflect the similar degree of uptake (8-10% of the injected dose) and regional distribution of these two drugs in the human brain. Thus, differences in the in vivo potency of these two drugs at the DAT cannot be responsible for the differences in their rate of abuse in humans. Other variables i.e. longer duration of methylphenidate's side effects may counterbalance its reinforcing effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403500,N,pharma study,,,

In a number of animal models NO has been implicated in the mediation of the regional changes in CBF (rCBF) that accompany neuronal activation (vasoneuronal coupling). However, some results in animal models have failed to confirm this finding, and the validity of extrapolation to man from animal data is uncertain. To determine the contribution of NO to basal global CBF and activation-induced changes in rCBF, the authors have performed quantitative H2(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) studies before and after administration of the non-isoform-specific NO synthase inhibitor, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), in 10 healthy male volunteers. Learning a novel sequence of finger movements was used as a paradigm to induce regional frontal cortex activation. The effect of NO synthase inhibition on the magnitude and pattern of activation was determined. Resting global CBF fell from 33.3 +/- 5.3 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) at rest before L-NMMA, to 26.5 +/- 7.7 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) after L-NMMA (P = 0.001). This fall was reversed by L-arginine administration. Learning sequential finger movements induced increases in rCBF in the left motor, right prefrontal, and bilateral premotor cortices. After NO synthase inhibition with L-NMMA, there was no change in this pattern of activation and no reduction in the magnitude of rCBF responses at the foci of maximal stimulation before and after L-NMMA. These findings confirm that NO production contributes to basal CBF regulation in man, but show that systemic NO synthase inhibition with L-NMMA does not impair regional vasoneuronal coupling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10366198,N,no corr,,,

To determine the magnitude and time course of changes in respiratory motor output caused by non-chemical influences, six sleeping subjects underwent assist-control mechanical ventilation (ACMV) at increased tidal volume (VT). During ACMV, end-tidal PCO2 (PET,CO2) was either held at normocapnic levels (PET,CO2, 0.6-1.1 mmHg > control) by adding CO2 to the inspirate, or it was allowed to fall (hypocapnia). 2. Each sleeping subject underwent several repeat trials of twenty-five ACMV breaths (VT, 1.3 or 2.1 times control; peak flow rate, 30-40 l min-1; inspiratory time, +/- 0.3 s of control). The end-tidal to arterial PCO2 difference throughout normocapnic ACMV at raised VT was unchanged from eupnoeic levels during studies in wakefulness. 3. Normocapnic ACMV at both the smaller and larger increases in VT decreased the amplitude of respiratory motor output, as judged by decreased maximum rate of rise of mask pressure (Pm) (mean dPm/dtmax, 46-68% of control), reduced diaphragmatic EMG (to 55% of control) and reduced VT on the first spontaneous breath after ACMV (to 70% of control). Expiratory time (TE) was slightly prolonged (13-32% > control). This inhibition of amplitude of respiratory motor output progressed over the first five to seven ventilator cycles, was maintained over the remaining 18-20 cycles and persisted for three to five spontaneous breaths immediately following cessation of ACMV. 4. Hypocapnia did not further inhibit respiratory motor output amplitude beyond the effect of normocapnic ACMV at high VT, but did cause highly variable prolongation of TE when PET,CO2 was reduced by greater than 3 mmHg for at least five ventilator cycles. 5. These data in sleeping humans support the existence of a significant, non-chemical inhibitory influence of ACMV at increased VT and positive pressure upon the amplitude of respiratory motor output; this effect is manifested both during and following normocapnic mechanical ventilation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10381605,N,no brain data,,,

Talairach coordinates-transformed imaging data were averaged for a group analysis. RESULTS: Acupuncture at LI.4 and ST.36 resulted in significantly higher scores for De-Qi and in substantial bradycardia. Acupuncture at both acupoints resulted in activation of the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and deactivation of the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala formation, and hippocampal complex; control stimulations did not result in such activations and deactivations. CONCLUSION: Functional MR imaging can demonstrate the CNS pathway for acupuncture stimulation. Acupuncture at ST.36 and LI.4 activates structures of descending antinociceptive pathway and deactivates multiple limbic areas subserving pain association. These findings may shed light on the CNS mechanism of acupuncture analgesia and form a basis for future investigations of endogenous pain modulation circuits in the human brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10405732,N,no corr,,,

The activity in the brains of 17 subjects who were deeply in love was scanned using fMRI, while they viewed pictures of their partners, and compared with the activity produced by viewing pictures of three friends of similar age, sex and duration of friendship as their partners. The activity was restricted to foci in the medial insula and the anterior cingulate cortex and, subcortically, in the caudate nucleus and the putamen, all bilaterally. Deactivations were observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in the amygdala and were right-lateralized in the prefrontal, parietal and middle temporal cortices. The combination of these sites differs from those in previous studies of emotion, suggesting that a unique network of areas is responsible for evoking this affective state.

Despite similar stimulus ratings in male and female patients, regional activations were much stronger for males. In both experiments, rectal pressure activated the insula bilaterally in males but not in females.

Changes in Thorax(ICW) were compared with positron emission tomography-determined C(15)O-labeled erythrocytes over the heart. During -40 mmHg LBNP, the blood volume of the heart decreased by 21 +/- 3% as the erythrocyte volume was reduced by 20 +/- 2% and the plasma volume declined by 26 +/- 2% (P < 0.01; n = 8).

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study the mechanisms mediating this specific effect in healthy, right-handed human males (ages 18-28 yr). Subjects received either painful cold (n = 11) or painless vibratory (n = 9) stimulation before and after the intravenous injection of fentanyl (1.5 microgram/kg) or placebo (saline). Compared with cool water (29 degrees C), immersion of the hand in ice water (1 degrees C) is painful and produces highly significant increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) within the contralateral second somatosensory (S2) and insular cortex, bilaterally in the thalamus and cerebellum, and medially in the cerebellar vermis. Responses just below the statistical threshold (3.5 < Z < 4.0) are seen in the contralateral anterior cingulate, ipsilateral insular cortex, and dorsal medial midbrain. The contralateral primary sensory cortex (S1) shows a trend of activation. Except for slight changes in intensity, this pattern is unchanged following a saline placebo injection. Fentanyl reduces the average visual analogue scale ratings of perceived pain intensity (47%) and unpleasantness (50%), reduces pain-related cardioacceleration, and has positive hedonic effects. After fentanyl, but not placebo, all cortical and subcortical responses to noxious cold are greatly reduced. Subtraction analysis [(innocuous water + fentanyl) - (innocuous water + no injection)] shows that fentanyl alone increases rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, particularly in the perigenual region. Vibration (compared with mock vibration) evokes highly significant rCBF responses in the contralateral S1 cortex in the baseline (no injection) and placebo conditions; borderline responses (3.5 < Z < 4. 0) are detected also in the contralateral thalamus. Fentanyl has no effect on the perceived intensity or unpleasantness of vibratory stimulation, which continues to activate contralateral S1. Fentanyl alone [(mock vibration + fentanyl) - (mock vibration + no injection)] again produces highly significant activation of the perigenual and mid-anterior cingulate cortex. A specific comparison of volumes of interest, developed from activation peaks in the baseline condition (no injection), shows that fentanyl strongly attenuates both the contralateral thalamic and S1 cortical responses to noxious cold stimulation (P < 0.048 and 0.007, respectively) but fails to affect significantly these responses to vibrotactile stimulation (P > 0.26 and 0.91, respectively). In addition, fentanyl, compared with placebo, produces a unique activation of the mid-anterior cingulate cortex during fentanyl analgesia, suggesting that this region of the cingulate cortex participates actively in mediating opioid analgesia. The results are consistent with a selective, fentanyl-mediated suppression of nociceptive spinothalamic transmission to the forebrain. This effect could be implemented directly at the spinal level, indirectly through cingulate corticofugal pathways, or by a combination of both mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10899224,N,no corr,,,

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain activity associated with spontaneous fluctuations in amplitude of SCR, and activity corresponding to generation and afferent representation of discrete SCR events. Regions that covaried with increased SCR included right orbitofrontal cortex, right anterior insula, left lingual gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, and left cerebellum. At a less stringent level of significance, predicted areas in bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and right inferior parietal lobule covaried with SCR. Generation of discrete SCR events was associated with significant activity in left medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral extrastriate visual cortices, and cerebellum. Activity in right medial prefrontal cortex related to afferent representation of SCR events. Activity in bilateral medial prefrontal lobe, right orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral extrastriate visual cortices was common to both generation and afferent representation of discrete SCR events identified in a conjunction analysis.

Six healthy volunteer subjects underwent H215O positron emission tomography (PET) scanning while performing isometric exercise and mental arithmetic stressor tasks, and during corresponding control tasks. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored during scanning. 3. Data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Conjunction analyses were used to determine significant changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during states of cardiovascular arousal common to both exercise and mental stressor tasks. 4. Exercise and mental stressor tasks, relative to their control tasks, were associated with significantly (P < 0.001) increased MAP and HR. Significant common activations (increased rCBF) were observed in cerebellar vermis, brainstem and right anterior cingulate. In both exercise and mental stress tasks, increased rCBF in cerebellar vermis, right anterior cingulate and right insula covaried with MAP; rCBF in pons, cerebellum and right insula covaried with HR. Cardiovascular arousal in both categorical and covariance analyses was associated with decreased rCBF in prefrontal and medial temporal regions. 5.

Nine male and nine female healthy adult smokers were studied. They abstained overnight from tobacco products for 10 or more hours prior to study the next morning. Nicotine nasal spray was given in doses of 1-2.5 mg total with half in each nostril while the subject was awake and resting in a supine position. Oleoresin of pepper solution in a similar volume was used as an active placebo to control for the irritating effects of nicotine. Both substances were given single blind to the subjects. Positron emission tomography (PET) with H(2)(15)O was used to measure rCBF. The data from each subject volunteer were normalized to global activity to better assess regional brain changes. Both nasal nicotine and pepper spray produced similar increases in CBF in somesthetic area II, consistent with the irritant effects of both substances. The mean rCBF effects of nasal pepper were subtracted from those of nasal nicotine to determine the actions of nicotine alone. The latter produced increases in rCBF in the thalamus, pons, Brodman area 17 of the visual cortex, and cerebellum. Some brain areas that contain a large number of nAChRs, such as the thalamus, showed an increase in CBF. Other areas that have few nAChRs, such as the cerebellum, also showed an increase in relative CBF. The hippocampal/parahippocampal areas showed greater regional decreases (left) and lesser increases (right) in CBF that correlated with the increase in plasma arterial nicotine concentrations. The results obtained indicate complex primary and secondary effects of nicotine in which only some regional brain CBF changes correlate with the known distribution of nAChR.

The goal of this study was to elucidate this mechanism further. METHODS: The authors estimated cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), O2 extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV) preoperatively in eight patients with aneurysmal SAH (one man and seven women, mean age 63.5 years) within 40 hours of onset by using positron emission tomography (PET). The patients' CBF, CMRO2, and CBF/CBV were significantly lower than those in normal control volunteers. However, OEF and CBV did not differ significantly from those in control volunteers. The significant decrease in CBF/CBV, which indicates reduced cerebral perfusion pressure, was believed to be caused by impaired cerebral circulation due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) after rupture of the aneurysm. In two of the eight patients, uncoupling between CBF and CMRO2 was shown, strongly suggesting the presence of cerebral ischemia.

Resting-state baseline fluctuations were evaluated in 12 children anesthetized with thiopental. Five subjects had fluctuations related to subvoxel motion. In seven subjects without significant motion, slow signal fluctuation at 0.025-0.041 Hz near one or more primary sensory cortices was observed. In each subject the amplitude and frequency of the fluctuations were stable. It is hypothesized that thiopental, which reduces blood pressure and flow in the cortex, alters the feedback in neurovascular coupling leading to an increase in the magnitude and a reduction in the frequency of these fluctuations. The use of anesthesia in fMRI may provide new insight into neural connectivity and the coupling of blood flow and neural metabolism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10975887,N,children,,,

Images (1024) of a slice perpendicular to the aqueduct were acquired with a repetition time of 107 msec and a flip angle of 90 degrees. This imaging technique is very sensitive for flow into the selected slice, although a quantitative assessment of flow velocities is not possible. Simultaneously with the image data acquisition, data from a pulse oximeter and a respiration belt were recorded. For each data point, a delay time to the preceding cardiac pulse was determined from the recorded pulse wave. The signal intensities could then be assigned to the cardiac cycle. Each cardiac interval was assigned to one of eight respiratory phases, and an average signal curve during the cardiac interval was calculated for each respiration phase. The evaluation showed to signal maxima within the cardiac interval, which could be identified as a downward flow at 10% and an upward flow at 80% of the cardiac pulse interval by measurements with additional saturation pulses. In examinations of 22 healthy volunteers, an influence of respiration on the flow through the aqueduct was found. In spite of interindividual variability, comparable effects could be observed in all volunteers.

To investigate differences between the two groups in response to reward, the experimental design consisted of three reinforcement conditions: no reinforcement consisting of nonsense feedback, positive symbolic reinforcement and monetary reward. In the controls, monetary reward activated bilaterally the striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as unilaterally the left cerebellum, midbrain and medial frontal gyrus. Symbolic reinforcement revealed a similar pattern of activation, except that the striatum and left midbrain showed no activation. The Parkinsonian patients responded to monetary reward with increased activation bilaterally in the cerebellum, medial frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as unilaterally in the right fusiform gyrus and midbrain and left caudate nucleus and precentral gyrus. Symbolic reinforcement induced significantly increased rCBF in the right cerebellum only. Compared with symbolic reinforcement, monetary reward produced extended activation of temporoparietal association cortex.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven healthy volunteers and 10 patients were investigated after heart transplantation. PET images of both tracers were of excellent quality in the volunteers. Values for radiolabeled metabolites (measured in percent of blood activity) at 5, 20, and 60 minutes after injection were approximately 35%, approximately 82%, and approximately 86% for EPI and approximately 13%, approximately 47%, and approximately 78% for HED, respectively. At 35 minutes, metabolite-corrected mean myocardial retention fraction of EPI (0. 235+/-0.022 min(-1)) was significantly greater (P<0.01) than that of HED (0.142+/-0.012 min(-1)). Corrected tracer retention fractions of both EPI and HED were significantly reduced in transplant recipients (0.055+/-0.004 min(-1), P<0.0001; and 0.050+/-0.006 min(-1), P<0. 0001, respectively) compared with volunteers. Normalization of retention fractions of patients with transplantation within 1 year to volunteers resulted in a value (ratio expressed in percent) of 20. 6+/-1.8% for EPI, significantly (P<0.03) smaller than 27.8+/-0.8% for HED. In patients with transplantation later than 1 year, the values were 26.0+/-2.9% for EPI compared with 44.2+/-5.6% for HED (P<0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Both tracers showed high selectivity for neuronal uptake in the heart, with a significant reduction in tracer retention in transplant recipients compared with volunteers. Compared with HED, EPI showed greater retention in volunteers and a lower retention ratio in transplant recipients, suggesting that EPI may be the superior tracer with higher sensitivity to neuronal abnormalities. Because EPI reflects neuronal uptake, metabolism, and storage, it may be more suitable for the study of neuronal integrity than HED, which primarily traces uptake-1 capacity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10662749,N,no phys of interest,,,

The precise identification of the anatomical cerebral structures involved in micturition can contribute to a better understanding of the control of micturition and the development of therapeutic models. Various neuropathological and animal studies have referred to the medulla oblongata, pons, limbic system, superior frontal lobe and premotor cortical regions as areas implicated in micturition control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the activity of these areas during micturition can be confirmed by PET in normal men. The distribution of the regional cerebral blood flow after bolus injection of (15)O water was used as an indirect measure of cerebral activation. PET scans were performed during the following three conditions: (i) at rest with the bladder empty; (ii) during simulated micturition after instillation of isotonic saline into the urinary bladder; and (iii) the withholding of urine (saline). Normal micturition using this model was achieved in eight out of 12 right-handed normal subjects. The changes in bladder contraction, bladder pressure and intra-abdominal pressure were monitored on-line during the whole scanning session by a cystometry device. The images were analysed using statistical parametric mapping at a significance threshold of P < 0.05 with correction for multiple independent comparisons. Micturition versus rest was associated with bilateral activation of areas close to the postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, globus pallidus, cortex cerebelli, vermis and midbrain. On the left side, activation of the middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, superior precentral gyrus, thalamus and the caudal part of the anterior cingulate gyrus was seen, while on the right side we found activation in the supramarginal gyrus, mesencephalon and insula. When the threshold value was lowered to P < 0.001 (Z > 3.09) without correction for multiple comparisons, we found additional activation in the medial pontine tegmentum, mesencephalon, right thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus and left insula. When urine- withholding was compared with rest, the left insula showed a tendency to activate. We conclude from this study, in which urinary bladder contraction was verified cystometrically, that the onset and maintenance of micturition in normal men is associated with a vast network of cortical and subcortical regions, confirming observations from clinical and animal studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10734009,N,no phys of interest,,,

The painful stimulus consisted of the standard cold pressor test and the cognitive task was a computerised perceptual maze test. The activations during the maze test reproduced findings in previous studies of the same cognitive task. The cold pressor test evoked significant activity in the contralateral S1, and bilaterally in the somatosensory association areas (including S2), the ACC and the mid-insula. The activity in the somatosensory association areas and periaqueductal gray/midbrain were significantly modified, i.e. relatively decreased, when the subjects also were performing the maze task. The altered activity was accompanied with significantly lower ratings of pain during the cognitive task. In contrast, lateral orbitofrontal regions showed a relative increase of activity during pain combined with the maze task as compared to only pain, which suggests the possibility of the involvement of frontal cortex in modulation of regions processing pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10692599,N,no phys of interest,,,

The claustrum, a region whose function had been unclear, displayed one of the highest activations. Additionally, activations were recorded in paralimbic areas (anterior cingulate gyrus, orbito-frontal cortex), in the striatum (head of caudate nucleus, putamen), and in the posterior hypothalamus.

However, it correlates poorly with the extent of myocardial ischaemia and with prognosis. In order to understand more fully the heterogeneity of the experience of chest pain, we have adopted the technique of functional neuroimaging, where positron emission tomography is used to measure regional cerebral blood flow as an index of regional neuronal activation, during myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease. We have been able to delineate those brain areas that are involved in the perception of angina: the hypothalamus, periaquaductal grey, thalami and bilaterally the prefrontal cortex and in the left the inferior anterocaudal cingulate cortex. By studying patients with silent myocardial ischaemia, we have established that the silence is not merely a matter of impaired afferent signalling resulting from autonomic neuropathy, but that it is associated with a failure of transmission of signals from the thalamus to the frontal cortex. At the other end of the spectrum, we have studied patients with syndrome X, a condition of chest pain with ischaemic-like stress electrocardiography (ECG) but entirely normal coronary angiogram; (on the basis of our own and other data we consider an ischaemic aetiology to be most unlikely in this condition). In syndrome X, distinct patterns of cerebral activation were found with characteristic activation of the right anterior insula at its junction with the frontal operculum. In conclusion, we present a unified view of the cerebral handling of afferent signals from the heart throughout this spectrum of experience of chest pain, a view that accounts for the clinical features of the patients studied.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10949067,N,no corr,,,

We assessed the effects of blood gas changes, within the range encountered during mild obstructive apnea-arousal cycles, on GG activity and the GG reflex to upper airway negative pressure. Eighteen healthy adults were studied while awake under 5 conditions: (1) baseline (PET(CO(2)) = 40 mm Hg, Sa(O(2)) = 99%); (2) hypercapnia (PET(CO(2)) = 45 mm Hg); (3) hypocapnia (PET(CO(2)) = 35 mm Hg, induced via hyperventilation with an iron lung ventilator); (4) hypoxia (Sa(O(2)) = 87%); and (5) hypercapnia plus hypoxia (PET(CO(2)) = 45 mm Hg, Sa(O(2)) = 87%). Measurements included airflow, choanal and epiglottic pressures (Pchoa and Pepi), upper airway resistance, phasic and tonic GG EMG, and the GG reflex to negative pressure (Pchoa = -12.5 cm H(2)O). Ventilation increased from a baseline of 10.7 up to 22.7 L. min(-1) under conditions of altered blood gases. Peak inspiratory phasic GG EMG increased from 6. 5 to 11.1% of maximal contraction but there were no significant changes in either tonic GG EMG (range, 4.3 to 5.8% of maximum) or magnitude of the GG reflex (range, 4.1 to 5.5% of maximum). Among conditions there was a high correlation between upper airway pressures and peak phasic GG EMG (Pchoa, r = 0.97, p < 0.01; Pepi, r = 0.87; p = 0.06). We conclude that in this range of blood gases: (1) the GG reflex to negative pressure is unchanged; (2) slow airway pressure changes throughout inspiration, generated either actively or passively, influence GG EMG activity; and (3) mechanoreceptive control of GG EMG can fully explain all changes in GG activity, suggesting that chemoreceptive inputs to GG are minimal, or are not simply summated with mechanoreceptor inputs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10934087,N,no phys of interest,,,

We studied 15 patients who had cirrhosis of the liver with underlying viral infection. After the intravenous injection of H2(15)O, positron emission tomography was performed. Blood samples were obtained after beginning the emission scan. The blood samples and positron emission tomographic images were analysed to calculate the radioactivity in the blood and liver. One-compartment model analysis was used to estimate hepatic arterial and portal blood flow.

Three subject groups were evaluated: normal controls, subjects with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), and subjects with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). All underwent a number of PET scans using 15O-water, with half before and half after a single dose of guanfacine.

In the FLE group a decrease in rCBF was seen in the dorsal prefrontal cortex on the epileptogenic side with only small increases seen in the mid- to anterior temporal perisylvian areas. The ability of alpha-2 agonists to enhance performance of tasks reliant on prefrontal cortex, without improving tasks believed to rely on intact temporal-hippocampal function, may be explained by these results.

The mean iEMG, postexercise hyperemia, and plasma lactate concentration were all elevated with the increase in occlusion pressure at a low-intensity exercise, whereas they were unchanged with the increase in occlusion pressure at high-intensity exercise. To investigate the long-term effects of low-intensity exercise with occlusion, older women (n = 24) were subjected to a 16-wk exercise training for elbow flexor muscles, in which low-intensity [ approximately 50-30% one repetition maximum (1 RM)] exercise with occlusion at approximately 110 mmHg (LIO), low-intensity exercise without occlusion (LI), and high- to medium-intensity ( approximately 80-50% 1 RM) exercise without occlusion (HI) were performed.

Skin conductance increased during all picture conditions. Relative to the non-aversive pictures, aversive image content caused modulation of occipital and occipital-temporal cortex. These results demonstrated activation of the amygdala to salient, arousing stimuli, and not just aversive stimuli. In addition, they suggest that pictorial complexity, as indexed by our semantic measure, does not account for the modulation of visual cortex by aversive, emotional stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10869585,N,no corr,,,

Results revealed spatially distinct responses for trials invoking a narrow versus wide attentional focus. Under arousal a wide focus showed posterior thalamic activation similar to that associated with the narrowed attentional focus. This reflects altered stimulus filtering and supported the hypothesis. Relevant neuroanatomy involving the locus coeruleus and a triangular circuit of selective attention is discussed.

Using PET and [18] FDG (to measure regional brain glucose metabolism, which serves as an index of brain function) we compared the regional brain metabolic activity between healthy subjects with bradycardia (<60 beats per minute) with those with normal heart rates in the 75-100 beats per minute range. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) analyses revealed significant differences between the groups predominantly localized to the temporal insula. This finding was corroborated by a separate analysis that measured the metabolic activity for each subject in preselected regions located in the temporal insula. Subjects with bradycardia had significantly higher metabolic activity in the right (p < 0.0001) and in the left temporal insula (p < 0.015) than those with normal heart rates. Moreover, resting heart rates were negatively correlated with metabolism in the right (r = -0.77, p < 0.0001) and in the left temporal insula (r = -0.44, p < 0.05). These results corroborate the importance of the temporal insula in the regulation of resting heart rate in humans.

The plasma input function was determined from arterial blood samples with metabolite measurements by extraction in ethyl acetate. The preblocking studies showed that a two-tissue compartment model was necessary to fit the time activity curves of all brain regions including the cerebellum--in other words, the need for two compartments is not proof of specific binding. Therefore, a three-tissue compartment model was used to analyze the control studies, with three parameters fixed based on the preblocking data. Reliable fits of control data could be obtained only if no more than three parameters were allowed to vary. For routine use of [11C]MDL 100,907, several simplified methods were evaluated. A two-tissue (2T') compartment with one fixed parameter was the most reliable compartmental approach; a one-compartment model failed to fit the data adequately. The Logan graphical approach was also tested and produced comparable results to the 2T' model. However, a simulation study showed that Logan analysis produced a larger bias at higher noise levels.

The chronic SMP state was associated with a widely spread prefrontal hyperactivity, increased anterior cingulate activity and decreased activity in the thalamus contralateral to the body side suffering from SMP, but was unrelated to sensorimotor activity. Ineffective sympathetic blocks, i.e. blocks that did not diminish the SMP pain, did not change the cortical responses to the painful thermal stimulus; while effective placebo resulted in similar responses to those of effective blocks.

METHODS: In nine patients implanted for treatment of intractable depression, a Macintosh computer was used to detect the signal from the implanted VNS stimulator and then to synchronize fMRI image acquisition with its regular firing. RESULTS: With our VNS-fMRI methodology, the blood oxygenation level-dependent response to VNS was shown in brain regions regulated by the vagus nerve: orbitofrontal and parieto-occipital cortex bilaterally, left temporal cortex, the hypothalamus, and the left amygdala.

Subjects tracked a continuously moving target with a joystick-controlled cursor. The target moved in a repeating sequence embedded within random movements to block sequence awareness. Psychophysical studies of behavioral transfer from incompatible (joystick and cursor moving in opposite directions) to compatible tracking established that incompatible learning was occurring with respect to target location.

Incompatible learning also led to increasing activity in the precentral gyrus, maximal in the putative frontal eye fields. When the incompatible task was switched to a compatible response and the previously learned sequence was reintroduced, there was an increase in arm motor cortex. The results show that learning-related increases of brain activity are dynamic, with recruitment of multiple motor output areas, contingent on task demands.

The oxygen extraction fraction was higher (0.49 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.12; P = 0.017) and blood transit time longer (0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 min; P = 0.04) in the exercising muscle of the trained compared with the untrained subjects. The flow heterogeneity by means of relative dispersion was lower for the exercising muscle in the trained (50 +/- 9%) compared with the untrained subjects (65 +/- 13%, P = 0.025). In conclusion, oxygen extraction is higher, blood transit time longer, and perfusion more homogeneous in endurance-trained subjects compared with untrained subjects at the same workload. These changes may be associated with improved exercise efficiency in the endurance-trained subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11350784,N,no corr,,,

Blood flow was measured with 0-15-butanol, continuous arterial blood sampling, and positron emission tomography (PET). Global flow changes surpassed the published values of O-15-H2O studies, better fitting the results of the inert gas technique (gCBF at 20, 40, and 70 mm Hg PETCO2 +/- SD was 31 +/- 4, 48 +/- 13, and 160 +/- 50 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1), respectively). The relation between PETCO2 and CBF in the current study was best described by an exponential rather than a linear function. At low PETCO2, the activation-induced flow changes are moderately damped, whereas at high PETCO2, they are nearly lost (deltaCBF (+/-SD): 52% +/- 25%, 68% +/- 22%, 16% +/- 25% at PETCO2 = 20, 40, 70 mm Hg, respectively).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11488535,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: Water O 15 positron emission tomography (PET) studies were used to localize alterations in synaptic activity related to cue-induced drug craving in 8 crack cocaine-dependent African American men. In a novel approach, script-guided imagery of autobiographical memories were used as individualized cues to internally generate a cocaine craving state and 2 control (ie, anger and neutral episodic memory recall) states during PET image acquisition. RESULTS: The mental imagery of personalized drug use and anger-related scripts was associated with self-ratings of robust drug craving or anger, and comparable alterations in heart rate. Compared with the neutral imagery control condition, imagery-induced drug craving was associated with bilateral (right hemisphere amygdala activation greater than left) activation of the amygdala, the left insula and anterior cingulate gyrus, and the right subcallosal gyrus and nucleus accumbens area. Compared with the anger control condition, internally generated drug craving was associated with bilateral activation of the insula and subcallosal cortex, left hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex and brainstem. A brain-wide pixel-by-pixel search indicated significant positive and negative correlations between imagery-induced cocaine craving and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in distributed sites. CONCLUSIONS: The collected findings suggest the craving-related activation of a network of limbic, paralimbic, and striatal brain regions, including structures involved in stimulus-reward association (amygdala), incentive motivation (subcallosal gyrus/nucleus accumbens), and anticipation (anterior cingulate cortex).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11296093,N,clinical,,,

Motivated by these findings, we examined in opiate addicts whether brain regions involved in the reward circuitry also react to human prototypical rewards. We measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) during a visuo-spatial recognition task with delayed response in control subjects and in opiate addicts participating in a methadone program. Three conditions were defined by the types of feedback: nonsense feedback; nonmonetary reinforcement; or monetary reward, received by the subjects for a correct response. We found in the control subjects rCBF increases in regions associated with the meso-striatal and meso-corticolimbic circuits in response to both monetary reward and nonmonetary reinforcement. In opiate addicts, these regions were activated only in response to monetary reward. Furthermore, nonmonetary reinforcement elicited rCBF increases in limbic regions of the opiate addicts that were not activated in the control subjects. Because psychoactive drugs serve as rewards and directly affect regions of the dopaminergic system like the striatum, we conclude that the differences in rCBF increases between controls and addicts can be attributed to an adaptive consequence of the addiction process.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11703464,N,no corr with phys,,,

In several peripherally challenged rodent models of scrapie, spread of infectious agent to the brain and spinal cord shows a pattern consistent with propagation along nerves supplying the viscera. We used immunocytochemistry (ICC) and paraffin-embedded tissue (PET) blotting to identify the location and temporal sequence of pathological accumulation of a host protein, PrP, in the CNS, PNS, and ENS of hamsters orally infected with the 263K scrapie strain. Enteric ganglia and components of splanchnic and vagus nerve circuitry were examined along with the brain and spinal cord. Bioassays were carried out with selected PNS constituents. Deposition of pathological PrP detected by ICC was consistent with immunostaining of a partially protease-resistant form of PrP (PrP(Sc)) in PET blots. PrP(Sc) could be observed from approximately one-third of the way through the incubation period in enteric ganglia and autonomic ganglia of splanchnic or vagus circuitry prior to sensory ganglia. PrP(Sc) accumulated, in a defined temporal sequence, in sites that accurately reflected known autonomic and sensory relays. Scrapie agent infectivity was present in the PNS at low or moderate levels.

Eight subjects had three resting scans followed by their script and additional scans. Heart rate responses as well as the presence of flashbacks and their intensity were recorded. rCBF was correlated with flashback intensity in each subject's scan.

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in the striatum and extrastriatal region in association with walking exercise in six normal subjects and seven age-matched unmedicated patients with Parkinson's disease. This was done by comparing DAT radioligand uptake in the dopaminergic projection areas after gait with that under the resting condition using a DAT probe, 11C-labelled 2-beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane ([11C]CFT) and PET. Physiological parameters were stable during and after gait in both groups. The regions of interest method for measuring differences in [11C]CFT uptake level and voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) showed that [11C]CFT uptake in the striatum (specifically the putamen) was decreased by gait to a greater extent in normal subjects, whereas a significant reduction in [11C]CFT uptake was not found in the putamen but in the caudate and orbitofrontal cortex in Parkinson's disease patients. These results are the first in vivo evidence that DAT availability is reduced in the nigrostriatal projection area by basic human behaviour, i.e. gait. Alterations in this availability in Parkinson's disease suggested that shifted activation in the medial striatum and the mesocortical dopaminergic system might reflect the pathophysiology of parkinsonian gait.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11287377,N,no corr with phys,,,

METHODS: PET with [15O]H2O and arterial blood sampling were performed on eight middle-aged healthy volunteers while they were sitting passively or standing actively. Absolute rCBF values estimated by the autoradiographic method in regions of interest were compared using ANOVA, and relative changes in rCBF were also analyzed voxel by voxel using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). RESULTS: Physiologic data remained unchanged for different conditions. ANOVA and SPM showed that absolute and relative rCBF levels were significantly elevated in the cerebellar vermis in the standing position compared with those in the supine and sitting positions. In contrast, ANOVA showed that rCBF in the frontal and parietal cortices tended to be lower in the sitting and standing positions than in the supine position. Regression analysis showed that the frontal rCBF measured during standing tended to be inversely correlated with age. CONCLUSION: The results showed that cerebellar vermis activation was more marked in the standing position than in the sitting or supine positions, indicating that the vermis is a neural substrate for controlling voluntary upright posture.

The present study assessed cerebellar responses when the urge to breathe is stimulated by inhaled CO(2). Ventilation changes follow arterial blood partial pressure CO(2) changes sensed by the medullary ventral respiratory group (VRG) and hypothalamus, entraining changes in midbrain, pons, thalamus, limbic, paralimbic, and insular regions. Nearly all these areas are known to connect anatomically with the cerebellum. Using positron emission tomography, we measured regional brain blood flow during acute CO(2)-induced breathlessness in humans. Separable physiological and subjective effects (air hunger) were assessed by comparisons with various respiratory control conditions. The conjoint physiological effects of hypercapnia and the consequent air hunger produced strong bilateral, near-midline activations of the cerebellum in anterior quadrangular, central, and lingula lobules, and in many areas of posterior quadrangular, tonsil, biventer, declive, and inferior semilunar lobules. The primal emotion of air hunger, dissociated from hypercapnia, activated midline regions of the central lobule. The distributed activity across the cerebellum is similar to that for thirst, hunger, and their satiation. Four possible interpretations of cerebellar function(s) here are that: it subserves implicit intentions to access air; it provides predictive internal models about the consequences of CO(2) inhalation; it modulates emotional responses; and that while some cerebellar regions monitor sensory acquisition in the VRG (CO(2) concentration), others influence VRG to adjust respiratory rate to optimize partial pressure CO(2), and others still monitor and optimize the acquisition of other sensory data in service of air hunger aroused vigilance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11172072,N,co2,,,

We performed a functional imaging study with positron emission tomography (PET) to assess brain activation associated with an important component of dyspnea, respiratory discomfort during loaded breathing. We induced respiratory discomfort in eight healthy volunteers by adding external resistive loads during inspiration and expiration. Brain activation was characterized by a significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) (Z score of peak activation > 3.09). As compared with the unloaded control condition, high loaded breathing was associated with neural activation in three distinct brain regions, the right anterior insula, the cerebellar vermis, and the medial pons (respective Z scores = 4.75, 4.44, 4.41). For these brain regions, we further identified a positive correlation between rCBF and the perceived intensity of respiratory discomfort (respective Z scores = 4.45, 4.75, 4.74) as well as between rCBF and the mean amplitude of mouth pressure swings (DeltaPm), the index of the main generating mechanism of the sensation (respective Z scores = 4.67, 4.36, 4.31), suggesting a common activation by these two parameters. Furthermore, we identified an area in the right posterior cingulate cortex where neural activation was specifically associated with perceived intensity of respiratory discomfort that is not related to DeltaPm (Z score = 4.25). Our results suggest that respiratory discomfort related to loaded breathing may be subserved by two distinct neural networks, the first being involved in the concomitant processing of the genesis and perception of respiratory discomfort and the second in the modulation of perceived intensity of the sensation by various factors other than its main generating mechanism, which may include emotional processing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11282772,N,no phys of interest,,,

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), activation of the left amygdala was observed in response to threat versus safe conditions, which correlated with the expression of the fear response as measured by skin conductance. Additional activation observed in the insular cortex is proposed to be involved in conveying a cortical representation of fear to the amygdala.

Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), we compared activation responses to noxious thermal stimulation while perceived pain intensity was manipulated by changes in either physical intensity or induced anxiety. One visual signal, which reliably predicted noxious stimulation of moderate intensity, came to evoke low anxiety about the impending pain. Another visual signal was followed by the same, moderate-intensity stimulation on most of the trials, but occasionally by discriminably stronger noxious stimuli, and came to evoke higher anxiety. We found that the entorhinal cortex of the hippocampal formation responded differentially to identical noxious stimuli, dependent on whether the perceived pain intensity was enhanced by pain-relevant anxiety. During this emotional pain modulation, entorhinal responses predicted activity in closely connected, affective (perigenual cingulate), and intensity coding (mid-insula) areas. Our finding suggests that accurate preparatory information during medical and dental procedures alleviates pain by disengaging the hippocampus.

The authors undertook this study to provide further information on the changes in whole-brain and periclot regional CBF that occur with pharmacologic reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in patients with acute ICH. METHODS: Fourteen patients with acute supratentorial ICH 1 to 45 mL in size were studied 6 to 22 hours after onset. CBF was measured with PET and (15)O-water. After completion of the first CBF measurement, patients were randomized to receive either nicardipine or labetalol to reduce MAP by 15%, and the CBF study was repeated. RESULTS: MAP was lowered by -16.7 +/- 5.4% from 143 +/- 10 to 119 +/- 11 mm Hg. There was no significant change in either global CBF or periclot CBF. Calculation of the 95% CI demonstrated that there is less than a 5% chance that global or periclot CBF fell by more than -2.7 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1).

A new, selective dopamine-1 agonist, fenoldopam, is a potent systemic vasodilator with moderate alpha(2)-receptor affinity. However, the effects of fenoldopam on the cerebral circulation are undefined. We therefore hypothesized that infusion of fenoldopam would decrease mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and might concurrently decrease CBF via vascular alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor activation in awake volunteers. We studied nine healthy normotensive subjects, using positron emission tomography to measure CBF in multiple cortical and subcortical regions of interest. In addition, bioimpedance cardiac output and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity were determined during fenoldopam-induced hypotension. Three men and four women, aged 25-43 yr, completed the study. Fenoldopam infused at 1.3 +/- 0.4 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) (mean +/- SD) reduced MAP 16% from baseline: from 94 (89-100) mm Hg (mean [95% confidence interval]) to 79 [74-85] mm Hg (P < 0.0001). During the fenoldopam infusion, both cardiac output (+39%), and heart rate (+45%) increased significantly, whereas global CBF decreased from baseline, 45.6 [35.6-58.5] mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1), to 37.7 [33.9-42.0] mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1) (P < 0.0001).

Changes in middle cerebral artery velocity did not correlate with positron emission tomography-measured changes of CBF induced by fenoldopam, with or without concurrent phenylephrine. IMPLICATIONS: In awake volunteers with (presumably) intact cerebral autoregulation,fenoldopam-induced hypotension significantly decreased global cerebral bloodflow (CBF). Clinicians should be aware of these pharmacodynamic effects when choosing a vasodilator to control blood pressure, especially in situations where control of CBF, cerebral blood volume, and intracranial pressure are therapeutic priorities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11429337,N,no corr with phys,,,

Transient anxiety was induced in normal subjects by having them anticipate a painful shock to the fingers of one hand. BF was decreased during anticipatory anxiety, relative to an eyes-closed resting condition, in two regions of the MPFC (Brodmann Areas 10/32 and 24/25). BF decreases in these areas were inversely correlated with anxiety self rating, such that the least anxious subjects exhibited the largest BF reductions, whereas the most anxious subjects showed no significant BF reduction or a slight increase. BF changes in MPFC and in the midbrain were correlated with each other and with anxiety self rating. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that BF reductions in MPFC, previously observed in cognitive tasks, reflect a dynamic balance between focused attention and subject anxiety and may occur from a functionally active baseline or default state. The characterization of such relationships within the human brain enables new insights into the integration of cognition and emotion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11209066,N,no phys of interest,,,

Thus, the sensory stimulus and act (eating) were held constant while the reward value of the chocolate and motivation of the subject to eat were manipulated by feeding. Non-specific effects of satiety (such as feelings of fullness and autonomic changes) were also present and probably contributed to the modulation of brain activity. After eating each piece of chocolate, subjects gave ratings of how pleasant/unpleasant the chocolate was and of how much they did or did not want another piece of chocolate. Regional cerebral blood flow was then regressed against subjects' ratings. Different groups of structures were recruited selectively depending on whether subjects were eating chocolate when they were highly motivated to eat and rated the chocolate as very pleasant [subcallosal region, caudomedial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula/operculum, striatum and midbrain] or whether they ate chocolate despite being satiated (parahippocampal gyrus, caudolateral OFC and prefrontal regions). As predicted, modulation was observed in cortical chemosensory areas, including the insula and caudomedial and caudolateral OFC, suggesting that the reward value of food is represented here. Of particular interest, the medial and lateral caudal OFC showed opposite patterns of activity. This pattern of activity indicates that there may be a functional segregation of the neural representation of reward and punishment within this region. The only brain region that was active during both positive and negative compared with neutral conditions was the posterior cingulate cortex. Therefore, these results support the hypothesis that there are two separate motivational systems: one orchestrating approach and another avoidance behaviours.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11522575,N,no corr with phys,,,

Therefore, we evaluated a new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, NS2456, to determine whether it is suited for use in PET. Racemic NS2456 [(1RS,5SR)-8-methyl-3-[4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl]-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1]oct-2-ene] and its N-demethylated analog, racemic NS2463, selectively inhibited serotonin uptake in rat brain synaptosomes; their IC(50) values were 3000-fold lower for [(3)H]serotonin than for either [(3)H]dopamine or [(3)H]noradrenaline. The enantiomers of NS2463 were also potent inhibitors of serotonin uptake in vitro, but they failed to show stereoselectivity. Racemic NS2463 as well as its enantiomers were radiolabelled by N-methylation with C-11, yielding [(11)C]NS2456 for use in PET of the living porcine brain. The compounds crossed the blood-brain barrier rapidly and accumulated preferentially in regions rich in serotonin uptake sites (e.g., brainstem, subthalamus and thalamus). However, their binding potentials were relatively low and no stereoselectivity was found. Thus, neither racemic [(11)C]NS2456 nor its [(11)C]-labelled enantiomers are ideal for PET neuroimaging of neuronal serotonin uptake sites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11323236,N,ssri study,,,

PET measures of 5-HT2A receptors were obtained under an equilibrium paradigm, with a 40-min PET acquisition starting approximately at 300 min (308+/-11 min) after bolus plus constant infusion of the radiotracer. Three brain outcome measures were obtained at equilibrium, V(3) (ratio of specific brain uptake to free parent plasma concentration of radiotracer), V(3)' (ratio of specific brain uptake to total parent plasma concentration) and RT (ratio of specific to non-displaceable brain uptakes). V(3)' and RT had high test/retest reproducibility, as measured by mean intra-subject% change for cortical brain areas of 14.1 and 11.0%, respectively. They also had high reliability, as measured by mean intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for cortical brain areas of 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. V(3) had low test/retest reproducibility, due to high variability in the measures of free parent tracer in plasma. This study supports the feasibility of equilibrium imaging of 5-HT2A receptors with PET and [18F]deuteroaltanserin. The equilibrium imaging method with [18F]deuteroaltanserin allows a single acquisition and blood measurement to provide an image whose pixel values equal a receptor volume of distribution. Since the single image pixel values are proportional to receptor densities, the images can be used in pixel-by-pixel statistical methods, such as SPM, to assess the distribution and density of 5-HT2A receptors in neuropsychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11306248,N,no corr,,,

The aim of this study was to examine brain activity during symptom provocation in social phobics. METHOD: Positron emission tomography with the use of (15)O water was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 18 subjects with DSM-IV-defined social phobia and a nonphobic comparison group while they were speaking in front of an audience and in private. Heart rate and subjective anxiety were also recorded. RESULTS: During public versus private speaking, subjective anxiety increased more in the social phobics than in the comparison group. Increased anxiety was accompanied by enhanced rCBF in the amygdaloid complex in the social phobics relative to the comparison subjects. Cortically, brain blood flow decreased in the social phobics and increased in the comparison subjects more during public than private speaking in the orbitofrontal and insular cortices as well as in the temporal pole and increased less in the social phobics than in the comparison group in the parietal and secondary visual cortices. Furthermore, rCBF increased in the comparison group, but not in the social phobics, in the perirhinal and retrosplenial cortices. CONCLUSIONS: An rCBF pattern of relatively increased cortical rather than subcortical perfusion was observed in the nonphobic subjects, indicating that cortical evaluative processes were taxed by public performance. In contrast, the social phobia symptom profile was associated with increased subcortical activity. Thus, the functional neuroanatomy of social phobia involves the activation of a phylogenetically older danger-recognition system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481154,N,no corr,,,

Lesion evidence suggests that the subjective experience of fear relies upon amygdala-medial frontal activity (as well as autonomic arousal), whereas the factual context of threat stimuli depends upon hippocampal-lateral frontal activity. This amygdala-hippocampus dissociation has not previously been demonstrated in vivo. To explore this differentiation, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) measures of phasic arousal, while subjects viewed fearful versus neutral faces. fMRI activity was subaveraged according to whether or not the subject evoked an arousal SCR to each discrete face stimulus. The fMRI-with arousal and fMRI-without arousal data provided a distinct differentiation of amygdala and hippocampal networks. Amygdala-medial frontal activity was observed only with SCRs, whereas hippocampus-lateral frontal activity occurred only in the absence of SCRs. The findings provide direct evidence for a dissociation between human amygdala and hippocampus networks in the visceral experience versus declarative fact processing of fear.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11697938,Y,rand,corr,,

Six healthy volunteers (4 women, 2 men) screened for high hypnotizability were studied on 3 separate days during constant-load exercise under three hypnotic conditions involving cycling on a 1) perceived level grade, 2) perceived downhill grade, and 3) perceived uphill grade. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distributions for several sites were compared across conditions using an analysis of variance. The suggestion of downhill cycling decreased both the RPE [from 13 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 (SD) units; P < 0.05] and rCBF in the left insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, but it did not alter exercise HR or BP responses. Perceived uphill cycling elicited significant increases in RPE (from 13 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 1 units), HR (+16 beats/min), mean BP (+7 mmHg), right insular activation (+7.7 +/- 4%), and right thalamus activation (+9.2 +/- 5%). There were no differences in rCBF for leg sensorimotor regions across conditions. These findings show that an increase in effort sense during constant-load exercise can activate both insular and thalamic regions and elevate cardiovascular responses but that decreases in effort sense do not reduce cardiovascular responses below the level required to sustain metabolic needs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11247939,N,no corr,,,

Our aim was to study the kinetics, biodistribution, stability, dosimetry, and safety of [(18)F]FHBG in healthy human volunteers, preparatory to imaging patients undergoing HSV1-tk gene therapy. METHODS: [(18)F]FHBG was synthesized with a specific activity of 37,000--444,000 GBq/mmol and a radiochemical purity > 99%. Ten healthy volunteers consented to participate in the study. A transmission scan was obtained before bolus injection of 70.3--229.4 MBq [(18)F]FHBG into a hand vein, followed by dynamic PET imaging with 4 consecutive emission scans. Warmed hand-vein blood was withdrawn at various times after injection for blood time--activity measurements. Electrocardiography, blood pressure, and blood and urine pharmacologic parameters were measured before and after injection of the [(18)F]FHBG tracer (n = 5). The stability of [(18)F]FHBG in the urine was analyzed. Attenuation-corrected images were reconstructed using the ordered-subsets expectation maximization algorithm. Image region-of-interest time-activity data were used with the MIRD program to estimate absorbed radiation dosages. RESULTS: [(18)F]FHBG had rapid blood clearance; only 8.42% +/- 4.76% (mean +/- SD) of the peak blood activity remained at approximately 30 min. The average ratio of plasma activity to whole-blood activity during the study was 0.91 +/- 0.04. Penetration of [(18)F]FHBG across the blood-brain barrier was not observed. The primary routes of clearance were renal and hepatobiliary. High activities were observed in the bladder, gut, liver, and kidneys, but <0.0002% of the injected dose per gram was observed in other tissues. In the urine, 83% of activity 180 min after injection was stable [(18)F]FHBG. Blood and urine pharmacologic parameters did not change significantly after injection of the [(18)F]FHBG tracer. The bladder absorbed the highest radiation dose. CONCLUSION: [(18)F]FHBG has the desirable in vivo characteristics of stability, rapid blood clearance, low background signal, biosafety, and acceptable radiation dosimetry in humans.

Periclot CBF, CMRO2, and OEF were determined in a 1-cm-wide area around the clot. In the 16 patients without midline shift, periclot data were compared with mirror contralateral regions.

Both periclot CBF and CMRO2 were significantly reduced compared with contralateral values (CBF: 20.9 +/- 7.6 vs. 37.0 +/- 13.9 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1), P = 0.0004; CMRO2: 1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.9 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1), P = 0.00001).

We determined the effect of Alos on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the absence and presence of rectal or sigmoid stimulation to evaluate 2 hypothesized mechanisms of therapeutic action: peripheral antinociception and inhibition of emotional motor system (EMS) regions in the brain. METHODS: Forty-nine nonconstipated irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (26 female) received H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans before a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-week trial with Alos (1-4 mg twice daily). PET scans were repeated after treatment in 37 completers. We assessed rCBF during baseline, rectal distention, and anticipation of undelivered rectal distention. The 3 conditions were repeated after a series of noxious sigmoid distentions. Rectal (45 mm Hg) and sigmoid (60 mm Hg) distentions were performed with a computer-controlled barostat device. RESULTS: Alos treatment, as compared with placebo, improved IBS symptoms and reduced rCBF in 5-HT3R containing regions of the EMS, but not in areas activated by pain. Reduction of rCBF appeared greatest in the absence of visceral stimulation, and was partially reversed by rectal or sigmoid distention. Symptom improvement across sessions was significantly correlated with rCBF decreases in the 5-HT3R-rich amygdala, ventral striatum, and dorsal pons. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in IBS symptoms correlated with a drug-induced reduction in the activity of central autonomic networks mediating emotional expression that was maximal in the absence of nociceptive input.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12360456,N,clinical,,,

Subcortical structures are substantially involved in different processes that are closely linked to pain processing, e.g. motor preparation, autonomic responses, affective components and learning. However, it is unclear to which extent nociceptive information is relayed to and processed in subcortical structures. We used single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify subcortical regions displaying hemodynamic responses to painful stimulation. Thulium-YAG (yttrium-aluminum-granate) laser evoked pain stimuli, which have no concomitant tactile component, were applied to either hand of healthy volunteers in a randomized order. This procedure allowed identification of areas displaying differential fMRI responses to right- and left-sided stimuli. Hippocampal complex, amygdala, red nucleus, brainstem and cerebellum were activated in response to painful stimuli. Structures related to the affective processing of pain showed bilateral activation, whereas structures involved in the generation of withdrawal behavior, namely red nucleus, putamen and cerebellum displayed differential (i.e. asymmetric) responses according to the side of stimulation. This suggests that spatial information about the nociceptive stimulus is made available in these structures for the guidance of defensive and withdrawal behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12237210,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: In this study regional changes in the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose were determined with positron emission tomography in response to cardiovascular-respiratory activation induced in healthy humans by beta-adrenergic stimulation produced with intravenous isoproterenol, which acts predominantly in the periphery because of minimal transport across the blood-brain barrier. RESULTS: Interoceptive activation raised heart rate to approximately 120 beats per minute, produced somatic and to a lesser extent psychological symptoms, and significantly increased cerebral glucose metabolism in the left primary somatosensory cortex and medial portion of the cingulate gyrus; right insular cortex showed a trend toward an increase that was significant in homogeneous subgroups of right-handed or female subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the involvement of specific brain regions as well as hemispheric laterality of function in visceral perception, and they suggest that during emotional reactions involving changes in visceral organ function, activation of some of the brain regions observed could be due specifically to interoceptive processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461189,N,no corr,,,

On the basis of both their clinical presentation and their magnetic resonance imaging pattern, patients with IDCA can be subdivided into patients with a purely cerebellar syndrome and atrophy of the cerebellum (IDCA-C) and patients with additional noncerebellar symptoms and atrophy of both cerebellum and brainstem (IDCA-P). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the disaggregated contribution of brainstem and cerebellum in the control of eye movements, by means of an extensive battery of quantitative tests covering most oculomotor subfunctions related to lesions of the cerebellum and the brainstem. The smooth-pursuit movement analysis showed a decrease in gain and magnitude in both subgroups of IDCA with respect to normal controls, without any significant differences in the prevalence pattern between the two subgroups; the mean values of these parameters, however, were significantly lower in IDCA-P than in IDCA-C subjects in both gain (P < 0.01) and magnitude (P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was observed between the two subgroups in the analysis of saccadic movements or in the other parameters investigated. The distinction between IDCA-P and IDCA-C subgroups has clinical implications, as a poorer prognosis is related to brainstem involvement, which may occur late in the course of the disease. Thus, the possibility to detect the brainstem involvement, also in association with cerebellar impairment, by a relatively simple eye-movement analysis, potentially useful mainly in follow-up investigations, needs to be evaluated further.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11903106,N,no phys of interest,,,

Thus, the hemodynamic response to visual stimulation was measured using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human subjects in a 7-T magnetic field under different basal conditions: hypocapnia, normocapnia, and hypercapnia. Hypercapnia was induced by inhalation of a 5% carbon dioxide gas mixture and hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilation. As the fMRI baseline signal increased linearly with expired CO2 from hypocapnic to hypercapnic levels, the magnitude of the BOLD response to visual stimulation decreased linearly. Measures of the dynamics of the visually evoked BOLD response (onset time, full-width-at-half-maximum, and time-to-peak) increased linearly with the basal fMRI signal and the end-tidal CO2 level. The basal CBF level, modulated by the arterial partial pressure of CO2, significantly affects both the magnitude and dynamics of the BOLD response induced by neural activity.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore neural mechanisms contributing to integration of volitional intent, self-representation, and autonomic states of arousal, embodied within performance of a biofeedback relaxation exercise. Data were obtained from 17 subjects to assess brain activity during relaxation in which a visual index of electrodermal arousal was modulated by accuracy (addition of random ""noise"") or sensitivity (by scalar adjustments of feedback). A central matrix of cortical, subcortical and brainstem autonomic centres was activated during biofeedback relaxation, as well as regions that mediate visual and somatesthetic representations and executive control. Anterior cingulate, amygdala, and insula activity was modulated by task manipulations that increased demand on processing interoceptive representations, while variation in anterior insula activity reflected an interaction between accuracy and sensitivity of feedback.

METHODS: Pressure was applied to the left thumbnail beds of 16 right-handed patients with FM and 16 right-handed matched controls. Each FM patient underwent fMRI while moderately painful pressure was being applied. The functional activation patterns in FM patients were compared with those in controls, who were tested under 2 conditions: the ""stimulus pressure control"" condition, during which they received an amount of pressure similar to that delivered to patients, and the ""subjective pain control"" condition, during which the intensity of stimulation was increased to deliver a subjective level of pain similar to that experienced by patients. RESULTS: Stimulation with adequate pressure to cause similar pain in both groups resulted in 19 regions of increased regional cerebral blood flow in healthy controls and 12 significant regions in patients. Increased fMRI signal occurred in 7 regions common to both groups, and decreased signal was observed in 1 common region. In contrast, stimulation of controls with the same amount of pressure that caused pain in patients resulted in only 2 regions of increased signal, neither of which coincided with a region of activation in patients. Statistical comparison of the patient and control groups receiving similar stimulus pressures revealed 13 regions of greater activation in the patient group. In contrast, similar stimulus pressures produced only 1 region of greater activation in the control group. CONCLUSION: The fact that comparable subjectively painful conditions resulted in activation patterns that were similar in patients and controls, whereas similar pressures resulted in no common regions of activation and greater effects in patients, supports the hypothesis that FM is characterized by cortical or subcortical augmentation of pain processing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12115241,N,no phys of interest,,,

It is still not clear whether the drug has a direct and specific effect on neurotransmission or its effects are due to extracerebral actions, such as changes in cerebral blood flow. The main objective of the present investigation was to determine the global uptake and regional distribution of radiolabelled vinpocetine in the human brain in order to explore whether it may have direct central nervous system effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three healthy subjects were examined with positron emission tomography and [11C]vinpocetine. The regional uptake was determined in anatomically defined volumes-of-interest. The fractions of [11C]vinpocetine and labelled metabolites in plasma were determined using high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The uptake of [11C]vinpocetine in brain was rapid and 3.7% (mean; n = 4) of the total radioactivity injected was in brain 2 min after radioligand administration. The uptake was heterogeneously distributed among brain regions. When compared with the cerebellum, an a priori reference region, the highest regional uptake was in the thalamus, upper brain stem, striatum and cortex. Following an initial peak, the total concentration of radioactivity in blood was relatively stable with time, whereas the concentration of the unchanged compound decreased with time in an exponential manner. CONCLUSION: Vinpocetine, administered intravenously in humans, readily passes the blood-brain barrier and enters the brain. Its regional uptake and distribution in the brain is heterogeneous, indicating binding to specific sites. The brain regions showing increased uptake in the human brain correspond to those in which vinpocetine has been shown to induce elevated metabolism and blood flow. These observations support the hypothesis that vinpocetine has direct neuronal actions in the human brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12460136,N,no phys of interest,,,

The goal of this study was to validate the use of a new multiparameter sensor that measures brain tissue oxygenation and metabolism (Neurotrend) by comparing it with positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. METHODS: A Neurotrend sensor was inserted into the frontal region of the brain in 19 patients admitted to the neurointensive care unit. After a period of stabilization, the patients were transferred to the PET scanner suite where C15O, 15O2, and H2(15)O PET scans were obtained to facilitate calculation of regional cerebral blood volume, O2 metabolism, blood flow, and O2 extraction fraction (OEF). Patients were given hyperventilation therapy to decrease arterial CO2 by approximately 1 kPa (7.5 mm Hg) and the same sequence of PET scans was repeated. For each scanning sequence, end-capillary O2 tension (PvO2) was calculated from the OEF and compared with the reading of brain tissue O2 pressure (PbO2) provided by the sensor. In three patients the sensor was inserted into areas of contusion and these patients were eliminated from the analysis. In the subset of 16 patients in whom the sensor was placed in healthy brain, no correlation was found between the absolute values of PbO2 and PvO2 (r = 0.2, p = 0.29); however a significant correlation was obtained between the change in PbO2 (deltaPbO2) and the change in PvO2 (deltaPvO2) produced by hyperventilation in a 20-mm region of interest around the sensor (p = 0.78, p = 0.0035). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of correlation between the absolute values of PbO2 and PvO2 indicates that PbO2 cannot be used as a substitute for PvO2. Nevertheless, the positive correlation between deltaPbO2 and deltaPvO2 when the sensor had been inserted into healthy brain suggests that tissue PO2 monitoring may provide a useful tool to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions in brain injury.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11838800,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2002 Aug 8.","Increased symmetrical fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the cervical and thoracic spine region is well known and has been attributed to muscular uptake. The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate this FDG uptake pattern by means of co-registered positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, which allowed exact localisation of this uptake. Between April and November 2001, 638 consecutive patients referred for PET/CT were imaged on an in-line PET/CT system (GEMS). This system combines an advanced GE PET scanner and a multirow-detector computer tomograph (Lightspeed, GEMS). The examination included PET with FDG and one CT acquisition with 80 mA. For CT, the following parameters were used: 140 kV, 80 mA, reconstructed slice thickness 5 mm, scan length 867 mm, AT 22.5 s. CT data were used for attenuation correction as well as image co-registration. Image analysis was performed on an Entegra work-station (ELGEMS). All patients with symmetrical uptake within the neck, thorax and shoulder regions were selected and the exact localisation of uptake determined (muscle, bone, fatty tissue or articulation). In 17 of the 638 patients (2.5%), increased, symmetrical FDG uptake in the shoulder region in a typical pattern was found. If extensive, this pattern included FDG activity comparable to brain activity in the lower cervical spine, the shoulder region and the upper thoracic spine in the costovertebral region. A less extensive pattern only involved intermediate FDG uptake in the lower cervical spine and shoulder region or in the shoulder region alone. In seven female patients (average 32.3 years), the extensive uptake pattern was seen. The average body mass index (BMI) was 19.0 (range 16.8-23.4). In the other ten patients (two male, eight female, average age 37.1 years), the average BMI was 22.7 (18.7-27.7). In all patients, the soft tissue uptake was clearly localised within the fatty tissue of the shoulders as demonstrated by PET/CT co-registration. The uptake in the region of the thoracic spine was localised in the region of the costovertebral joints. Symmetrical FDG uptake in the shoulder, neck and thoracic spine region is probably related to uptake in adipose tissue, especially in underweight patients. Hypothetically, this FDG uptake could represent activated brown adipose tissue during increased sympathetic nerve system (SNS) activity due to cold stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12271425,N,spine study,,,

Neuroimaging studies have shown that the human amygdala responds not only to fearful and angry facial expressions but also to fearful and threatening scenes such as attacks, explosions, and mutilations. Given the relative importance of facial expressions in adaptive social behavior, we hypothesized that the human amygdala would exhibit a stronger response to angry and fearful facial expressions in comparison to other fearful and threatening stimuli. Twelve subjects completed two tasks while undergoing fMRI: matching angry or fearful facial expressions, and matching scenes depicting fearful or threatening situations derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). While there was an amygdala response to both facial expressions and IAPS stimuli, direct comparison revealed that the amygdala response to facial expressions was significantly greater than that to IAPS stimuli. Autonomic reactivity, measured by skin conductance responses, was also greater to facial expressions. These results suggest that the human amygdala shows a stronger response to affective facial expressions than to scenes, a bias that should be considered in the design of experimental paradigms interested in probing amygdala function.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12482086,N,no corr,,,

Regions of interest were examined for signal intensity changes over baseline and challenge conditions in cardiorespiratory-related regions. In addition, whole brain correlations between signal intensity and heart rate and airway load pressure were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Significant signal changes, correlated with the time course of load pressure and heart rate, emerged within multiple areas, including the amygdala and hippocampus, insular and lateral frontal cortices, dorsal pons, dorsal medulla, lentiform nucleus, and fastigial and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Signal intensities peaked early in the Valsalva maneuver within the hippocampus and amygdala, later within the dorsal medulla, pons and midbrain, and deep cerebellar nuclei, and last within the lentiform nuclei and the lateral prefrontal cortex. The ventral pontine signals increased during the challenge, but not in a fashion correlated to load pressure or heart rate.

METHODS: Studies are reported using psychophysiological or functional neuroimaging methodology. RESULTS: The psychophysiological study did not indicate a general emotional hyperresponsiveness in BPD. Low autonomic arousal seemed to reflect dissociative states in borderline subjects experiencing intense emotions.

There is no agreement on the mechanisms underlying this ventilatory response.

Relative rCBF contrasts between the loaded and unloaded breathing states showed significant activations in inferior parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex, midbrain, basal ganglia and multiple cerebellar sites. No activations were found in the primary sensorimotor cortex. The findings suggest that there is a pattern of motor behavioural response to the uncomfortable sensation that inspiration is impeded.

However, it decreases global cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to hyperventilation side effect of adenosine. In the present study, changes in regional CBF during dipyridamole stress were identified in detail. In 11 healthy men (51-71 years of age), CBF was measured by positron emission tomography with oxygen-15-labeled water at rest (baseline) and during dipyridamole stress. All images were normalized to global CBF and transformed to standard brain anatomy. A t map between baseline and dipyridamole stress conditions was then created on a pixel-by-pixel basis. CBF was globally decreased during dipyridamole stress. However, a significant relative increase in CBF was observed bilaterally in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex, indicating neural activation in these regions. Adenosine plays an important role in the production of anginal pain by stimulation of A(1) adenosine receptors. Neural activation in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex during angina pectoris has been reported. Although no subject felt chest pain during dipyridamole stress, neural activation in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex indicates that stimulation of A(1) adenosine receptors during dipyridamole stress may produce input from the heart to the thalamus through the vagal fiber.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12169262,M,prev analysis,,,

Our purpose was to use 1.5-T functional MR imaging (fMRI) to visualize the location of cranial nerve (CN) nuclei and other pontine, bulbar, and cervical spinal cord nuclei by using specific sensory stimulation or motor performance. METHODS: We localized nuclei by using cross-correlation analysis of regional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity during specific motor and sensory procedures based on known functions of specific nuclei. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was used for comparison. Head, cardiac, and respiratory motion artifact correction was applied. Histologic atlases aided localization. RESULTS: We obtained evidence of localization of the following nuclei by using tests, as follows: main trigeminal sensory (CN V), brushing the face; abducens (CN VI), left-right eye movement; facial (CN VII), smiling and lip puckering; hypoglossal (CN XII), pushing the tongue against the hard palate; nucleus ambiguus, swallowing; nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), tasting a sweet-sour-salty-bitter mixture; nucleus cuneatus, finger tapping; and cervical spinal cord levels C1-C3, tongue movement to activate the strap muscles. Activation of cortical motor and sensory areas and somatosensory thalamus corresponded with the tasks and sites of brainstem activation. Head movement was minimal, typically less than 1 mm in all three axes.

Pilot studies in our laboratory have shown that PTSD patients had very different responses to traumatic script-driven imagery. Approximately 70% of patients relived their traumatic experience and showed an increase in heart rate while recalling the traumatic memory. The other 30% of patients had a dissociative response with no concomitant increase in heart rate. This article focuses on the latter group. METHODS: The neuronal circuitry underlying dissociative responses in PTSD was studied using the traumatic script-driven symptom provocation paradigm adapted to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at a 4 Tesla field strength in 7 subjects with sexual-abuse-related PTSD and 10 control subjects. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, PTSD patients in a dissociative state showed more activation in the superior and middle temporal gyri (BA 38), the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47), the occipital lobe (BA 19), the parietal lobe (BA 7), the medial frontal gyrus (BA 10), the medial cortex (BA 9), and the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24 and 32).

PET studies have shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in epilepsy patients causes acute dose (intensity) dependent changes in regional cerebral blood flow. We sought to use the newly developed VNS synchronized fMRI technique to examine whether VNS BOLD signal changes depend on the frequency of stimulation. Six adults with recurrent depression were scanned inside a 1.5 T MR scanner. Data were acquired at rest, with the VNS device on for 7 s, and also, for comparison, while the patient listened to a tone for 7 s. In two separate back-to-back sessions, the VNS stimulation frequency was set to either 5 or 20 Hz. Data were transformed into Talairach space and then compared by condition. Compared to 5 Hz, 20 Hz VNS produced more acute activity changes from rest in regions similar to our initial VNS synchronized fMRI feasibility study in depression. Brain regions activated by hearing a tone were also greater when VNS was intermittently being applied at 20 Hz than at 5 Hz. In depressed adults, left cervical VNS causes regional brain activity changes that depend on the frequency of stimulation or total dose, or both. In addition to the acute immediate effects of VNS on regional brain activity, this study suggests further that VNS at different frequencies likely has frequency or dose dependent modulatory effects on other brain activities (e.g. hearing a tone).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12191626,N,no phys of interest,,,

End-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PET(CO2)) was gradually reduced during non-rapid eye movement sleep by increasing tidal volume with pressure support mechanical ventilation, causing a reduction in diaphragm electromyogram amplitude until apnea/periodic breathing occurred. We used the reduction in PET(CO2) below spontaneous breathing required to produce apnea (DeltaPET(CO2)) as an index of the susceptibility to apnea. DeltaPET(CO2) was -5 mm Hg in control animals and changed in proportion to background ventilatory drive, increasing with metabolic acidosis (-6.7 mm Hg) and nonhypoxic peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation (almitrine; -5.9 mm Hg) and decreasing with metabolic alkalosis (-3.7 mm Hg). Hypoxia was the exception; DeltaPET(CO2) narrowed (-4.1 mm Hg) despite the accompanying hyperventilation. Thus, hyperventilation and hypocapnia, per se, widened the DeltaPET(CO2) thereby protecting against apnea and hypopnea, whereas reduced ventilatory drive and hypoventilation narrowed the DeltaPET(CO2) and increased the susceptibility to apnea. Hypoxia sensitized the ventilatory responsiveness to CO2 below eupnea and narrowed the DeltaPET(CO2); this effect of hypoxia was not attributable to an imbalance between peripheral and central chemoreceptor stimulation, per se. We conclude that the DeltaPET(CO2) and the ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 between eupnea and the apneic threshold are changeable in the face of variations in the magnitude, direction, and/or type of ventilatory stimulus, thereby altering the susceptibility for apnea, hypopnea, and periodic breathing in sleep.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11991874,N,no corr,,,

Reduced rCBF was observed in temporal lobe auditory regions, in visual cortex, and in brain regions that may be part of an attentional network (parietal lobe, frontal lobe and thalamus).

Previous symptom provocation studies using brain imaging have involved Vietnam veterans. In this study neural correlates were investigated in patients with PTSD resulting from trauma in more recent war zones. (15)Oxygen water and positron emission tomography were used to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with war- and combat-related chronic PTSD during exposure to combat and neutral sounds. Self-reports and heart rate confirmed symptomatic responding during traumatic stimulation. The war-related condition, as compared to the neutral, increased rCBF in the right sensorimotor areas (Brodmann areas 4/6), extending into the primary sensory cortex (areas 1/2/3), and the cerebellar vermis. RCBF also increased in the right amygdala and in the periaqueductal gray matter adjacent to the pons.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study changes of activity of cortical nociceptive networks in healthy volunteers while they expected the somatosensory stimulation of one foot, which might be painful (subcutaneous injection of ascorbic acid) or not. Subjects had no previous experience of the noxious stimulus. Mean fMRI signal intensity increased over baseline values during anticipation and during actual stimulation in the putative foot representation area of the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Mean fMRI signals decreased during anticipation in other portions of the contralateral and ipsilateral SI, as well as in the anteroventral cingulate cortex. The activity of cortical clusters whose signal time courses showed positive or negative correlations with the individual psychophysical pain intensity curve was also significantly affected during the waiting period. Positively correlated clusters were found in the contralateral SI and bilaterally in the anterior cingulate, anterior insula, and medial prefrontal cortex. Negatively correlated clusters were found in the anteroventral cingulate bilaterally. In all of these areas, changes during anticipation were of the same sign as those observed during pain but less intense ( approximately 30-40% as large as peak changes during actual noxious stimulation). These results provide evidence for top-down mechanisms, triggered by anticipation, modulating cortical systems involved in sensory and affective components of pain even in the absence of actual noxious input and suggest that the activity of cortical nociceptive networks may be directly influenced by cognitive factors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11943821,N,no phys of interest,,,

There is little information on the effects of dexmedetomidine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) or intracranial hemodynamics, despite considerable other pharmacodynamic data. We hypothesized that therapeutic doses of dexmedetomidine would decrease CBF. Therefore, nine supine volunteers, aged 24-48 yr, were infused with a 1 micro g/kg IV loading dose of dexmedetomidine, followed by an infusion of 0.2 micro g. kg(-1). h(-1) (LOW DEX) and 0.6 micro g. kg(-1). h(-1) (HIGH DEX). Hemodynamic and CBF (via positron emission tomography) measurements were determined at each experimental time point. Dexmedetomidine decreased both cardiac output and heart rate during and 30 min after drug administration. Blood pressure decreased from 12% to 16% during and after the dexmedetomidine administration. Global CBF was decreased significantly from baseline (91 mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1) [95% confidence interval, 72-114] to 64 mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1) [51-81] LOW DEX and 61 mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1) [48-76] HIGH DEX). This decrease in CBF remained constant for at least 30 min after the dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued, despite the plasma dexmedetomidine concentration decreasing 40% during this same time period (628 pg/mL [524-732] to 380 pg/mL [253-507]). IMPLICATIONS: Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) by congruent with 33%, which could be due to direct alpha(2)-receptor cerebral smooth muscle vasoconstriction or to compensatory CBF changes caused by dexmedetomidine-induced decreases in the cerebral metabolic rate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12351293,N,no phys of interest,,,

Such restrictions have previously been ascribed solely to intravascular lesions. We postulate that flow could also be restricted by functional kinking in the arteries, and that surgical release of these kinks might be an effective treatment. METHODS: We prospectively studied 80 endurance athletes who had complaints suggestive of flow restriction in the iliac arteries of one (n=74) or both (6) legs (total 92 legs). Using vascular diagnostic tools, we examined athletes while they were doing activities that often provoke flow restrictions. Restrictions were determined by measurement of systolic pressure in the ankle after exercise; peak systolic velocities were measured with echo-doppler. Kinks were detected with echo-doppler and magnetic-resonance angiography. When functional kinking was diagnosed as the cause of the restriction, the athlete was offered surgery to release the iliac arteries, as part of our prospective study. FINDINGS: We recorded flow restrictions in the iliac arteries of 58 of 92 (63%) legs. In 40 of these legs (69%), kinks were the most important cause of the restriction, making these legs suitable for surgical release. We operated on 23 of 58 (40%) legs. All athletes who had an operation subjectively improved. Maximum workload in a cycling test and ankle pressure significantly improved after the operation. 20 (87%) athletes were able to successfully return to their desired high level of competition. INTERPRETATION: Our sports-specific protocol is effective in detecting kinking of the iliac arteries as a cause for flow restriction in athletes who have few intravascular abnormalities when investigated with conventional vascular diagnostic tools. Surgical treatment directed at the kinking was less invasive and therefore a better alternative to vascular reconstruction in these athletes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11853791,N,no brain data,,,

Among many, scintigraphic procedures have emerged as important diagnostic tools to assess extent, severity, and prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). For more than the last 30 years, however, the application of perfusion imaging has been extended to allow the combined evaluation of perfusion, perfusion reserve, and ventricular function. With positron emission tomography (PET), quantitative assessment of perfusion has become possible. In combination with pharmacological stress agents, the coronary flow reserve (CFR) can be quantitatively assessed as an early marker of endothelial dysfunction. PET in combination with metabolic tracers has added the evaluation of cardiac substrate metabolism, which has become an important clinical marker for ischemically jeopardized myocardium. The PET information is widely considered as the gold standard for tissue viability in the management of patients with advanced CAD and impaired left ventricular function (LVF). New tracer approaches include the assessment of cardiac innervation, which plays an increasingly recognized role in the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases. Radiolabeled catecholamine analogues provide visualization of sympathetic nerve terminals that are functionally altered in patients with diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy. In addition, this scintigraphic information allows the monitoring of physiological processes such as reinnervation of the transplanted heart. New methods, such as imaging of apoptosis and gene expression, are of interest in cardiology. Combining the therapeutic gene with a reporter gene, the transfection of cardiac tissue can be monitored noninvasively. First results employing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase reporter gene (HSV1-tk) are encouraging and represent an attractive approach for the use of PET imaging in the control of cardiac gene therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14537103,N,no brain data,,,

Subjects performed a CO2 rebreathe protocol that equilibrates CO2 partial pressures between arterial and venous blood and that elevates end tidal CO2 (PET(CO2)) from approximately 40 to approximately 58 mmHg. This test was repeated under conditions where end tidal oxygen levels were clamped at 50 (hypoxia) or 200 (hyperoxia) mmHg. Heart rate (HR; EKG), stroke volume (SV; Doppler ultrasound), blood pressure (MAP; finger plethysmograph), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were measured continuously during the two protocols. MAP at 40 mmHg PET(CO2) (i.e., the first minute of the rebreathe) was greater during hypoxia versus hyperoxia (P < 0.05). However, the increase in MAP during the rebreathe (P < 0.05) was similar in hypoxia (16 +/- 3 mmHg) and hyperoxia (17 +/- 2 mmHg PET(CO2)). The increase in cardiac output (Q) at 55 mmHg PET(CO2) was greater in hypoxia (2.61 +/- 0.7 L/min) versus hyperoxia (1.09 +/- 0.44 L/min) (P < 0.05). In both conditions the increase in Q was due to elevations in both HR and SV (P < 0.05). Systemic vascular conductance (SVC) increased to similar absolute levels in both conditions but rose earlier during hypoxia (> 50 mmHg PET(CO2)) than hyperoxia (> 55 mmHg). MSNA increased earlier during hypoxic hypercapnia (> 45 mmHg) compared with hyperoxic hypercapnia (> 55 mmHg). Thus, in these conscious humans, the dose-response effect of PET(CO2) on the integrated cardiovascular responses was shifted to the left during hypoxic hypercapnia. The combined data indicate that peripheral chemoreceptors exert important influence over cardiovascular reflex responses to hypercapnia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12564639,N,no brain data,,,

METHODS: Four patients with an implanted vagus nerve stimulator had fMRI images acquired during several cycles of intermittent VNS. Blood oxygen level dependent changes were detected. These regions were then superimposed upon the patients' structural MR images. RESULTS: Patients undergoing VNS tolerated fMRI without difficulty. No complications with the implanted stimulators were encountered. Areas of activation were noted in several cortical regions, including frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. CONCLUSION: Our study in four patients shows fMRI can be performed safely in patients with an implanted vagal nerve stimulator. The successful use of fMRI during VNS offers potential advantages over PET imaging by allowing rapid image acquisition and the ability to repeatedly study patients over time. Our preliminary results differ from previous PET or SPECT studies in failing to detect changes in subcortical areas.

Nine patients with diabetes (four men, five women; age 61 +/- 7 years) and painful peripheral neuropathy of the feet, but without evidence of generalized autonomic neuropathy, underwent intravenous infusion of tritiated norepinephrine (NE) and sampling of arterial and venous blood in both feet and in one arm to quantify the rate of entry of NE into the local venous plasma (NE spillover). In the same patients, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning after intravenous injection of the sympathoneural imaging agent 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine was used to visualize sympathetic innervation and after intravenous [(13)N]ammonia to visualize local perfusion. The results were compared with those in the feet of normal volunteers and in an unaffected foot of patients with unilateral complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In addition, neurochemical results obtained in painful diabetic neuropathy were compared with those obtained in diabetic control patients with painless neuropathy and diabetic control patients without neuropathy. Local arteriovenous difference in plasma NE levels (DeltaNE(AV)) and NE spillover in the arms did not differ across the groups. However, DeltaNE(AV) in the feet was significantly less in the group with painful diabetic neuropathy than in the control groups. Also NE spillover in the feet tended to be lower in painful neuropathy. DeltaNE(AV) of diabetic control patients without neuropathy (n = 6) resembled values in the control groups without diabetes, whereas patients with painless diabetic neuropathy (n = 6) had evidence suggesting partial loss of sympathetic innervation. PET scanning revealed decreased flow-corrected 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, compared with values in normal volunteers and patients with CRPS.

Elite rugby players (n = 17) took part in an 8 week study of exercise training of the knee extensor muscles, in which low-intensity [about 50% of one repetition maximum] exercise combined with an occlusion pressure of about 200 mmHg (LIO, n = 6), low-intensity exercise without the occlusion (LI, n = 6), and no exercise training (untrained control, n = 5) were included. The exercise in the LI group was of the same intensity and amount as in the LIO group. The LIO group showed a significantly larger increase in isokinetic knee extension torque than that in the other two groups (P < 0.05) at all the velocities studied. On the other hand, no significant difference was seen between LI and the control group. In the LIO group, the cross-sectional area of knee extensors increased significantly (P < 0.01), suggesting that the increase in knee extension strength was mainly caused by muscle hypertrophy. The dynamic endurance of knee extensors estimated from the decreases in mechanical work production and peak force after 50 repeated concentric contractions was also improved after LIO, whereas no significant change was observed in the LI and control groups.

Positron emission tomography and (15)O-water was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow in subjects with DSM-IV defined social phobia during anxiety anticipation. Heart rate and subjective anxiety were also recorded. While being scanned, subjects were speaking alone either before or after speaking in public. To evaluate anticipatory anxiety we compared individuals speaking alone before they were speaking in front of an audience with those who did the reverse. RESULTS: Heart rate and subjective anxiety measures confirmed anticipatory anxiety in social phobics who performed their private speech before their public. This was accompanied by enhanced cerebral blood flow in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left inferior temporal cortex, and in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region. Brain blood flow was lower in the left temporal pole and bilaterally in the cerebellum in the anticipation group. CONCLUSIONS: Brain regions with altered perfusion presumably reflect changes in neural activity associated with worry about anticipated public performance.

LHTLc and LHTLi slept 8-10 h/day overnight in normobaric hypoxia (approximately 2,650 m); Con slept under ambient conditions (600 m). Resting, isocapnic HVR (DeltaVE/DeltaSp(O(2)), where VE is minute ventilation and Sp(O(2)) is blood O(2) saturation) was measured in normoxia before hypoxia (Pre), after 1, 3, 10, and 15 nights of exposure (N1, N3, N10, and N15, respectively), and 2 nights after the exposure night 20 (Post). Before each HVR test, end-tidal PCO(2) (PET(CO(2))) and VE were measured during room air breathing at rest. HVR (l. min(-1). %(-1)) was higher (P < 0.05) in LHTLc than in Con at N1 (0.56 +/- 0.32 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.16), N3 (0.69 +/- 0.30 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.24), N10 (0.79 +/- 0.36 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.14), N15 (1.00 +/- 0.38 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.23), and Post (0.79 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.26).

No significant differences were observed for VE at any point.

METHODS: In 10 halothane-anesthetized cats, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded for 3 hours, followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) probes, microdialysis/high-performance liquid chromatography, and pressure sensors measured simultaneously regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), extracellular amino acids, mean arterial blood pressure, and intracranial pressure, respectively. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated. In complementary experiments (n=2), regional CBF was assessed by sequential positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion reduced LDF-measured CBF in all animals to <25% of control. In 5 of 10 cats, glutamate rose approximately 30-fold during ischemia. LDF-measured CBF and glutamate primarily recovered after reperfusion. Glutamate rose again in the late reperfusion phase, when CPP decreased to <60 mm Hg, and symptoms of transtentorial herniation were recognized. Positron emission tomography revealed ischemic thresholds of 15 to 20 mL/100 g per minute for secondary deterioration. In the other 5 cats, ischemic elevation of glutamate was significantly smaller, and signs of secondary deterioration were not recognized. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamate determinations during ischemia predict fatal outcome, as do intracranial pressure and CPP measurements during early reperfusion. Secondary amino acid elevation during reperfusion is presumably caused by a drastic decrease of CPP to <50 mm Hg in the final stage of space-occupying, malignant focal ischemia. At this stage, a further progression of injury due to increased glutamate may be irrelevant with respect to fatal outcome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11988619,N,animals,,,

These findings, together with decreasing regional ventilation and fractional gas content in the dependent regions, correlated with decreasing arterial Pa(O(2)) values over the course of the study.

Epub 2002 Nov 29.","Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has gained recognition as a treatment for refractory epilepsies where surgical treatment is not possible. While it appears that this treatment is effective in some patients, the mechanism of action is not clearly understood. The purpose of this study was to clarify findings of other positron emission tomography and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) investigations by measuring the acute effect of VNS on patients who have normal cerebral anatomy on magnetic resonance imaging and who have not previously been exposed to VNS. We investigated six subjects (two males and four females, mean age 29.5 years, range 21-39 years) with intractable epilepsy. One patient had primary generalised epilepsy causing generalised tonic-clonic seizures; the remaining five patients had localisation-related epilepsy causing complex partial seizures. SPET imaging was performed using 250 MBq of (99m)Tc-HMPAO and a four-scan paradigm - two with and two without stimulation. The stimulation began at VNS current levels of 0.25 mA and was increased according to the limit of patients' tolerance, usually defined by coughing or discomfort. The stimulating waveform was of continuous square wave pulses of 500 micro s duration at 30 Hz. Image analysis was by SPM99. Reduced perfusion during stimulation was observed in the ipsilateral brain stem, cingulate, amygdala and hippocampus and contralateral thalamus and cingulate. The study provides further evidence of the involvement of the limbic system in the action of vagal nerve stimulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12552350,N,spect,,,

Epub 2002 Nov 9.","Orthostatic hypotension (OH) can be present in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) as well as in atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA). According to clinical tests of sympathetic nerve function and histopathological data, OH is caused by primarily postganglionic sympathetic dysfunction in IPD and by predominantly central and preganglionic degeneration in MSA. It has been proposed that this concept of a different underlying pathogenesis for OH should be applied in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders, in the form of measurements of sympathetic myocardial innervation. In this pilot study, myocardial imaging with [ N-methyl (11)C]meta-hydroxyephedrine ((11)C-HED) and positron emission tomography (PET) was used as a quantitative tool to evaluate the feasibility of such an approach. Seven patients were included in the study. Two had MSA and OH, three had probable IPD and OH (duration of disease, >3 years), one had probable IPD without OH (disease duration, 3 years) and one had possible IPD without OH (disease duration, 2 years). Ratios of maximal (11)C-HED uptake in the myocardium to that in the liver at 5 and 40 min post injection (p.i.) and - based on kinetic modelling - tracer influx rates K(1) were calculated. Compared with MSA patients ( n=2), IPD patients with OH ( n=3) showed definitely lower uptake ratios at both 5 min p.i. (0.39-0.57 vs 0.78-0.79) and 40 min p.i. (0.21-0.60 vs 0.89-1.06), as well as lower K(1) values (0.198-0.359 vs 0.384-0.450 min(-1)). The patient with probable IPD without OH showed intermediate values (uptake ratio at 5 min: 0.65; uptake ratio at 40 min: 0.87; K(1)=0.363). In the patient with possible IPD, values (uptake ratio at 5 min: 0.96; uptake ratio at 40 min: 1.04; K(1)=0.400) did not differ from those observed in MSA. These results support the hypothesis that measurement of myocardial innervation may contribute to the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders and suggest a need for quantitative pathophysiological imaging, particularly at early stages of disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12483420,N,clinical,,,

The stimuli used were spring-loaded cylinders. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with positron emission tomography (PET). The active fields were related to cytoarchitectonic areas of the somatosensory cortex (areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2) and the primary motor cortex (areas 4a and 4p). We hypothesized that SSTIFF and KIN would activate areas 3a and 2. All three conditions, when contrasted against a rest condition, activated cytoarchitectural areas 3b, 1, and 2, and presumptive somatosensory areas in the left parietal operculum and right supramarginal gyrus in accordance with these areas receiving information from cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents. Area 3a was only activated in SSTIFF and KIN, consistent with observations in monkeys and cats, showing that afferents from muscle receptors project to area 3a, and indicating that a similar arrangement seems to be apparent in humans. SSTIFF and KIN activated the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum, the left area 4a and left area 2 more than did PRESS, likely due to a combination of active movements and muscle receptor feed-back.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14505336,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2003 Nov 20.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Space-occupying brain edema is a life-threatening complication in patients with large middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. To determine predictors of this detrimental process, we investigated alterations of extracellular non-transmitter amino acid concentrations in peri-infarct tissue. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with infarctions covering >50% of the MCA territory in early cranial CT scans were included in the study. Probes for microdialysis, intracranial pressure, and tissue oxygen pressure were placed into the noninfarcted ipsilateral frontal lobe. Positron emission tomography imaging was performed in 16 of these patients to measure cerebral blood flow in the tissue around the neuromonitoring probes. RESULTS: Fourteen of the 31 patients developed a malignant MCA infarction, and 17 did not. The patients in the malignant group had significantly lower extracellular concentrations of non-transmitter amino acids than those in the benign group in the first 12 hours of neuromonitoring. At this time, CBF values determined in regions of interest around the probes by positron emission tomography and tissue oxygen pressure showed that the monitored tissues were not yet infarcted, and no differences in transmitter amino acids concentrations were found between the 2 groups. Furthermore, extracellular concentrations of non-transmitter amino acids were negatively correlated with size of infarction. CONCLUSIONS: We assume that reduction of non-transmitter amino acid concentrations reflects an expansion of the extracellular space by vasogenic edema formation in peri-infarct tissue of patients with malignant MCA infarction. Our findings facilitate early prediction of malignant edema formation and may help to increase knowledge of the pathophysiology of the peri-infarct zone of large MCA infarction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631090,N,no corr,,,

The purpose of this study was to assess cortisol responsivity to a stressful cognitive challenge in patients with PTSD related to childhood abuse. Salivary cortisol levels, as well as heart rate and blood pressure, were measured before and after a stressful cognitive challenge in patients with abuse-related PTSD (N=23) and healthy comparison subjects (N=18). PTSD patients had 61% higher group mean cortisol levels in the time period leading up to the cognitive challenge, and 46% higher cortisol levels during the time period of the cognitive challenge, compared to controls. Both PTSD patients and controls had a similar 66-68% increase in cortisol levels from their own baseline with the cognitive challenge. Following the cognitive challenge, cortisol levels fell in both groups and were similar in PTSD and control groups.

We hypothesized that one of the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity is increased activation of brain regions concerned with the processing and modulation of visceral and somatic afferent information, in particular subregions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). METHODS: Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed in age-matched female IBS (n = 10) and IBS + FM (n = 10) subjects using H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography during noxious visceral (rectal) and somatic pressure stimuli. RESULTS: GI symptom severity was significantly higher in the IBS patients compared with the IBS + FM patients (p < 0.05). In addition, IBS + FM patients rated somatic pain as more intense than their abdominal pain (p < 0.05). Whereas the somatic stimulus was less unpleasant than the visceral stimulus for IBS patients without FM, the somatic and visceral stimuli were equally unpleasant in the IBS + FM group. Group differences in regional brain activation were entirely within the middle subregion of the ACC. There was a greater rCBF increase in response to noxious visceral stimuli in IBS patients and to somatic stimuli in IBS + FM patients. CONCLUSION: Chronic stimulus-specific enhancement of ACC responses to sensory stimuli in both syndromes may be associated with cognitive enhancement of either visceral (IBS) or somatic (IBS + FM) sensory input and may play a key pathophysiologic role in these chronic pain syndromes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12818281,N,clinical,,,

While undergoing PET scans, subjects were presented with a series of video-clips showing individuals (who were semi-professional stage actors) telling sad and neutral stories, as if they had personally experienced them. These stories were told with either congruent or incongruent motor expression of emotion (MEE). At the end of each movie, subjects were asked to rate the mood of the communicator and also how likable they found that person. Watching sad stories versus neutral stories was associated with increased activity in emotion processing-related structures, as well as in a set of cortical areas that belong to a ""shared representation"" network, including the right inferior parietal cortex. Motor expression of emotion, regardless of the narrative content of the stories, resulted in a specific regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increase in the left inferior frontal gyrus. The condition of mismatch between the narrative content of the stories and the motor expression of emotion elicited a significant skin conductance response and strong rCBF increase in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior frontal gyrus which are involved in dealing with social conflict. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model of feeling sympathy that relies on both the shared representation and the affective networks. Interestingly, this network was not activated when subjects watched inappropriate social behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12459211,N,no corr,,,

METHOD: Grief was elicited in eight bereaved women through photographs of the deceased versus a stranger, combined with words specific to the death event versus neutral words. Use of both pictures and words resulted in a 2x2 factorial design. RESULTS: Three brain regions were independently activated by the picture and word factors: posterior cingulate cortex, medial/superior frontal gyrus, and cerebellum. The two factors also activated distinct regions: for the picture factor, they were the cuneus, superior lingual gyrus, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus; and for the word factor, they were the precuneus, precentral gyrus, midbrain, and vermis. The interaction of the two factors showed significant activation in the cerebellar vermis. CONCLUSIONS: Grief is mediated by a distributed neural network that subserves affect processing, mentalizing, episodic memory retrieval, processing of familiar faces, visual imagery, autonomic regulation, and modulation/coordination of these functions. This neural network may account for the unique, subjective quality of grief and provide new leads in understanding the health consequences of grief and the neurobiology of attachment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14594740,N,no corr,,,

A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal cortex during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an attenuation of the response of the amygdala to these same stimuli, providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional regulation. METHODS: In the current study, we have explored the generalizability of this functional network by using threatening and fearful non-face stimuli derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), as well as the influence of this network on peripheral autonomic responses. RESULTS: Similar to the earlier findings with facial expressions, blood oxygen level dependent fMRI revealed that whereas perceptual processing of IAPS stimuli was associated with a bilateral amygdala response, cognitive evaluation of these same stimuli was associated with attenuation of this amygdala response and a correlated increase in response of the right prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, this pattern was reflected in changes in skin conductance.

Parallel measurement of HR changes and changes of local intensity of blood flow as indexed by fMRI in a procedure eliciting emotions allowed us to pinpoint areas of the brain responsible for HR variations during emotional arousal.

In condition eliciting negative emotions we also detected activation of occipito-temporal regions and additionally activation of bilateral anterior insulae, right amygdala and right superior temporal gyrus. The results show that structures constituting neural network involved in HR control during emotional arousal are affect specific. Particularly the central circuit controlling HR in negative affect includes the amygdala, while central circuit controlling HR in positive affect includes the hypothalamus. Additionally activation of bilateral occipito-temporal cortex proves enhancement of visual processing of emotional material as compared to neutral material in both positive and negative affect. This might be attributed to top-down processes originating in the frontal lobe and related to shifting attention to the emotionally relevant stimuli. Activation of insular cortex is probably related to autonomic arousal accompanying watching emotional content (e.g. sweating, heart-rate changes etc.).

Smoking marijuana increased rCBF in the ventral forebrain and cerebellar cortex in both groups, but resulted in significantly less frontal lobe activation in chronic users. Counting rate increased after smoking marijuana in both groups, as did a behavioral measure of self-paced tapping, and both increases correlated with rCBF in the cerebellum.

We used positron emission tomography with 15O-water to study neural networks associated with startle modulation by phobic fear in a group of subjects with specific snake or spider phobia, but not both, during exposure to pictures of their feared and non-feared objects, paired and unpaired with acoustic startle stimuli. Measurement of eye electromyographic activity confirmed startle potentiation during the phobic as compared with the non-phobic condition. Employing a factorial design, we evaluated brain correlates of startle modulation as the interaction between startle and affect, using the double subtraction contrast (phobic startle vs. phobic alone) vs. (non-phobic startle vs. non-phobic alone). As a result of startle potentiation, a significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow was found in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region, and medially in the affective division of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These results provide evidence from functional brain imaging for a modulatory role of the amygdaloid complex on startle reactions in humans. They also point to the involvement of the affective ACC in the processing of startle stimuli during emotionally aversive experiences. The co-activation of these areas may reflect increased attention to fear-relevant stimuli. Thus, we suggest that the amygdaloid area and the ACC form part of a neural system dedicated to attention and orientation to danger, and that this network modulates startle during negative affect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12956731,N,no corr,,,

To address these issues, we investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the activity of the contralateral mesial hemispheric wall in 56 healthy volunteers while they expected the stimulation of one foot, which could be either painful or innocuous. The waiting period was characterized by emotional arousal, a moderate rise in heart rate, and by increases in mean fMRI signals in the medial thalamus, mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, and in the putative foot area of the primary somatosensory and motor cortex. The same brain regions, excepting posterior cingulate, were also activated by somatosensory stimulation. We identified by cross-correlation analysis a cluster population whose fMRI signal time course was related to the mean heart rate (HR) profile, showing selective changes of activity during the waiting period. Positively correlated clusters were found mainly in sensorimotor areas, mid- and posterior cingulate, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Negatively correlated clusters predominated in the perigenual anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. HR clusters had different characteristics from, and showed limited spatial overlap with, clusters whose fMRI signals were related to the psychophysical pain intensity profile; however, both cluster populations were affected by anticipation. These findings unravel a complex pattern of brain activity during uncertain anticipation of noxious input, likely related both to changes in the level of arousal and to cognitive modulation of the pain system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12948728,M,ascorbic acid?,uns,,

Under control conditions, breath holding caused increases in PET,CO2 (7 +/- 1 mmHg) and in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (15 +/- 2 mmHg). A transient hyperventilation (PET,CO2 -7 +/- 1 mmHg vs. baseline) occurred post-apnoea. CFV increased during apnoeas (by 42 +/- 3 %) and decreased below baseline (by 20 +/- 2 %) during post-apnoea hyperventilation. In the post-apnoea recovery period, CFV returned to baseline in 45 +/- 4 s. The post-apnoea decrease in CFV did not occur when hyperventilation was prevented. During ganglionic blockade, which abolished the increase in MAP, apnoea-induced increases in CFV were partially attenuated (by 26 +/- 2 %). Increases in PET,CO2 and decreases in oxyhaemoglobin saturation (Sa,O2) (by 2 +/- 1 %) during breath holds were identical in the intact and blocked conditions. Ganglionic blockade had no effect on the slope of the CFV response to hypocapnia but it reduced the CFV response to hypercapnia (by 17 +/- 5 %). We attribute this effect to abolition of the hypercapnia-induced increase in MAP. Peak increases in CFV during 20 s Mueller manoeuvres (40 +/- 3 %) were the same as control breath holds, despite a 15 mmHg initial, transient decrease in MAP. Hyperoxia also had no effect on the apnoea-induced increase in CFV (40 +/- 4 %). We conclude that apnoea-induced fluctuations in CFV were caused primarily by increases and decreases in arterial partial pressure of CO2 (Pa,CO2) and that sympathetic nervous system activity was not required for either the initiation or the maintenance of the cerebrovascular response to hyper- and hypocapnia. Increased MAP or other unknown influences of autonomic activation on the cerebral circulation played a smaller but significant role in the apnoea-induced increase in CFV; however, negative intrathoracic pressure and the small amount of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation caused by 20 s apnoea did not affect CFV.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12588894,N,no corr,,,

Statistical parametric mapping and region of interest analysis were performed to identify and compare differences in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) for each distension pressure within and between the groups of interest.

We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 28 subjects to study this network as a function of odor hedonic valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant), active hedonic judgments versus passive sensation of hedonically charged odors, handedness, and gender. Two functional runs were performed, with pleasant and unpleasant odors presented in different epochs. In the first run, subjects passively smelled odorants, whereas in the second run they rated degree of odor pleasantness or unpleasantness by using a ""finger-span"" technique that simulated a visual rating scale. Electrodermal and plethysmography responses were simultaneously recorded to control for covert, physiological manifestations of the emotional response. The piriform-amygdala area and ventral insula were activated more for unpleasant than pleasant odors. More extreme ratings were also associated with higher electrodermal amplitude, suggesting that activation stemmed more from emotional or hedonic intensity than valence, and that unpleasant odors induced more arousal than pleasant odors. Unpleasant odors activated the left ventral insula in right-handers and the right ventral insula in left-handers, suggesting lateralized processing of emotional odors as a function of handedness. Active decisions about odor pleasantness induced specific left orbitofrontal cortex activation, implicating the role of this area in the conscious assessment of the emotional quality of odors. Finally, left orbitofrontal cortex was more active in women than men, potentially in relation to women's well-documented advantage in odor identification.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14568446,N,no corr,,,

Our study addresses this dilemma by directly comparing human neural processing of intensity-equated visceral and cutaneous pain. Seven subjects underwent fMRI scanning during visceral and cutaneous pain produced by balloon distention of the distal esophagus and contact heat on the midline chest. Stimulus intensities producing nonpainful and painful sensations, interleaved with rest periods, were presented in each functional run. Analyses compared painful to nonpainful conditions. A similar neural network, including secondary somatosensory and parietal cortices, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, was activated by visceral and cutaneous painful stimuli. However, cutaneous pain evoked higher activation bilaterally in the anterior insular cortex. Further, cutaneous but not esophageal pain activated ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, despite higher affective scores for visceral pain. Visceral but not cutaneous pain activated bilateral inferior primary somatosensory cortex, bilateral primary motor cortex, and a more anterior locus within anterior cingulate cortex. Our results reveal a common cortical network subserving cutaneous and visceral pain that could underlie similarities in the pain experience. However, we also observed differential activation patterns within insular, primary somatosensory, motor, and prefrontal cortices that may account for the ability to distinguish visceral and cutaneous pain as well as the differential emotional, autonomic and motor responses associated with these different sensations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12611986,N,no corr,,,

In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that emotional information such as emotional faces may contribute to the organization of long-lasting episodic memory. In the present study, we investigated the activations related to the recognition of people's names in the context of emotional and neutral face-name associative learning. Before fMRI scanning, subjects learned face-name associations that included emotionally positive and neutral facial expressions. In immediate (5 min later) and delayed (2 weeks later) recognition with fMRI scanning, subjects were presented with studied faces with two names, and were asked to choose the correct associative name learned previously. Recognition-related activations were identified in the anterior part of bilateral temporal lobe for immediate recognition and only in the left temporal lobe for delayed recognition. Further analysis confirmed the time-dependent change in activation of the right anterior temporal lobe. Activation related to the processing of faces with positive expressions were observed in the left periamygdaloid area and temporal pole, although emotional information did not have an influence on task performance in this study.

However, there is some evidence that dopaminergic effects are involved in the cardiovascular actions of these drugs. Here, we evaluated this association in humans. METHODS: Positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C]raclopride, a dopamine (DA) D2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous DA for occupancy of the D2 receptors, were used to measure changes in brain DA after different doses of intravenous methylphenidate in 14 healthy subjects. Cardiovascular (heart rate and blood pressure) and catecholamine (plasma epinephrine and norepineprhine) responses were determined in parallel to assess their relationships to methylphenidate-induced changes in brain DA. RESULTS: Methylphenidate administration significantly increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and epinephrine concentration in plasma. The increases in blood pressure were significantly correlated with methylphenidate-induced increases of DA in striatum (r>0.78, P<0.001) and of plasma epinephrine levels (r>0.82, P<0.0005). In turn methylphenidate-induced DA increases in striatum were correlated with increases of epinephrine in plasma (r=0.85, P<0.0001). Subjects in whom methylphenidate did not increase DA had no change in blood pressure or in plasma epinephrine concentration. DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that methylphenidate-induced increases in blood pressure are in part due to its central dopaminergic effects. They also suggest that methylphenidate's pressor effects may be in part mediated by DA-induced increases in peripheral epinephrine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12589522,N,pharma study,,,

In accordance with evidence from evolutionary psychology as well as from developmental psychology, we argue that cooperation is a socially rewarding process and is associated with specific left medial orbitofrontal cortex involvement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488424,N,no corr,,,

DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional study of the brain's response to tasting and consuming a satiating meal in 11 postobese (age: 40+/-6 y, body mass index (BMI): 23.6+/-1.9 kg/m(2)), 23 obese (age: 29+/-6 y, BMI: 39.6+/-3.8 kg/m(2)) and 21 lean (age: 33+/-9 y, BMI: 22.8+/-2.1 kg/m(2)) subjects. MEASUREMENTS: Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF, a marker of neural activity) at baseline (after a 36-h fast), after tasting and after consuming a satiating liquid meal was assessed using positron emission tomography and state-dependent changes (taste-baseline; satiation-baseline), and compared across groups. Subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were measured by a visual analogue scale and body fatness by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: In response to tasting the liquid meal, changes in rCBF were different in the obese as compared to the lean individuals (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in the middle insula (peak voxel, x=-41, y=1, z=8; Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates) and posterior cingulate cortex (peak voxel, x=17, y=-47, z=40). The middle insular cortex exhibited a similar increase of neural activity in the obese and postobese subjects, whereas in the lean subjects the regional activity did not change. In the posterior cingulate cortex, the changes in rCBF in the postobese subjects were not different from those in the other groups. In response to a satiating amount of the same liquid meal, changes in rCBF were different in the obese as compared to the lean individuals (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) in the posterior hippocampus (peak voxel, x=21, y=-45, x=4), posterior cingulate cortex (peak voxel, x=17, y=-47, z=40), and amygdala (peak voxel, x=27, y=1, z=-24). The posterior hippocampus exhibited a similar decrease of neural activity in the obese and postobese subjects, whereas in the lean subjects the regional activity increased. In the posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, the changes in rCBF were not different between the postobese and lean individuals. None of the changes in neural activity were correlated with the age of the individuals, the subjective ratings of hunger and fullness, or the meal induced-changes in plasma glucose, insulin, or serum free fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Persistence of abnormal neural responses to a meal in the postobese individuals, a group at high risk for relapse, indicates that a predisposition to obesity may involve areas of the brain that control complex aspects of eating behavior including anticipation and reward, chemosensory perception, and autonomic control of digestion (insular cortex), as well as enteroception and learning/memory (hippocampus).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14676847,N,no corr,,,

Because of the aversive nature of the unconditioned stimulus effects of accompanying fear conditioning were expected. METHODS: In 20 healthy adult subjects leg withdrawal reflex conditioning was performed using a standard delay protocol during MR-scanning. Electromyographic recordings from the anterior tibial and biceps femoris muscles were used to quantify conditioned responses. Fear-related changes of heart rate were assessed. RESULTS: In the group of all subjects a significant increase of cerebellar activation was found in the anterior and posterior vermis. In the group of subjects (n=9) who showed conditioned leg withdrawal responses cerebellar activation was more pronounced in parts of the anterior vermis, which correspond to the known leg representation. In the group of subjects (n=11) who did not develop conditioned responses cerebellar activation was more pronounced in the posterolateral hemispheres. Changes of heart rate, however, did not significantly differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that areas within the anterior vermis are involved in conditioning of the leg withdrawal response. The present results, however, do not allow to differentiate between motor performance, learning or timing-related processes. Areas in the posterior vermis and cerebellar hemispheres may be related to concomitant fear conditioning.

Exposure to angry male as opposed to angry female faces activated the visual cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus significantly more in men than in women. A similar sex-differential brain activation pattern was present during exposure to fearful but not neutral faces. Previous behavioral studies indicate enhanced physiological arousal in men but not in women during exposure to angry male asopposed to female faces, and brain imaging studies have shown that the occipital cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus are influenced by activity in the autonomic nervous system as well as by visualattention. Hence, we suggest that the elevated occipital and anterior cingulate activation in men during confrontation with other angry and fearful males may reflect enhanced vigilance in a potentially dangerous situation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15535168,N,no corr,,,

Increased task difficulty resulted in decreased heart period (indicating cardioacceleration) and decreased HF‐HPV (indicating decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity). Task‐induced decreases in heart period and HF‐HPV were associated with concurrent increases and decreases in rCBF to cortical and subcortical brain regions that are speculated to regulate cardiac autonomic activity during behavioral processes: the medial‐prefrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala–hippocampal complex, and the cerebellum.

METHODS: We examined functional connectivity in patients with PTSD and healthy trauma survivors during repeated symptom provocation using H(2)O(15) positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Memory retrieval networks (right prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and visual cortex) were common to both groups. Networks supporting autonomic and emotional control and preparatory motor action (amygdala, anterior cingulate, subcallosal gyrus, and premotor cortex) differed between the two groups and became progressively disparate with successive presentations of the traumatic script. Patterns of effective connectivity demonstrated the predominance of direct influences of the amygdala on visual cortex, subcallosal gyrus, and anterior cingulate in PTSD but not in control subjects. There was little evidence for failure of inhibition of cingulate or subcallosal cortex over the amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: These patterns might represent excessive influences of the amygdala over regions involved in autonomic, and higher-order visual memory processing in PTSD.

These studies are based on the assumption that DA exerts a competitive inhibition on radioligand binding. To test this, we used PET and a Scatchard approach to investigate whether the decrease in [11C]raclopride binding following amphetamine results from competitive or noncompetitive interactions with DA. METHODS: Scatchard analyses of [11C]raclopride/PET data were used to quantify changes in apparent D2-receptor density (Bmax) and radioligand apparent affinity (K'D) at baseline and after amphetamine pretreatment (2 mg/kg; intravenous) in cats. RESULTS: Amphetamine induced a 46% decrease in [11C]raclopride binding in the striatum of five cats. Scatchard analyses revealed that this decrease in binding was due to a 28% decrease in Bmax and a concomitant 35% increase in K'D. CONCLUSIONS: Competition with DA is an insufficient explanation for the decrease in [11C]raclopride binding observed after amphetamine. Noncompetitive interactions, likely representing D2-receptor internalization, also play an important role in this phenomenon. This finding may have important implications for the interpretation of amphetamine-raclopride PET studies in schizophrenia because dysregulation of the agonist-induced internalization of D2 receptors was recently suggested in this disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15184038,N,methods paper,,,

METHODS: The authors used positron emission tomography to measure the effect of various concentrations of propofol on pain-evoked changes in regional cerebral blood flow. Fifteen volunteers were scanned while warm and painful heat stimuli were presented to the volar forearm using a contact thermode during administration of target propofol concentrations of 0.0 microg/ml (alert control), 0.5 microg/ml (mild sedation), 1.5 microg/ml (moderate sedation), and 3.5 microg/ml (unconsciousness). RESULTS: During the 0.5-microg/ml target propofol concentration (mild sedation), the subjects' pain ratings increased relative to the alert control condition; correspondingly, pain-evoked regional cerebral blood flow increased in the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, when subjects lost consciousness (3.5 microg/ml), pain-evoked responses in the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex were no longer observed, whereas significant pain-evoked activation remained in the insular cortex.

Epub 2004 May 25.","RATIONALE: Perospirone is a new antipsychotic drug in which dopamine D(2) antagonist and serotonin 5-HT(2) antagonist effects have been found in animal studies. It was developed by a Japanese pharmaceutical company and launched in 2001. Perospirone's receptor binding profile may resemble that of atypical antipsychotic drugs, but to date there has been no evidence relating to its receptor binding affinity in the human brain. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the receptor binding profile of perospirone via neuroendocrine challenge tests. METHODS: Twenty subjects (ten females and ten males) were tested on four occasions in a double-blind, cross-over design receiving: (a) placebo, (b) perospirone 4 mg, (c) paroxetine 20 mg, and (d) paroxetine 20 mg plus perospirone 4 mg, administered orally at 8.00 a.m. Plasma cortisol and prolactin levels were measured prior to administration and every hour for 6 h thereafter. In addition, psychological responses rated by visual analog scales and vital signs such as body temperature, pulse, and blood pressure were assessed in combination with blood sampling. RESULTS: Perospirone 4 mg increased prolactin levels significantly higher than placebo, whereas paroxetine 20 mg plus perospirone 4 mg significantly attenuated cortisol responses induced by paroxetine 20 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that perospirone has the characteristics of both D(2) and 5-HT(2) antagonist in the human brain.

Ageing is associated with impaired CBF and impaired nitric oxide mediated vasodilator responses. The role of nitric oxide in the regulation of basal CBF in young and older subjects was investigated, using the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NMMA as pharmacological tool. METHODS: We used a gradient echo phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging technique to investigate the role of nitric oxide in the regulation of cerebral blood flow in young (25+/-7.1 years; n=8) and old (78+/-6.6 years; n=7) volunteers. The study was performed in a double-blinded fashion and consisted of two study days. On one day the effects of the intravenously infused L-NMMA on CBF and blood pressure was measured and on the other day the effects of a matching placebo. RESULTS: Basal CBF was significantly lower in old compared to young subjects (590+/-20 vs 704+/-20 ml/min), while the cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) levels were significantly higher (0.15+/-0.01 (arbitrary units) vs 0.12+/-0.01, respectively).

Most of these studies used delay procedures, in which the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (UCS) coterminate. Less is known about brain regions that support trace conditioning, a procedure in which an interval of time (trace interval) elapses between CS termination and UCS onset. Previous work suggests significant overlap in the neural circuitry supporting delay and trace fear conditioning, although trace conditioning requires recruitment of additional brain regions. In the present event-related fMRI study, skin conductance and continuous measures of UCS expectancy were recorded concurrently with whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging during direct comparison of delay and trace discrimination learning. Significant activation was observed within the visual cortex for all CSs. Anterior cingulate and medial thalamic activity reflected associative learning common to both delay and trace procedures. Activations within the supplementary motor area (SMA), frontal operculum, middle frontal gyri, and inferior parietal lobule were specifically associated with trace interval processing. The hippocampus displayed BOLD signal increases early in training during all conditions; however, differences were observed in hippocampal response magnitude related to the accuracy of predicting UCS presentations. These results demonstrate overlapping patterns of activation within the anterior cingulate, medial thalamus, and visual cortex during delay and trace procedures, with additional recruitment of the hippocampus, SMA, frontal operculum, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule during trace conditioning. These data suggest that the hippocampus codes temporal information during trace conditioning, whereas brain regions supporting working memory processes maintain the CS-UCS representation during the trace interval.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14715954,N,no corr,,,

Regional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity was imaged during CSS and other motor and sensory procedures, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis with head motion artifact correction. Physiatric examination and MRI established the location and extent of spinal cord injury. In order to demarcate the NTS, a gustatory stimulus and hand movement were used to activate the superior region of the NTS and the Nucleus Cuneatus adjacent to the inferior region of the NTS, respectively. Each of four women with interruption, or ""complete"" injury, of the spinal cord (ASIA criteria), and one woman with significant, but ""incomplete"" SCI, all at or above T10, showed activation of the inferior region of the NTS during CSS.

In this study, the authors wanted to assess the effects of racemic ketamine on regional glucose metabolic rate (rGMR) in similar conditions to establish whether ketamine truly induces disturbed coupling between cerebral blood flow and metabolism. METHODS: 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose was used as a positron emission tomography tracer to quantify rGMR on 12 brain regions of interest of nine healthy male volunteers at baseline and during a 300-ng/ml ketamine target concentration level. In addition, voxel-based analysis was performed for the relative changes in rGMR using statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD measured ketamine serum concentration was 326.4+/-86.3 ng/ml. The mean arterial pressure was slightly increased (maximally by 16.4%) during ketamine infusion (P < 0.001). Ketamine increased absolute rGMR significantly in most regions of interest studied. The greatest increases were detected in the thalamus (14.6+/-15.9%; P = 0.029) and in the frontal (13.6+/-13.1%; P = 0.011) and parietal cortices (13.1+/-11.2%; P = 0.007). Absolute rGMR was not decreased anywhere in the brain. The voxel-based analysis revealed relative rGMR increases in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. CONCLUSIONS: Global increases in rGMR seem to parallel ketamine-induced increases in cerebral blood flow detected in the authors' earlier study. Therefore, ketamine-induced disturbance of coupling between cerebral blood flow and metabolism is highly unlikely. The previously observed decrease in oxygen extraction fraction may be due to nonoxidative glucose metabolism during ketamine-induced increase in glutamate release.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15114201,N,pharma study,,,

A daily symptom diary was used to measure symptom improvement. Increases in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC) activity from pre- to post-placebo predicted self-reported symptom improvement, and this relationship was mediated by changes in dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), typically associated with pain unpleasantness.

BACKGROUND: Hemicrania continua is a strictly unilateral, continuous headache of moderate intensity, with superimposed exacerbations of severe intensity that are accompanied by trigeminal autonomic features and migrainous symptoms. The syndrome is exquisitely responsive to indomethacin. Its clinical phenotype overlaps with that of the trigeminal autonomic headaches and migraine in which the hypothalamus and the brainstem, respectively, have been postulated to play central pathophysiologic roles. We hypothesized, based on the clinical phenotype, that hemicrania continua may involve activations in the hypothalamus, or dorsal rostral pons, or both. METHODS: Seven patients with hemicrania continua were studied in two sessions each. In one session, the patients were scanned during baseline pain and when rendered completely pain free after being administered indomethacin 100 mg intramuscularly. In the other session, the patients were scanned during baseline pain and when still in pain after being administered placebo intramuscularly. Seven age- and sex-matched nonheadache subjects acted as the control group. The scan images were processed and analyzed using SPM99. RESULTS: There was a significant activation of the contralateral posterior hypothalamus and ipsilateral dorsal rostral pons in association with the headache of hemicrania continua. In addition, there was activation of the ipsilateral ventrolateral midbrain, which extended over the red nucleus and the substantia nigra, and bilateral pontomedullary junction. No intracranial vessel dilatation was obvious. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated activations of various subcortical structures, in particular the posterior hypothalamus and the dorsal rostral pons. If posterior hypothalamic and brainstem activation are considered as markers of trigeminal autonomic headaches and migrainous syndromes, respectively, then the activation pattern demonstrated in hemicrania continua mirrors the clinical phenotype, with its overlap with trigeminal autonomic headaches and migraine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15330820,N,no corr,,,

This study implemented a counting Stroop task that presented incongruent (INC) and congruent (CON) stimuli at two speeds to probe dorsal (dACC) and ventral (vACC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Eighteen healthy subjects completed the task twice: once outside the scanner while heart rate variability (HRV) was recorded and once during fMRI. In both sessions, subjects completed two runs. Stimuli were presented every 2.0 s in one run and every 1.5 s in the other. fMRI data analysis revealed two important findings. First, by computing differential activation between INC and CON stimuli, a cluster of activation related to response inhibition was observed in the left dACC. Additionally, by calculating the interaction of speed with stimulus congruency, a cluster of activation was observed in the left vACC. This activation correlated significantly with high-frequency HRV (P < 0.02 for CON and P < 0.003 for INC) and represents the parasympathetic modulatory role of the vACC. This study supports the notion of functional subdivisions within the ACC and links the processes of cognitive interference and parasympathetic modulation with activation in specific subregions of the ACC, a structure that is critical for the interface between cognition and emotion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15219587,Y,corr,rand,HRV,

Little is known about the relationship of VNS parameters to brain function. Using the interleaved VNS /functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we tested whether variations of VNS pulse width (PW) would produce different immediate brain activation in a manner consistent with single neuron PW studies. METHODS: Twelve adult patients with major depression, treated with VNS, underwent three consecutive VNS/fMRI scans, each randomly using one of three PWs (130 micros, 250 micros, or 500 micros). The data were analyzed with SPM2. RESULTS: Global activations induced by PWs 250 and 500 were both significantly greater than that induced by PW 130 but not significantly different from each other. For global deactivation, PWs 130 and 250 were both significantly greater than PW 500 but not significantly different from each other. Regional similarities and differences were also seen with the various PWs. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm our hypothesis that VNS at PW 500 globally produces no more activation than does PW 250, and PW 130 is insufficient for activation of some regions. These data suggest that PW is an important variable in producing VNS brain effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050863,N,clinical,,,

Successful performance of either biofeedback task (where SCL changed in the intended direction) was associated with enhanced activity in mid-OFC. The findings point to a dissociation between neural systems controlling basal sympathetic tone (SCL) and transient skin conductance responses (SCRs).

Thus, systems involved in the autonomic response to painful stimulation, for example the hypothalamus and the brainstem, would be expected to attenuate the response to pain during prolonged stimulation. This suggestion is in line with the hypothesis that the brainstem is specifically involved in the initial response to pain. To probe this hypothesis, we performed a positron emission tomography (PET) study where we scanned subjects during the first and second minute of a prolonged tonic painful cold stimulation (cold pressor test) and nonpainful cold stimulation. Galvanic skin response (GSR) was recorded during the PET scanning as an index of autonomic sympathetic response. In the main effect of pain, we observed increased activity in the thalamus bilaterally, in the contralateral insula and in the contralateral anterior cingulate cortex but no significant increases in activity in the primary or secondary somatosensory cortex. The autonomic response (GSR) decreased with stimulus duration. Concomitant with the autonomic response, increased activity was observed in brainstem and hypothalamus areas during the initial vs. the late stimulation. This effect was significantly stronger for the painful than for the cold stimulation. Activity in the brainstem showed pain-specific covariation with areas involved in pain processing, indicating an interaction between the brainstem and cortical pain networks. The findings indicate that areas in the brainstem are involved in the initial response to noxious stimulation, which is also characterized by an increased sympathetic response.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15193631,M,prev analysis no corr,,,

In accord with this, several studies have shown increased amygdala activity during fear conditioning and the processing of fear-relevant material in human subjects. In contrast, functional neuroimaging studies of pain have shown a decreased amygdala activity. It has previously been proposed that the observed deactivations of the amygdala in these studies indicate a cognitive strategy to adapt to a distressful but in the experimental setting unavoidable painful event. In this positron emission tomography study, we show that a simple contextual manipulation, immediately preceding a painful stimulation, that increases the anticipated duration of the painful event leads to a decrease in amygdala activity and modulates the autonomic response during the noxious stimulation. On a behavioral level, 7 of the 10 subjects reported that they used coping strategies more intensely in this context. We suggest that the altered activity in the amygdala may be part of a mechanism to attenuate pain-related stress responses in a context that is perceived as being more aversive. The study also showed an increased activity in the rostral part of anterior cingulate cortex in the same context in which the amygdala activity decreased, further supporting the idea that this part of the cingulate cortex is involved in the modulation of emotional and pain networks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15453980,N,no corr,,,

We extended this research by examining the effects of orbitofrontal damage on emotional responses to unanticipated and anticipated acoustic startles and collecting a more extensive set of physiological measures, emotional facial behavior, and self-reported emotional experience. Consistent with previous research, patients showed intact physiology to an unanticipated startle but failed to show appropriate anticipatory cardiovascular responses (patients' heart rates decreased, controls' increased). In addition, patients displayed more surprise facial behavior and reported marginally more fear than did controls in response to the unanticipated startle.

All patients showed clear MEG signals in both the affected and unaffected hemispheres, indicating well synchronized, stimulus-locked firing of neurons in the primary sensorimotor cortex, but some patients showed no fMRI activation in either the affected or the unaffected hemisphere. In order to clarify the origin of this uncoupling, we investigated the possible role of lesion site, white matter hyperintensities, current medication, risk factors, anatomy of the neck vessels, and cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) as measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) during CO2 inhalation. Neither neuronal activation properties nor any of the considered factors were related to the lack of fMRI activation, with the exception of altered vasomotor reactivity, which was, on the contrary, strongly related.

We distinguish two possible hemodynamic effects of this type: (1). blood flow reduction caused by locally reduced pressure in vessels that share their blood supply with nearby dilated vessels; and (2). blood flow reduction caused by active constriction of vessels under neural control. The first is ruled out as an explanation of negative BOLD by showing that a visual stimulus that stimulates primary visual cortex in one hemisphere can cause extensive suppression in the other hemisphere i.e., it is not a local phenomenon.

Eighteen subjects (12 with spider phobia, 6 healthy controls) underwent H(2)(15)O-positron emission tomography while being continuously presented with pictures of spiders or butterflies. Results showed main effects (spiders>butterflies) in the phobia group in the left fusiform gyrus (FG) and the right parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), with bilateral perirhinal cortex and right limbic areas approaching significance. Group x condition effects were found in the right amygdala and PHG. During spider scans, large habituation effects were observed in the anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL) bilaterally. Regression analyses demonstrated that state anxiety was correlated with activity in left amygdala, bilateral perirhinal cortex, right FG, and periaquaductal grey; by contrast, phobic fear was only associated with right-sided hippocampal activity. We conclude that prolonged exposure to phobic stimuli is associated with a significant decrease in bilateral anterior MTL regional cerebral blood flow. Right anterior MTL, identified when comparing phobic vs. neutral stimuli and habituation to phobic vs. neutral stimuli in the phobia group, implicates this region in phobic fear. Analyses of covariance suggest a further functional segregation with state anxiety being linked to enhanced activity in amygdala, perirhinal cortex, and tegmentum, and phobic fear with enhanced right hippocampal activity, suggesting a neuroanatomical differentiation between emotional-vegetative and cognitive aspects of (phobic) fear.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15598549,N,no corr,,,

Phasic SCRs followed a U-shape pattern across early, middle and late presentations of fear stimuli. fMRI data revealed a concomitant temporal sequence of preferential somatosensory insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and left amygdala engagement.

It was predicted that paranoid patients would be distinguished by a disjunction of hyperarousal but reduced amygdala and medial prefrontal activity relative to both healthy comparison subjects and patients with nonparanoid schizophrenia. METHOD: Pictures depicting facial expressions of fear were presented to 27 schizophrenia patients (13 paranoid, 14 nonparanoid) and 22 matched healthy comparison subjects in an implicit perception task to evoke limbic activity. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and skin conductance arousal recordings were acquired during presentation of faces expressing fear or neutral emotion. Responses to fear stimuli were further examined by contrasting those that were associated with a skin conductance response (""with arousal"") and those that were not (""without arousal""). RESULTS: In the comparison subjects, arousal dissociated amygdala/medial prefrontal (""visceral"") networks and hippocampus/lateral prefrontal (""context"") networks for fear perception. Excessive arousal responses were elicited in the schizophrenia subjects, but there was an associated reduction in amygdala/medial prefrontal activity. This disjunction was pronounced in paranoid patients relative to both healthy subjects and nonparanoid patients. Paranoid patients also showed a relatively greater prefrontal deficit for ""without-arousal"" responses. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to reveal a functional disconnection in autonomic and central systems for processing threat-related signals in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. Paranoid cognition may reflect an internally generated cycle of misattribution regarding incoming fear signals due to a breakdown in the regulation of these systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14992974,N,no corr,,,

Due to the wide and intricate connections with cerebrum, we hypothesized that anatomically specific areas in human cerebellum are also modulated by acupuncture stimulation beyond classical involvement of cerebellum in motor coordination. Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to investigate neural substrates responding to the acupuncture stimulation of Pericardium 6 (PC6, Neiguan), an acupoint relevant for the management of nausea including vestibular-related motion sickness. Sham stimulation near the acupoint and tactile stimulation on the skin of the acupoint were given as separate conditions. Psychophysical scores as well as the heart and respiratory rates were measured during each condition. Acupuncture manipulation on PC6, in comparison to the sham acupuncture and tactile stimulation conditions, selectively activated left superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus. Acupuncture-specific neural substrates in cerebellum were also evident in declive, nodulus, and uvula of vermis, quadrangular lobule, cerebellar tonsil, and superior semilunar lobule. Negative MR signal changes, often seen during the acupuncture of analgesic points, were not observed in the present study. Our data suggest that cerebellum serves as important activation loci during the acupuncture stimulation of PC6, and clinical efficacy of PC6 may be mediated by the cerebellar vestibular neuromatrix.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15193624,N,no corr,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in the oxidative metabolic response between myocardial segments with preserved contractile reserve (CR) and those without CR, in segments with and without preserved glucose metabolism (GM), using (11)C-acetate PET. METHODS: Twenty patients with previous myocardial infarction (left ventricular ejection fraction, 37.1% +/- 16.5%) underwent dynamic (11)C-acetate PET at rest and during dobutamine (7.5 microg/kg/min) infusion. GM was evaluated using (18)F-FDG PET and CR was evaluated using DSE. Dysfunctional segments were divided into 3 groups: group A (n = 26) with preserved CR and GM, group B (n = 15) without CR but with preserved GM, and group C (n = 41) without CR and without preserved GM. RESULTS: Resting oxidative metabolism (k mono = monoexponential clearance rate) was preserved in group A and group B (0.052 +/- 0.011/min vs. 0.051 +/- 0.012/min, P = not significant) but was reduced in group C (0.040 +/- 0.015/min) (P < 0.03 vs. group A and group B). The change in k mono, as a measure of the metabolic response to low-dose dobutamine, was significantly higher in group A (0.018 +/- 0.012) than that in group B (0.0075 +/- 0.0096, P < 0.03) and group C (0.0080 +/- 0.012, P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Viable segments based on (18)F-FDG PET have preserved resting oxidative metabolism. However, segments without CR but with preserved GM show a reduction in the oxidative metabolic response to low-dose dobutamine infusion. The decrease in CR may be related to the reduction in the metabolic response to inotropic stimulation despite preservation of tissue viability on (18)F-FDG PET.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534059,N ,no corr,,,

Using fMRI, we investigated human striatal responses to monetary reward while modulating the saliency surrounding its receipt. Money was maximally salient when its receipt depended on a correct response (active) and minimally salient when its receipt was completely independent of the task (passive). The saliency manipulation was confirmed by skin conductance responses and subjective ratings of the stimuli. Significant caudate and nucleus accumbens activations occurred following the active compared to passive money. Such activations were attributed to saliency rather than the motor requirement associated with the active money because striatal activations were not observed when the money was replaced by inconsequential, nonrewarding stimuli.

Intracranial compliance (ICC) and local craniocervical hydrodynamic parameters derived using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging flow measurements were assessed in symptomatic patients and control volunteers to evaluate the role of these factors in the associated pathophysiology. METHODS: Seventeen healthy volunteers and 34 symptomatic patients with CM were studied using a 1.5-tesla MR imager. Cine phase-contrast images of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow to and from the cranium were used to quantify local hydrodynamic parameters (for example, cord displacement and systolic CSF velocity and flow rates) and ICC. The ICC was derived using a previously described method that measures the small, natural changes in intracranial volume and pressure with each cardiac cycle. Differences in the average cord displacement and systolic CSF velocity and flow, comparing healthy volunteers and patients with CM were not statistically significant. Note, however, that a statistically significant lower ICC (20%) was observed in patients compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Previous investigators have focused on CSF flow velocities and cord displacement to explain the pathogenesis of CM. Analysis of results have indicated that ICC is more sensitive than local hydrodynamic parameters to changes in the craniospinal biomechanical properties in symptomatic patients. The authors concluded that decreased ICC better explains CM pathophysiology than local hydrodynamic parameters such as cervical CSF velocities and cord displacement. Low ICC also better explains the onset of symptoms in adulthood given the decline in ICC with aging.",N,N,no phys of interest,,,

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed a significant increase of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and the right frontal opercular region (RFOP). MPFC activity was correlated with psychophysiological and verbal emotional responses across subjects and, like these responses, was independent of the stimulation side. In contrast, RFOP activity was significantly stronger during left than during right hemifield stimulation but did not correlate with psychophysiological or verbal measures of negative affect. These results suggest that emotional responses to an aversive conditioned expressively neutral face are similar in both visual hemifields.

Epub 2005 Sep 6.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Hypoglycaemia unawareness in type 1 diabetes increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia and impairs quality of life for people with diabetes. To explore the central mechanisms of hypoglycaemia awareness, we used [11C]-3-O-methyl-D-glucose (CMG) positron emission tomography (PET) to measure changes in global and regional brain glucose metabolism between euglycaemia and hypoglycaemia in aware and unaware diabetic subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve men with type 1 diabetes, of whom six were characterised as aware and six as unaware of hypoglycaemia, underwent two CMG-PET brain scans while plasma glucose was controlled by insulin and glucose infusion either at euglycaemia (5 mmol/l) or at hypoglycaemia (2.6 mmol/l) in random order. RESULTS: With hypoglycaemia, symptoms and sweating occurred only in the aware group. Brain glucose content fell in both groups (p=0.0002; aware, 1.18+/-0.45 to 0.02+/-0.2 mmol/l; unaware, 1.07+/-0.46 to 0.19+/-0.23 mmol/l), with a relative increase in tracer uptake in prefrontal cortical regions, including the anterior cingulate. No detectable differences were found between groups in global brain glucose transport parameters (K1, k2). The cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) showed a relative rise in the aware subjects (11.839+/-2.432 to 13.958+/-2.372) and a fall in the unaware subjects (from 12.457+/-1.938 to 10.16+/-0.801 micromol 100 g(-1) min(-1), p=0.043). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Hypoglycaemia is associated with reduced brain glucose content in aware and unaware subjects, with a relative preservation of metabolism in areas associated with sympathetic activation. The relative rise in global glucose metabolic rate seen in aware subjects during hypoglycaemia contrasted with the relative fall in the unaware subjects and suggests that cortical neuronal activation is a necessary correlate of the state of hypoglycaemia awareness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16143864,N,no phys of interest,,,

DESIGN: An aversive differential pavlovian delay conditioning paradigm with slides of neutral faces serving as conditioned and painful pressure as unconditioned stimuli. SETTING: The Department of Medical Psychology at the University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.

RESULTS: The healthy controls showed enhanced differential activation in the limbic-prefrontal circuit (amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate) during the acquisition of fear and successful verbal and autonomic conditioning. The psychopaths displayed no significant activity in this circuit and failed to show conditioned skin conductance and emotional valence ratings, although contingency and arousal ratings were normal.

No studies have examined neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHOD: Women with early childhood sexual-abuse-related PTSD (n = 8) and women without abuse or PTSD (n = 11) underwent measurement of psychophysiological (skin conductance) responding as well as positron emission tomographic (PET) measurement of cerebral blood flow during habituation, acquisition and extinction conditions. During habituation subjects were repeatedly exposed to a blue square on a screen. During acquisition, exposure to the blue square (CS) was paired with an electric shock to the forearm (US). With extinction, subjects were again exposed to the blue squares without shock. On a different day subjects went through the same procedure with electric shocks administered randomly in the absence of the blue square. RESULTS: Skin conductance responding to the CS was consistent with the development of conditioned responses with this paradigm.

The rostral (rACC) and dorsal (dACC) ACC cortex are implicated in tasks that require increased response control due to emotional and cognitive interference, respectively.

To clarify the relationship between purely cognitive and psychophysiological accounts of ACC function, we scanned 15 subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed numerical versions of the Stroop task. To index autonomic arousal, we simultaneously measured pupil diameter. Performance errors accounted for most of the variance in a pupil-derived measure of evoked autonomic arousal. In analysis of the functional imaging data, activity within a region spanning rACC and dACC predicted trial-by-trial variation in autonomic response magnitude and was enhanced during error trials, shown using conjunction analyses. Activity within other loci within rACC predicted evoked autonomic arousal and showed sensitivity to errors but did not meet criteria for both.

They administered nonverbal memory and intelligence tests to 30 men with PTSD and 20 men without PTSD who responded. During their initial contact with the participants, 2 experts assessed 3 major coronary-prone characteristics (hyperalertness, tight facial musculature, and explosive speech). They found significant differences between the PTSD and control groups in total Type A scores. Those with the most severe PTSD performed most poorly on visual retention tests and showed the highest scores on self-reported and subjective diastolic blood pressure reactivity during magnetic resonance imaging. In the PTSD group, high error scores on the visual retention test predicted Type A behavior and low scores on the picture memory block design tests predicted high Type A scores. A significant positive correlation was found between Type A and clinician-assessed subjective distress, whereas the correlations were significantly negative between picture memory and Type A behavior Suppressed fear is commonly associated with PTSD; decades of research on Type A behavior have isolated fear as a crucial factor in cardiovascular disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16130309,N,no corr,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the dipping of nocturnal blood pressure in patients receiving antihypertensive treatment after ischemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with a previous history of ischemic stroke and 37 patients with a history of non-ischemic stroke underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and rCBF measurement with single photon emission computed tomography. Of the 47 patients with ischemic stroke, 30 were diagnosed as having suffered atheromatous or embolic stroke, and 37 had an ischemic lesion in the territory of the carotid artery. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures during daytime and night-time were controlled at less than 140/90 mmHg by a low-salt diet or long-acting antihypertensive agents, or both. In patients with ischemic stroke, there were significant negative correlations between the percentage change in nocturnal blood pressure and rCBFs in the thalamus (r = -0.33, P = 0.02), putamen (r = -0.34, P = 0.02) and cerebral cortex (r = -0.31, P = 0.03). Multivariate analysis revealed that only the percentage change in nocturnal blood pressure was related to rCBF. There was a significant positive correlation between rCBFs in the thalamus and the cerebral cortex (r = 0.74, P < 0.05). In patients with non-ischemic stroke, there was no significant correlation between the percentage change in nocturnal blood pressure and rCBFs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the decrease in nocturnal blood pressure is associated with the increase in rCBF in patients with a history of ischemic stroke in the territory of the carotid artery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15834292,N,clinical,,,

METHODS: Sixteen participants (7 men, 9 women aged 47 to 72 years) were classified as high (n = 8) or low (n = 8) blood pressure reactors by the magnitude and temporal consistency of their systolic blood pressure (SBP) reaction to a Stroop color-word interference stressor. Both high and low SBP reactors completed this Stroop stressor while their task-related changes in blood pressure and functional neural activity were assessed in a blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging design. RESULTS: In both high and low SBP reactors, the Stroop-stressor engaged the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, insular, posterior parietal, and the dorsolateral prefrontal regions of the cortex, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. Compared with low reactors, however, high reactors not only showed a larger magnitude increase in SBP to the Stroop stressor, but also an increased activation of the posterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSION: A behavioral stressor that is used widely in cardiovascular reactivity research, the Stroop stressor, engages brain systems that are thought to support both stressor processing and cardiovascular reactivity. Increased activation of the posterior cingulate, a brain region implicated in vigilance to the environment and evaluative emotional processes, may be a functional neural correlate of an individual's tendency to show large-magnitude (exaggerated) blood pressure reactions to behavioral stressors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673621,N,no corr,,,

Using fMRI and this theoretical framework, we are able to distinguish between learning-related brain regions that show long temporal integration (e.g., amygdala) and higher perceptual regions that integrate only over a short period of time (e.g., fusiform face area, parahippocampal place area).

Twelve normal premenopausal women were scanned twice during the early follicular menstrual cycle phase compared with late follicular/midcycle, using negative valence/high arousal versus neutral visual stimuli, validated by concomitant electrodermal activity (EDA). Significantly greater magnitude of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal changes were found during early follicular compared with midcycle timing in central amygdala, paraventricular and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate gyrus (aCING), and peripeduncular nucleus of the brainstem, a network of regions implicated in the stress response. Arousal (EDA) correlated positively with brain activity in amygdala, OFC, and aCING during midcycle but not in early follicular, suggesting less cortical control of amygdala during early follicular, when arousal was increased.

The vascular changes associated with CSD are a large transient increase in blood flow followed by a prolonged decrease lasting greater than 1 h. Currently, the profile of functional vascular activity during this hypovolemic period has not been well characterized. Perfusion-based imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assume a tight coupling between changes in neuronal and vascular activity. Under normal conditions, these variables are well correlated. Characterizing the effect of CSD on this relationship is an important step to understand the impact acute pathophysiological events may have on neurovascular coupling. We examine the effect of CSD on functional changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) evoked by cortical electrophysiological activity for 1 h following CSD induction. CBV signal amplitude, duration, and time to peak show little recovery at 60 min post-induction. Analysis of spontaneous vasomotor activity suggests a decrease in vascular reactivity may play a significant role in the disruption of normal functional CBV responses. Electrophysiological activity is also attenuated but to a lesser degree.

The authors employed functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast to explore the effect of esmolol on the human brain. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of esmolol on cerebral blood flow, cerebral vasoreactivity, and cognitive performance. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were investigated in two separate experimental sessions using functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the first experimental session, a hyperventilation task and a cognitive task, subjects had to perform both tasks twice, once after administration of an esmolol bolus of 1 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 150 microg.kg.min and once without beta-blockade, in a random order. During the second experimental session subjects were scanned at resting state after administration of esmolol. Furthermore, the effect of the esmolol dose on hemodynamic changes caused by beta-adrenergic stimulation with orciprenaline was investigated. RESULTS: Esmolol decreased heart rate and blood pressure during the various experimental conditions and blunted the increase in heart rate and blood pressure caused by orciprenaline. Infusion of esmolol affects neither the blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast during the functional challenges nor the reaction times during the cognitive task. However, the esmolol bolus caused a brief blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast increase.

Recently, positron emission tomography imaging has shown that smokers have a much lower activity of peripheral and brain MAO-A (30%) and -B (40%) isozymes compared to non-smokers. This MAO inhibition results from a pharmacological effect of smoke, but little is known about its mechanism. Working with mainstream smoke collected from commercial cigarettes we confirmed that cigarette smoke is a potent inhibitor of human MAO-A and -B isozymes. MAO inhibition was partly reversible, competitive for MAO-A, and a mixed-type inhibition for MAO-B. Two beta-carboline alkaloids, norharman (beta-carboline) and harman (1-methyl-beta-carboline), were identified by GC-MS, quantified, and isolated from the mainstream smoke by solid phase extraction and HPLC. Kinetics analysis revealed that beta-carbolines from cigarette smoke were competitive, reversible, and potent inhibitors of MAO enzymes. Norharman was an inhibitor of MAO-A (K(i)=1.2+/-0.18 microM) and MAO-B (K(i)=1.12+/-0.19 microM), and harman of MAO-A (K(i)=55.54+/-5.3nM). Beta-carboline alkaloids are psychopharmacologically active compounds that may occur endogenously in human tissues, including the brain. These results suggest that beta-carboline alkaloids from cigarette smoke acting as potent reversible inhibitors of MAO enzymes may contribute to the MAO-reduced activity produced by tobacco smoke in smokers. The presence of MAO inhibitors in smoke like beta-carbolines and others may help us to understand some of the purported neuropharmacological effects associated with smoking.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15582589,N,no phys of interest,,,

DESIGN: Prospective interventional study. SETTING: Neurosciences critical care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eleven acutely head-injured patients requiring norepinephrine to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. INTERVENTIONS: Using positron emission tomography, we have quantified the response to an increase in cerebral perfusion pressure in a region of interest around a brain tissue oxygen sensor (Neurotrend) and microdialysis catheter. Oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood flow were measured with positron emission tomography at a cerebral perfusion pressure of approximately 70 mm Hg and approximately 90 mm Hg using norepinephrine to control cerebral perfusion pressure. All other aspects of physiology were kept stable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cerebral perfusion pressure augmentation resulted in a significant increase in brain tissue oxygen (17 +/- 8 vs. 22 +/- 8 mm Hg; 2.2 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.0 kPa, p < .001) and cerebral blood flow (27.5 +/- 5.1 vs. 29.7 +/- 6.0 mL/100 mL/min, p < .05) and a significant decrease in oxygen extraction fraction (33.4 +/- 5.9 vs. 30.3 +/- 4.6 %, p < .05). There were no significant changes in any of the microdialysis variables (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, glycerol). There was a significant linear relationship between brain tissue oxygen and oxygen extraction fraction (r = .21, p < .05); the brain tissue oxygen value associated with an oxygen extraction fraction of 40% (the mean value for oxygen extraction fraction in normal controls) was 14 mm Hg (1.8 kPa). The cerebral perfusion pressure intervention resulted in a greater percentage increase in brain tissue oxygen than the percentage decrease in oxygen extraction fraction; this suggests that the oxygen gradients between the vascular and tissue compartments were reduced by the cerebral perfusion pressure intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral perfusion pressure augmentation significantly increased levels of brain tissue oxygen and significantly reduced regional oxygen extraction fraction. However, these changes did not translate into predictable changes in regional chemistry. Our results suggest that the ischemic level of brain tissue oxygen may lie at a level below 14 mm Hg (1.8 kPa); however, the data do not allow us to be more specific.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15644668,N,no phys of interest,,,

Compared to baseline, steady-state LBNP at 15 and 35 mmHg decreased CVP (from 7 +/- 1 to 5 +/- 1 and 4 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively) and increased MSNA (from 12 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 3 and 36 +/- 4 bursts min(-1), respectively, both P < 0.05 versus baseline). Furthermore, steady-state LBNP elevated HR from 54 +/- 2 beats min(-1) at baseline to 64 +/- 2 beats min(-1) at 35-mmHg suction. Both mean arterial and pulse pressure were not different between rest and any level of LBNP. Cortical regions demonstrating increased activity that correlated with higher HR and greater LBNP included the right superior posterior insula, frontoparietal cortex and the left cerebellum. Conversely, using the identical statistical paradigm, bilateral anterior insular cortices, the right anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, midbrain and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus showed decreased neural activation. These data corroborate previous investigations highlighting the involved roles of the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala in central autonomic cardiovascular control. In addition, we have provided the first evidence for the identification of the cortical network involved specifically with baroreflex-mediated autonomic cardiovascular function in conscious humans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16150800,Y,LBNP?,rand,,

Oxytocin reduces anxiety and impacts on fear conditioning and extinction. Recently, oxytocin administration in humans was shown to increase trust, suggesting involvement of the amygdala, a central component of the neurocircuitry of fear and social cognition that has been linked to trust and highly expresses oxytocin receptors in many mammals. However, no human data on the effects of this peptide on brain function were available. Here, we show that human amygdala function is strongly modulated by oxytocin. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to image amygdala activation by fear-inducing visual stimuli in 15 healthy males after double-blind crossover intranasal application of placebo or oxytocin. Compared with placebo, oxytocin potently reduced activation of the amygdala and reduced coupling of the amygdala to brainstem regions implicated in autonomic and behavioral manifestations of fear. Our results indicate a neural mechanism for the effects of oxytocin in social cognition in the human brain and provide a methodology and rationale for exploring therapeutic strategies in disorders in which abnormal amygdala function has been implicated, such as social phobia or autism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16339042,N,medicated,,,

Laboratory animal studies indicate that the amygdala both receives sensory information and produces learned behavioral and autonomic fear responses. However, prior functional imaging research in humans has largely focused on amygdala activity elicited by fearful stimuli, giving less attention to this region's role in the production of fear responses. In contrast, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the amygdala's influence on the generation of conditional fear responses. Significant increases in amygdala activity were observed during the production of conditioned (learning-related), but not orienting, nonspecific, and unconditioned (nonlearning-related) skin conductance responses. Further, greater amygdala activity was demonstrated during conditioned response production than during conditioned stimulus presentation. These results suggest the amygdala not only responds to fearful stimuli, but also generates learning-related changes in human autonomic fear expression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15961053,Y,corr,uns,,

The aim of this preliminary study was to observe the effect of tumor resection on BOLD fMRI of the auditory and motor cortices. METHODS: Seven patients with gliomas underwent preoperative and early postoperative BOLD fMRI, and five of them underwent additional late postoperative BOLD fMRI. The auditory and motor cortices were localized with activation studies. A hemispheric activation index was used to quantify the relative extent of BOLD activation. RESULTS: The resection of a glioma with preoperative edema resulted in an increase from the preoperative to the early postoperative fMRI on auditory BOLD activation on the side of the tumor compared with the contralateral side. The same phenomenon was observed in one patient with motor BOLD activation. However, when no preoperative edema was present, a transient decrease in relative auditory BOLD activation was found. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the resection of a glioma with preoperative edema affecting the auditory and/or motor cortex may cause a transient increase in the BOLD response ipsilateral to the tumor. It seems that when the tumor is resected, the pressure on the brain, specifically on the affected auditory and/or motor cortex, decreases and the functional cortex becomes more easily detectable in BOLD fMRI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16094153,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2005 Jul 7.","Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is typically reduced during stable non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep compared with the waking level. It is not known when in the sleep cycle these changes occur. However, spontaneous fluctuations in alpha and theta rhythm during sleep onset are associated with marked changes in cardio-respiratory control. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that changes in CBF would occur during sleep onset and would be related to changes in cortical activity. Middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV) was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, as an index of CBF, in 10 healthy subjects. Sleep state, ventilation, end tidal carbon dioxide (PET,CO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and cardiac R-R interval (RR) were monitored simultaneously. Immediately following the transition from alpha to theta rhythm (the transition from wake to sleep), ventilation decreased by 13.4% and tidal volume (VT) by 12.2% (P<0.01); PET,CO2 increased by 1.9% (P<0.01); respiratory frequency (fR) and SaO2 did not change significantly. MCAV increased by 9.7% (P<0.01); MABP decreased by 3.2% (P<0.01) but RR did not change significantly. Immediately following the transition from theta to alpha rhythm (spontaneous awakening), increased by 13.3% (P<0.01); VT increased by 11.4% (P<0.01); PET,CO2 decreased by 1.9% (P<0.01); MCAV decreased by 11.1% (P<0.01) and MABP decreased by 7.5%; fR, SaO2 and RR did not change significantly. These changes in MCAV during sleep onset cannot be attributed to changes in ventilation or MABP. We speculate that the changes in cerebral vascular tone during sleep onset are mediated neurally, by regulatory mechanisms linked to the changes in cortical state, and that these mechanisms are different from those regulating the longer-term reduction in CBF associated with stable non-REM sleep.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16002438,N,no corr,,,

Intravenous administration of cocaine (20 mg/70 kg) activated mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic projection regions and showed temporal positive or negative BOLD responses. These results obtained from human cocaine users supported the involvement of the dopaminergic pathway in cocaine addiction from animal models. In addition, the cocaine administration also induced activations in the hierarchical brain networks in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) of the Brodmann area 10 (BA10) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).

METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional connectivity analyses were used to assess interregional brain activity covariations during script-driven imagery in PTSD subjects with a dissociative response, PTSD subjects with a flashback response, and healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Significant between-group differences in functional connectivity were found. Comparing dissociated PTSD patients and control subjects' connectivity maps in the left ventrolateral thalamus (VLT) [-14, -16, 4] revealed that control subjects had higher covariations between activations in VLT and in the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann's area [BA] 10), right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 30), and right superior occipital gyrus (BA 19, 39), whereas greater covariation with VLT in dissociated PTSD subjects occurred in the right insula (BA 13, 34), left parietal lobe (BA 7), right middle frontal gyrus (BA 8), superior temporal gyrus (BA 38, 34), and right cuneus (BA 19). Comparing dissociated PTSD and flashback PTSD connectivity maps in the right cingulate gyrus [3, 16, 30] revealed that dissociated PTSD subjects had higher covariations between activations in this region and the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47). CONCLUSIONS: Greater activation of neural networks involved in representing bodily states was seen in dissociated PTSD subjects than in non-PTSD control subjects.

An associative memory model predicts that this 'mood congruent' facilitation is due to the mood-related reactivation at retrieval of emotional responses which were linked to valenced information at encoding. To test this model, we presented subjects with positive and negative words at study and manipulated their mood at test while using functional imaging to monitor brain activity. Subjective mood ratings and heart rate variability both indicated that the manipulation was effective, and memory performance showed a strong trend towards facilitation in congruent conditions. In the functional imaging data, valence-specific conjunctions between encoding activity predicting subsequent memory in a congruent mood and retrieval activity relating to mood congruent recollection revealed shared responses in subgenual cingulate for positive valence and posteriolateral orbitofrontal cortex for negative valence, thus supporting the associative model. To elucidate the mnemonic basis of facilitation, independent of valence, we examined the shared correlates of positive and negative congruence and found that parts of the episodic memory system were activated by congruence in correct rejection trials, but no part of this system was activated by congruence in correctly remembered trials. This pattern suggests that mood congruent facilitation occurs at the level of attempted recall rather than that of successful recollection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15850739,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2005 Apr 28.","RATIONALE: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor function is hypothesised to be reduced in alcohol dependence. OBJECTIVES: We used positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]flumazenil, a non-selective tracer for brain GABA-benzodiazepine (GABA-BDZ) receptor binding, to determine in vivo the relationship between BDZ receptor occupancy by an agonist, midazolam, and its functional effects. METHODS: Abstinent male alcohol dependent subjects underwent [11C]flumazenil PET to measure occupancy of BDZ receptors by midazolam whilst recording its pharmacodynamic effects on behavioural and physiological measures. Rate constants describing the exchange of [11C]flumazenil between the plasma and brain compartments were derived from time activity curves. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in electroencephalography (EEG)-measured sleep time was seen in the alcohol dependent group despite the same degree of occupancy by midazolam as seen in the control group. The effects of midazolam on other measures of benzodiazepine receptor function, increasing EEG beta1 power and slowing of saccadic eye movements, were similar in the two groups. No differences in midazolam or flumazenil metabolism were found between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study suggests that alcohol dependence in man is associated with a reduced EEG sleep response to the benzodiazepine agonist, midazolam, which is not explained by reduced BDZ receptor occupancy, and is consistent with reduced sensitivity in this measure of GABA-BDZ receptor function in alcohol dependence. The lack of change in other functional measures may reflect a differential involvement of particular subtypes of the GABA-BDZ receptor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15864554,N,no phys of interest,,,

In our previous research, we found that different breathing rate could redistribute the proportion of systemic circulation, and also observed that the slower the breathing rate the more proportion of cerebral circulation appeared on head. In this paper, we further examined the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) signal fluctuations in brain stem among different breathing rate by the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex.

We tested the hypothesis that changes in arterial blood pressure (ABP) and arterial Pco(2) also take place during brain activation protocols designed to induce hemispheric lateralization, leading to a pressure-autoregulatory response in addition to the metabolic-driven changes usually assumed by brain stimulation paradigms. Continuous recordings of cerebral blood flow velocity [CBFV; bilateral, middle cerebral artery (MCA)], ABP, ECG, and end-tidal Pco(2) (Pet(CO(2))) were performed in 15 right-handed healthy subjects (aged 21-43 yr), in the seated position, at rest and during 10 repeated presentations of a word generation and a constructional puzzle paradigm that are known to induce differential cortical activation. Derived variables included heart rate, cerebrovascular resistance, critical closing pressure, resistance area product, and the difference between the right and left MCA recordings (CBFV(R-L)). No adaptation of the CBFV(R-L) difference was detected for the repeated presentation of 10 activation tasks, for either paradigm. During activation with the word generation tasks, CBFV changed by (mean +/- SD) 9.0 +/- 3.7% (right MCA, P = 0.0007) and by 12.3 +/- 7.6% (left MCA, P = 0.0007), ABP by 7.7 +/- 6.0 mmHg (P = 0.0007), heart rate by 7.1 +/- 5.3 beats/min (P = 0.0008), and Pet(CO(2)) by -2.32 +/- 2.23 Torr (P = 0.002). For the puzzle paradigm, CBFV changed by 13.9 +/- 6.6% (right MCA, P = 0.0007) and by 11.5 +/- 6.2% (left MCA, P = 0.0007), ABP by 7.1 +/- 8.4 mmHg (P = 0.0054), heart rate by 7.9 +/- 4.6 beats/min (P = 0.0008), and Pet(CO(2)) by -2.42 +/- 2.59 Torr (P = 0.001). The word paradigm led to greater left hemispheric dominance than the right hemispheric dominance observed with the puzzle paradigm (P = 0.004). We concluded that significant changes in ABP and Pet(CO(2)) levels occur during brain activation protocols, and these contribute to the evoked change in CBFV. A pressure-autoregulatory response can be observed in addition to the hemodynamic changes induced by increases in metabolic demand. Simultaneous changes in Pco(2) and heart rate add to the complexity of the response, indicating the need for more detailed modeling and better understanding of brain activation paradigms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15677522,N,no corr,,,

Understanding of its cognition-enhancing effects and the neurobiological mechanisms involved, especially in elderly people, is currently incomplete. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between MPH plasma levels and brain activation during visuospatial attention and movement preparation. METHODS: Twelve healthy elderly volunteers were scanned twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after oral administration of MPH 20 mg or placebo in a within-subject design. The cognitive paradigm was a four-choice reaction time task presented at two levels of difficulty (with and without spatial cue). Plasma MPH levels were measured at six time points between 30 and 205 min after dosing. FMRI data were analysed using a linear model to estimate physiological response to the task and nonparametric permutation tests for inference. RESULTS: Lateral premotor and medial posterior parietal cortical activation was increased by MPH, on average, over both levels of task difficulty. There was considerable intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetics of MPH. Greater area under the plasma concentration-time curve was positively correlated with strength of activation in motor and premotor cortex, temporoparietal cortex and caudate nucleus during the difficult version of the task. CONCLUSION: This is the first pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study to find an association between plasma levels of MPH and its modulatory effects on brain activation measured using fMRI. The results suggest that catecholaminergic mechanisms may be important in brain adaptivity to task difficulty and in task-specific recruitment of spatial attention systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15830222,N,no corr,,,

This mechanism is complementary to the usual known feedback pathways such as skeletal muscle afferent signals. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in eight normal and three paraplegic subjects using positron emission tomography (PET) and oxygen-15-labeled water. Statistical parametric maps were calculated from the images comparing rest and handgrip. Paraplegics were also scanned during attempted foot lifting, a condition without sensory feedback. During activation tasks, heart rate and mean arterial pressure increased. PET activation responses (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) were found in the contralateral primary sensory-motor area, the supplementary motor area, ipsilateral cerebellum, and bilaterally in the insula. A conjunction analysis showing responses common to handgrip and attempted foot lifting revealed activation in the right central insula (P < 0.05, corrected) in concordance with the concept of a central command feed-forward hypothesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15849712,M,coords?,uns,,

In each patient, regional cerebral blood flow was measured by [O-15] labeled water positron emission tomography before and after the oral administration of losartan for 8 to 23 weeks. In 8 patients, the baseline regional cerebral blood flow measurement was followed by 1,000 mg of acetazolamide challenge to measure the cerebral perfusion reserve. Systemic blood pressures before and after treatment were 153.8 +/- 10.8/96.0 +/- 6.5 mmHg (systolic mean +/- SD/diastolic mean +/- SD) and 133.4 +/- 11.2/83.6 +/- 6.5 mmHg, respectively; this difference was significant.

The role of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in ocular motor behavior,Ann N Y Acad Sci,"Pierrot-Deseilligny, Ch,Muri, R M,Nyffeler, T,Milea, D,eng,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Apr;1039:239-51. doi: 10.1196/annals.1325.023.","The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in the preparation of saccadic eye movements. Lesion studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that the human DLPFC is located in area 46 of Brodmann. The DLPFC has direct connections with the main cortical ocular motor areas, that is with the frontal eye field (FEF) and the supplementary eye field (SEF) in the frontal lobe; with several (associative, attentional, and motor) areas in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), including the parietal eye field (PEF); with the cingulate eye field in the anterior cingulate cortex; and directly downstream with the superior colliculus in the brainstem. Lesion and fMRI studies using the antisaccade paradigm have shown that the DLPFC is involved in the inhibition of unwanted reflexive saccades (triggered toward the target by the PEF), whereas the triggering of correct intentional antisaccades (made in the direction opposite to the target) may depend mainly upon the FEF. The DLPFC also controls short-term spatial working memory involved in memory-guided saccades, as shown by lesion and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies. By contrast, medium-term spatial memory (after 25 s) may be controlled by the medial temporal cortex (MTC). Recently, TMS studies have suggested that the transmission of memorized information from the integrative parietal areas (PPC) to the MTC is performed via both an indirect pathway comprising the DLPFC (i.e., transmission in series) and a direct pathway bypassing the DLPFC (i.e., transmission in parallel). Furthermore, the DLPFC is involved in the preparation of predictive saccades (i.e., saccades made before the appearance of an expected target) and saccade sequences, and, therefore, also controls some aspects of temporal working memory. Lastly, the involvement of the DLPFC has recently been reported in tasks comprising a target selection or a directional decision to make for the forthcoming saccade. These different functions suggest that the DLPFC plays a major role in the decisional processes governing ocular motor behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15826978,N,no corr,,,

Participants were scanned while encoding and later retrieving associations between pairs of words (semantic RM) or associations between words and fonts (perceptual RM). Encoding success activity (ESA) was identified by comparing study-phase activity for items subsequently remembered (hits) versus forgotten (misses) and retrieval success activity (RSA) by comparing test-phase activity for hits versus misses. The study yielded three main sets of findings. First, ESA-RSA differences were found within the medial temporal lobes (MTLs) and within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Within the left MTL, ESA was greater in the anterior hippocampus, and RSA was greater in the posterior parahippocampal cortex/hippocampus. This finding is consistent with the notion of an encoding-retrieval gradient along the longitudinal MTL axis. Within the left PFC, ESA was greater in ventrolateral PFC, and RSA was greater in dorsolateral and anterior PFC. This is the first evidence of a dissociation in successful encoding and retrieval activity within left PFC. Second, consistent with the transfer-appropriate processing principle, some ESA regions were reactivated during RSA in a content-specific manner. For semantic RM, these regions included the left ventrolateral PFC, whereas for perceptual RM, they included occipitoparietal and right parahippocampal regions. Finally, only one region in the entire brain was associated with RM in general (i.e., for both semantic and perceptual ESA and RSA): the left hippocampus. This finding highlights the fundamental role of the hippocampus in RM.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15689557,N,no phys of interest,,,

To clarify this issue, our purpose was to map the regions where the response to VSS was related to plasma testosterone. Specific objectives were (i) to identify regions that respond differentially to VSS in untreated hypogonadal patients compared with healthy controls and (ii) to identify in hypogonadal patients the regions that respond differentially to VSS as a function of therapeutically induced increased testosterone levels. METHOD: In nine male hypogonadal patients, in the same patients under treatment, and in eight healthy males, we used Positron Emission Tomography to investigate responses of regional cerebral blood flow to VSS. Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to locate regions that demonstrated a differential response. RESULTS: Regions responding differentially both in untreated patients compared with controls and in untreated patients compared with themselves under treatment were the right orbitofrontal cortex, insula and claustrum, where the activation was higher in controls than in untreated patients and where activation increased under treatment, and the left inferior frontal gyrus, that demonstrated a deactivation only in controls and in patients under treatment.

Five subjects with normal corrected acuity were studied using positron emission tomography and the HO bolus technique. The dominant right eye viewed a laser speckle pattern (633 nm) whose direction and velocity of motion were determined by the refractive state of the eye. The speckle pattern was presented at a distance of 1.8 m (0.55 D). The non-dominant eye was patched. Subjects performed two tasks counterbalanced for order effects: (i) attempted fixation on the remembered target in darkness with the dominant eye open and 'fixating'; and (ii) voluntary reduction of the laser speckle flow during each alternate 20-s epoch when a convex +2.0 D lens was placed in front of the right eye causing the speckle pattern to move downwards at 3 degrees /s. Comparison of the condition of NVA with the condition of FIX indicated widespread occipital activation. Decreases in absolute regional cerebral blood flow occurred in the superior parietal cortex (BA 5), frontal cortex (BA 8 and 10) and within the postcentral/precentral gyrus (BA 1/2/3/4) bilaterally where deactivation clusters eclipsed the presumed neck and shoulder areas.

Identifying neural activity associated with stress and stress-induced cocaine craving is important in understanding the neurobiology of cocaine craving and relapse. METHOD: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were assessed in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session with healthy controls and treatment-engaged, abstinent, cocaine-dependent individuals (patients) as they participated in brief guided imagery and recall of three personal stress and three personal neutral situations. RESULTS: During stress, patients showed significantly less BOLD activation than controls in specific frontal and para-limbic regions, such as the anterior cingulate (AC) region, left hippocampal/parahippocampal region, right fusiform gyrus, and the right postcentral gyrus. On the other hand, patients had increased activity in the caudate and dorsal striatum region during stress, activation that was significantly associated with stress-induced cocaine craving ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Patients failed to activate AC and related circuits during stress, regions associated with control, and regulation of emotion and distress states. Instead, they exhibited greater craving-related activation in the dorsal striatum, a region related to reward pathways and part of the obsessive-compulsive circuitry. Such functional alterations in stress processing may underlie the stress-related vulnerability to cocaine relapse often observed in cocaine-dependent individuals in early recovery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16163517,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2005 Jun 9.","The amygdala is preferentially activated by facial expressions of fear. Right and left amygdala are hypothesized to play distinct, but complementary, roles that influence somatic and cognitive responses to facial expressions. Right amygdala activation is linked to autonomic arousal, and thus indirectly influences left hemisphere cognitive processing centres. Left amygdala activation is more closely associated with cognitive processing and differentiation of facial emotions. A double-dissociation between the functions of left and right amygdala is implied by lesion studies but supportive evidence is inconsistent, partly because patients with structural anteromedial temporal anomalies have experienced variable surgical procedures. A functional dissociation can be demonstrated between arousal and the cognitive appraisal of fearful faces in the condition of X-monosomy or Turner syndrome. Previous research found Turner syndrome women of normal verbal intelligence are seriously impaired in their ability cognitively to differentiate fearful from other facial expressions but they acquire fear conditioning normally, with enhanced autonomic responses. These findings supported the dissociation hypothesis, which was formally tested in a study of 12 X-monosomic and 12 control females who participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging during which simultaneous skin conductance recordings were acquired. Faces depicting fear or neutral emotions were presented to both case and control subjects in random order. Arousal to (fearful-neutral) faces was associated with transiently increased skin conductance responses and bilateral amygdala activation in both groups, but X-monosomic females had proportionately greater--and more persistent--right amygdala activation than controls. In both groups, cognitive accuracy correlated positively with differential activity of left fusiform gyrus. There was a significant correlation between the left fusiform and left medial amygdala activation only in normal females, and only in them did differential SCRs (to fearful-neutral faces) correlate positively with left fusiform responses. Arousal and cognitive appraisal functions of the amygdala can thus be functionally dissociated. X-monosomy selectively impairs explicit recognition of fearful faces in the presence of normal or enhanced autonomic reactivity, and is associated with a functional dissociation of activity in left amygdala and left fusiform gyrus. These findings imply X-linked genes are essential for binding somatic responses to the cognitive appraisal of emotional stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15947057,N,clinical,rand,,

Both TG and a normal control group were exposed to hedonically valenced visual and olfactory stimuli. In contrast with control subjects, facial EMG and electrodermal activity in TG did not differentiate among pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures. In addition, the controls reacted spontaneously with larger corrugator EMG activity and higher skin conductance to unpleasant odors. By contrast, the subjective feeling states (pleasure and arousal ratings) remained preserved in TG. The covariation between facial and self-report measures of negative valence was also a function of the nature of the olfactory task in the patient only.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), abnormalities in corticostriatal interactions are believed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Previously, we have reported that, in healthy subjects, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of motor cortex (MC) induces focal dopamine release in the ipsilateral putamen. In the present study, using [11C]raclopride PET, we sought to investigate early PD patients with evidence of unilateral motor symptoms. We measured in the putamen changes in extracellular dopamine concentration following rTMS (intensity, 90% of the resting motor threshold; frequency, 10 Hz) of the left and right MC. The main objective was to identify potential differences in corticostriatal dopamine release between the hemisphere associated with clear contralateral motor symptoms (symptomatic hemisphere) and the presymptomatic stage of the other hemisphere (asymptomatic hemisphere). Repetitive TMS of MC caused a binding reduction in the ipsilateral putamen of both hemispheres. In the symptomatic hemisphere, while the amount of TMS-induced dopamine release was, as expected, smaller, the size of the significant cluster of change in [11C]raclopride binding was, instead, 61.4% greater than in the asymptomatic hemisphere. This finding of a spatially enlarged area of dopamine release, following cortical stimulation, may represent a possible in vivo expression of a loss of functional segregation of cortical information to the striatum and an indirect evidence of abnormal corticostriatal transmission in early PD. This has potential implications for models of basal ganglia function in PD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16324129,N,no phys of interest,,,

This increase of activation is probably modulated by top-down processes, that are initiated in emotion processing structures, specifically the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex. In the present fMRI study, a differential fear conditioning paradigm was applied to investigate this assumed modulation. Hemodynamic responses towards a neutral visual stimulus (CS+) predicting an electrical stimulation (UCS) were compared with responses towards a neutral and unpaired stimulus (CS-). Thereby, particularly the time courses of neural responses were considered. Skin conductance measures were concurrently recorded. Our results show that the differentiation between CS+ and CS- within the amygdala and the extended visual cortex was accomplished during a late acquisition phase. In the orbitofrontal cortex the differentiation occurred at an earlier stage and was then sustained throughout acquisition. It is suggested that these altering activation patterns are reflecting different phases of learning, integrating the analyzed regions to varying degrees. Additionally, the results indicate that statistical analyses comprising a temporal variation of hemodynamic responses are more likely to detect amygdala activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15935259,N,no corr,,,

Therefore, we studied the effect of increased acoustic noise on fMRI during verbal working memory (WM) processing. The sound pressure level of scanner noise was increased by 12 dBA from ""Quiet"" to ""Loud"" echo planar imaging (EPI) scans by utilizing resonant vibration modes of the gradient coil. A WM paradigm with graded levels of task difficulty was used to further access WM load. Increased scanner noise produced increased BOLD responses (percent signal change) bilaterally in the cerebellum, inferior (IFG), medial (medFG), and superior (SFG) frontal, fusiform (FusG), and the lingual (LG) gyri, and decreased BOLD responses bilaterally in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and the putamen. This finding suggests greater recruitment of attention resources in these brain regions, probably to compensate for interference due to louder scanner noise. Increased working memory load increased the BOLD signals in IFG and the cerebellum, but decreased the BOLD signals in the putamen and the LG. These findings also support the idea that brain function requires additional attention resources under noisier conditions. Load- and acoustic-noise-related changes in BOLD responses correlated negatively in the WM network. This study demonstrates that MR noise affects brain activation pattern.

A concern with drugs that block (DAT) is their potential reinforcing effects and abuse liability. Using positron emission tomography (PET) we have shown that for DAT-blocking drugs to produce reinforcing effects they must induce >50% DAT blockade and the blockade has to be fast (within 15 minutes). This study measures the potency and kinetics for DAT blockade by radafaxine in human brain. METHODS: PET and [11C]cocaine were used to estimate DAT blockade at 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours after radafaxine (40 mg p.o.) in 8 controls. Plasma pharmacokinetics and behavioral and cardiovascular effects were measured in parallel. RESULTS: DAT blockade by radafaxine was slow, and at 1 hour, it was 11%. Peak blockade occurred at about 4 hours and was 22%. Blockade was long lasting: at 8 hours 17%, and at 24 hours 15%. Peak plasma concentration occurred about 4 to 8 hours. No behavioral or cardiovascular effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low potency of radafaxine in blocking DAT and its slow blockade suggests that it is unlikely to have reinforcing effects. This is consistent with preclinical studies showing no self-administration. This is the first utilization of PET to predict abuse liability of a new antidepressant in humans based on DAT occupancy and pharmacokinetics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15780851,N,pharma study,,,

Elicitation of stress was verified by self-report of stress and emotional state and measures of heart rate and salivary-cortisol level. The change in CBF induced by the stress task was positively correlated with subjective stress rating in the ventral right prefrontal cortex (RPFC) and left insula/putamen area. The ventral RPFC along with right insula/putamen and anterior cingulate showed sustained activation after task completion in subjects reporting a high stress level during arithmetic tasks. Additionally, variations of baseline CBF in the ventral RPFC and right orbitofrontal cortex were found to correlate with changes in salivary-cortisol level and heart rate caused by undergoing stress tasks. We further demonstrated that the observed right prefrontal activation could not be attributed to increased cognitive demand accompanying stress tasks and extended beyond neural pathways associated with negative emotions.

The condition allows examination of central responses to hyperoxia, which minimizes afferent traffic from peripheral chemoreceptors. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess blood oxygen level-dependent signals over the brain during a baseline and subsequent 2-min hyperoxia (100% O2) period in 14 CCHS and 15 control subjects. After partitioning gray matter and correcting for global effects, the images were analyzed using volume-of-interest time trends followed by repeated-measures ANOVA and conventional cluster analyses. Respiratory rates initially (first 20 s) fell in CCHS, but rose in control subjects; CCHS heart rate increased in the first minute, and then decreased in the second minute, as in controls, but with muted rise and extent of decline. Multiple sites within the cerebellum, midbrain, and pons responded similarly to the challenge in both groups. Response patterns differed early in the right amygdala, paralleling initial respiratory pattern deficits, and late in the right insula, concomitant with cardiac rate differences. Signals also differed between groups in the medial and anterior cingulate, hippocampus, head of caudate, and lentiform nuclei, as well as pontine and midbrain structures and regions within the superior temporal and inferior frontal cortical gyri. The findings emphasize that structures that can alter respiratory timing, such as the amygdala, and modulate sympathetic outflow, such as the right insula, are deficient in CCHS.

The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of these low-frequency respiration variations on both task activation fMRI studies and resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Unlike MR signal changes correlated with the breathing motion ( approximately 0.3 Hz), BOLD signal changes correlated with across-breath variations in respiratory volume ( approximately 0.03 Hz) appear localized to blood vessels and regions with high blood volume, such as gray matter, similar to changes seen in response to a breath-hold challenge. In addition, the respiration-variation-induced signal changes were found to coincide with many of the areas identified as part of the 'default mode' network, a set of brain regions hypothesized to be more active at rest. Regions could therefore be classified as being part of a resting network based on their similar respiration-induced changes rather than their synchronized neuronal activity. Monitoring and removing these respiration variations led to a significant improvement in the identification of task-related activation and deactivation and only slight differences in regions correlated with the posterior cingulate at rest. Regressing out global signal changes or cueing the subject to breathe at a constant rate and depth resulted in an improved spatial overlap between deactivations and resting-state correlations among areas that showed deactivation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16632379,N,methods paper,,,

Trials were classified on the basis of individual participants' SCRs. Significant amygdala responding was detected only during trials on which a signal both predicted shock and elicited significant conditional SCR.

We used [15O]-H2O positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 12 healthy women during a nonsexual resting state, clitorally induced orgasm, sexual clitoral stimulation (sexual arousal control) and imitation of orgasm (motor output control). Extracerebral markers of sexual performance and orgasm were rectal pressure variability (RPstd) and perceived level of sexual arousal (PSA). Sexual stimulation of the clitoris (compared to rest) significantly increased rCBF in the left secondary and right dorsal primary somatosensory cortex, providing the first account of neocortical processing of sexual clitoral information. In contrast, orgasm was mainly associated with profound rCBF decreases in the neocortex when compared with the control conditions (clitoral stimulation and imitation of orgasm), particularly in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus and anterior temporal pole. Significant positive correlations were found between RPstd and rCBF in the left deep cerebellar nuclei, and between PSA and rCBF in the ventral midbrain and right caudate nucleus. We propose that decreased blood flow in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex signifies behavioural disinhibition during orgasm in women, and that deactivation of the temporal lobe is directly related to high sexual arousal. In addition, the deep cerebellar nuclei may be involved in orgasm-specific muscle contractions while the involvement of the ventral midbrain and right caudate nucleus suggests a role for dopamine in female sexual arousal and orgasm.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156391,N,no corr,,,

In this study, we reanalyzed the fMRI data to statistically compare pain-elicited neuronal activation of both groups. RESULTS: Equally painful pressure stimulation resulted in a significantly lower increase of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of the LBP patients. The analysis further revealed a significantly higher increase of rCBF in LBP than in HC in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFK), elicited by these same stimuli.

In an identical context, we show that the observed pupil size was mirrored by the observers' own pupil size.

We demonstrated previously that neurons in the macaque supplementary eye field (SEF) reflect the rule of ocular baseball, a go/nogo task in which eye movements signal the rule-guided interpretation of the trajectory of a target. In ocular baseball, subjects must decide whether to pursue a moving spot target with an eye movement after discriminating whether the target will cross a distal, visible line segment. Here we identify cortical regions active during the ocular baseball task using event-related human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and concurrent eye-movement monitoring. Task-related activity was observed in the SEF, the frontal eye field (FEF), the superior parietal lobule (SPL), and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). The SPL and right VLPFC showed heightened activity only during ocular baseball, despite identical stimuli and oculomotor demands in the control task, implicating these areas in the decision process. Furthermore, the right VLPFC but not the SPL showed the greatest activation during the nogo decision trials. This suggests both a functional dissociation between these areas and a role for the right VLPFC in rule-guided inhibition of behavior. In the SEF and FEF, activity was similar for ocular baseball and a control eye-movement task. We propose that, although the SEF reflects the ocular baseball rule, both areas in humans are functionally closer to motor processing than the SPL and the right VLPFC.

Because mechanisms of oxygen transport from blood to brain are dependent on cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and oxygen partial pressure (pO2) values in intravascular (Piv) and extravascular (Pev) compartments, we implemented multimodal measurements of these parameters into a compartmental model of oxygen transport and metabolism (i.e., hemoglobin-bound oxygen, oxygen dissolved in plasma and tissue spaces, oxygen metabolized in the mitochondria). In the alpha-chloralose anesthetized rat brain, we used magnetic resonance (7.0 T) and fluorescence quenching methods to measure CMRO2 (2.5+/-1.0 micromol/g min), CBF (0.7+/-0.2 mL/g min), Piv (74+/-10 mm Hg), and Pev (16+/-5 mm Hg) to estimate the degree of oxygen efflux from the brain. In the axially distributed compartmental model, oxygen molecules in blood had two possible fates: enter the tissue space or remain in the same compartment; while in tissue there were three possible fates: enter the blood or the mitochondrial space, or remain in the same compartment. The multiparametric results indicate that the probability of unmetabolized (i.e., dissolved) oxygen molecules reentering the blood from the tissue is negligible and thus its inclusion may unnecessarily complicate calculations of CMRO2 for 15O-PET, 17O-NMR, and calibrated fMRI methods.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15973353,N ,no phys of interest,,,

The active driving subjects (n = 10) drove for 30 minutes on quiet normal roads with a few traffic signals. The passive driving subjects (n = 10) participated as passengers on the front seat. The control subjects (n = 10) remained seated in a lit room with their eyes open. Voxel-based t-statistics were applied using SPM2 to search brain activation among the subgroups mentioned above. RESULTS: Significant brain activation was detected during active driving in the primary and secondary visual cortices, primary sensorimotor areas, premotor area, parietal association area, cingulate gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus as well as in thalamus and cerebellum. The passive driving manifested a similar-looking activation pattern, lacking activations in the premotor area, cingulate and parahippocampal gyri and thalamus. Direct comparison of the active and passive driving conditions revealed activation in the cerebellum. CONCLUSION: The result of actual driving looked similar to that of simulated driving, suggesting that visual perception and visuomotor coordination were the main brain functions while driving. In terms of attention and autonomic arousal, however, it seems there was a significant difference between simulated and actual driving possibly due to risk of accidents.

There is debate as to what the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these strategies are. For example, it is unclear whether self-distraction and reappraisal, although distinct at a phenomenological level, are also mediated by distinct neural processes. This is partly because imaging studies on reappraisal and self-distraction have been performed in different emotional contexts and are difficult to compare. We have therefore investigated the neural correlates of self-distraction, as indexed by a thought suppression task, in an anticipatory anxiety paradigm previously employed by us to study reappraisal. Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We show that self-distraction recruits the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Based on a review of the existing data, we develop a process model of cognitive emotion regulation. The model posits that both self-distraction and reappraisal attenuate emotional reactions through replacement of emotional by neutral mental contents but achieve replacement in different ways. This is associated with a dependence of self-distraction on a left prefrontal production function, whereas reappraisal depends on a right prefrontal higher order monitoring process.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16859413,N,no corr,,,

Little is known about the effects of Fabry disease on peripheral artery function and structure. Therefore, we aimed to further characterize the peripheral vascular structural and functional changes in Fabry disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured structural and functional vascular parameters, including intima-media thickness (IMT) of brachial and carotid arteries and abdominal aorta, carotid and aortic compliance, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in 17 Fabry patients and 34 healthy controls matched for age, sex and smoking. Carotid IMT (0.64 +/- 0.15 vs 0.57 +/- 0.12 mm), brachial IMT (1.02 +/- 0.25 vs 0.74 +/- 0.18 mm), and aortic IMT (0.31 +/- 0.09 vs 0.26 +/- 0.04 mm) were significantly increased, and brachial FMD was significantly impaired (6.3 +/- 5.0 vs 9.7 +/- 3.9%) in Fabry patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05 in all comparisons after adjustments for age, LDL-cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure). No differences were observed in arterial compliance between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Fabry disease affects arterial function and structure by disturbing peripheral endothelial function and promoting intima-media thickening.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16906474,N,no phys of interest,,,

Fifteen never-medicated, first episode schizophrenia patients and 24 matched healthy individuals performed eye movement tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. For both visually guided saccade and smooth pursuit paradigms, schizophrenia patients demonstrated reduced activation in sensorimotor areas supporting eye movement control, including the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, and parietal and cingulate cortex. The same findings were observed for an oculomotor delayed response paradigm used to assess spatial working memory, during which schizophrenia patients also had reduced activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, only minimal group differences in activation were found during a manual motor task. These results suggest a system-level dysfunction of cortical sensorimotor regions supporting oculomotor function, as well as in areas of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that support spatial working memory. These findings indicate that a generalized rather than localized pattern of neocortical dysfunction is present early in the course of schizophrenia and is related to deficits in the sensorimotor and cognitive control of eye movement activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571373,N,no corr,,,

Both stress and an alexithymic response to stress can contribute to relapse into drug abuse, but to our knowledge the neural processing of an alexithymic response to stress in cocaine-dependent individuals has not been examined. METHODS: In a functional magnetic resonance imaging session,17 male and 10 female abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects participated in script-guided imagery of neutral or stressful situations. Spatial preprocessing and statistical analysis of brain images were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping Software (SPM2). Blood oxygen level-dependent contrasts between stress and neutral imagery were correlated voxelwise with scores on the 26-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). RESULTS: Male cocaine users demonstrated a positive correlation between TAS scores and activation in the right putamen and middle frontal cortex during stressful, compared with neutral, imagery. In contrast, no brain regions showed a negative correlation with TAS scores. Female subjects demonstrated a negative correlation between TAS scores and activation in the right amygdala, thalamus, putamen, and left frontal and bilateral temporal cortices, and no positive correlations with TAS scores during stressful, compared with neutral, imagery. CONCLUSIONS: Women with greater alexithymic features showed reduced left-hemispheric cortical and right-hemispheric subcortical activation during processing of stress. However, men showed an opposite correlation in the right frontal cortex and putamen, suggesting that responses to stress in the putamen (activation v. deactivation) and frontal cortex (activation v. deactivation, as well as right v. left correlations) are critically different in association with alexithymia between male and female cocaine-dependent patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16575427,N,no corr,,,

We have successfully used a cue exposure paradigm with functional neuro-imaging (H2 15O PET; PET, positron emission tomography) in abstinent opiate addicts. This study showed that salient cue exposure results in activation in the left anterior cingulate/mediofrontal cortex and elicited craving correlated with activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex. We therefore aimed to replicate this study in alcohol dependence to see if a similar pattern of neural activation occurred. We recruited six abstinent alcohol-dependent and six non-dependent subjects who each underwent a 12-run PET scan using H2 15O to measure changes in regional blood flow during exposure to an alcoholic drink or its visually matched non-alcoholic drink. Physiological data and subjective ratings were also recorded. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) was used to analyse the PET images. Compared with control subjects, abstinent alcohol-dependent subjects rated their alcohol craving higher at baseline and throughout the study, but there was no significant change in the scores in response to the cues in either group. SPM analysis across all subjects showed significant activation in the occipital cortex in response to the alcohol cue as compared with the neutral one. Analysis of the same regions that were activated in the opiate study, revealed significant increases in signal activation in the left medial prefrontal area, but only in abstinent alcohol-dependent subjects. In conclusion, in abstinent alcohol dependence we suggest that a simple cue exposure paradigm is not sufficiently powerful in functional imaging studies to determine the underlying neurobiology of subjective craving.

Epub 2005 Aug 25.","A maximal inspiratory breath hold (inspiratory capacity apnea) against a closed glottis evokes a large and sustained increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Because of its dependence on a high intrathoracic pressure, it has been suggested that this maneuver causes unloading of the low-pressure baroreceptors, known to increase MSNA. To determine the central origins of this sympathoexcitation, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to define the loci and time course of activation of different brain areas. We hypothesized that, as previously shown for the Valsalvsa maneuver, discrete but widespread regions of the brain would be involved. In 15 healthy human subjects, a series of 90 gradient echo echo-planar image sets was collected during three consecutive 40-s inspiratory capacity apneas using a 3-T scanner. Global signal intensity changes were calculated and subsequently removed by using a detrending technique, which eliminates the global signal component from each voxel's signal intensity change. Whole brain correlations between changes in signal intensity and the known pattern of MSNA during the maneuver were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and significant changes were determined by using a random-effects analysis procedure (P < 0.01, uncorrected). Significant signal increases emerged in multiple areas, including the rostral lateral medulla, cerebellar nuclei, anterior insula, dorsomedial hypothalamus, anterior cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortexes. Decreases in signal intensity occurred in the dorsomedial and caudal lateral medulla, cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Given that many of these sites have roles in cardiovascular control, the sustained increase in MSNA during an inspiratory capacity apnea is likely to originate from a distributed set of discrete areas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16123207,N,no corr,,,

The present fMRI study aims to improve upon such methodological limitations to allow investigation of the cortical representation of flavour (taste and aroma combination) as it typically occurs during the consumption of liquid foods. For this purpose we used (1) a novel, automated, sprayed stimulus delivery system and a larger volume of liquid sample (containing sweet tastants and banana/pear aroma volatiles) to achieve more extensive stimulation of the oral cavity taste receptors, (2) a pseudo-natural delivery paradigm that included prompt swallowing after each sample delivery to obtain physiological retro-nasal olfactory stimulation, (3) fMRI acquisition with wide brain coverage and double-echo EPI to improve sensitivity. We validated our paradigm for the delivery of volatiles using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry. This showed that the main retro-nasal delivery of volatiles in the paradigm occurs immediately after the swallow.

In each session, electrocardiogram and gastric barostat measurements were conducted before and after a caloric liquid meal. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain scans were performed on a separate day. Analysis of autonomic function was accomplished through power spectral analysis of heart rate variability which revealed that the sympthovagal balance was significantly decreased after GES therapy, indicating a significant increase in vagal activity. Results from gastric barostat measurements demonstrated that during GES there was a significant increase in the discomfort threshold for both pressure and volume. Quantitative analysis of PET imaged cerebral activity showed that chronic GES increased thalamic activity. This study suggests that the symptomatic efficacy achieved by GES may be partly attributed to enhanced vagal autonomic function, decreasing gastric sensitivity to volume distention which simulates a postprandial adaptation and the activation of central control mechanisms for nausea and vomiting through thalamic pathways during GES.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17945898,N,clinical,,,

Emotional stimuli elicit changes in somatic (including autonomic) bodily states, which feedback to influence the expression of emotional feelings. In patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), this integration of emotion and bodily arousal is partially disrupted, impairing both efferent generation of sympathetic responses and afferent sensory feedback of visceral state via the spinal cord. A number of theoretical accounts of emotion predict emotional deficits in SCI patients, particularly at the level of emotional feelings, yet evidence for such a deficit is equivocal. We used functional MRI (fMRI) and a basic emotional learning paradigm to investigate the expression of emotion-related brain activity consequent upon SCI. We scanned seven SCI patients and seven healthy controls during an aversive fear conditioning task. Subjects viewed randomized presentations of four angry faces. One of the faces (CS + arm) was associated with delivery of electrical shock to the upper arm on 50% of trials. This shock was painful to all subjects. A face of the same gender acted as a 'safe' control stimulus (CS - arm). In both control subjects and SCI patients, painful cutaneous stimulation of the arm evoked enhanced activity within components of a central pain matrix, including dorsal anterior cingulate, right insula and medial temporal lobe. However, SCI patients differed from controls in conditioning-related brain activity. SCI patients showed a relative enhancement of activity within dorsal anterior cingulate, periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) and superior temporal gyrus. Conversely, SCI patients showed relative attenuation of activity in subgenual cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices to threat of painful arm stimulation (CS + arm > CS - arm). Our findings provide evidence for differences in emotion-related brain activity in SCI patients. We suggest that the observed functional abnormalities including enhanced anterior cingulate and PAG reflect central sensitization of the pain matrix, while decreased subgenual cingulate activity may represent a substrate underlying affective vulnerability in SCI patients consequent upon perturbation of autonomic control and afferent visceral representation. Together these observations may account for motivational and affective sequelae of SCI in some individuals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16330503,N,clinical,,,

The present study aimed to confirm prior findings and to extend them by identifying the frontal neural circuitry associated with regulation of peripheral physiological responses during voluntary emotion suppression. Ten healthy female subjects were presented with affectively positive, neutral, and negative pictures in each of an Attending and Suppression task. Regional cerebral blood-flow changes were measured using 15O-water positron emission tomography, and autonomic (heart rate: HR, skin conductance response: SCR) and endocrine (adrenocorticotropic hormone: ACTH) indices were measured during both tasks. The left amygdala and the right anterior temporal pole were activated during the Attending task, whereas activation was observed in the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), including the adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC) during the Suppression task. In the Attending task, activation in the amygdala and MOFC positively correlated with magnitudes of the SCR and ACTH responses. Emotion suppression elicited enhancement of SCR and the strength of the effect positively correlated with activation in the MOFC. These results suggest that the MOFC plays a pivotal role in top-down regulation of peripheral physiological responses accompanying emotional experiences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16249100,Y,corr,uns,,

Biochemical tests showed that the light massage (palm-pressure) reduced levels of stress-related serum cortisol and salivary stress protein chromogranin-A measured after the PET examination. Absolute rCBF significantly increased in the parietal cortex (precuneus) under the prone condition compared with the supine condition, and this rCBF increase was in parallel with comfortable sensation and slowing heart rate during the massage. Correlation analysis in statistical parametric mapping showed that the amygdalar and basal forebrain rCBF correlated with parasympathetic function (heart rate reduction), indicating involvement of the forebrain-amygdala system in mediating activities in the autonomic nervous system in the presence of comfortable sensation. To conclude, prone posture itself can stimulate the precuneus region to raise awareness, and the light massage on the back may help accommodate the brain to comfortable stimulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16973270,N,no coords,,,

Epub 2005 Oct 6.",BACKGROUND: In vivo determination of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) occupancy by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) using positron emission tomography (PET) can aid in determination of dosing. Previous studies used chronic SSRI administration that may down-regulate 5-HTT and used the cerebellum as reference region despite measurable 5-HTT. We examine the reference region and occupancy after acute sertraline dosing. METHODS: We conducted autoradiography of human postmortem cerebellum to determine an optimal reference region. We quantified 5-HTT binding using [(11)C]DASB and arterial input functions in 17 healthy volunteers. Baseline PET scans were followed by a scan 4-6 days after 25 mg to 100mg of daily sertraline. Several modeling methods and outcome measures were assessed. RESULTS: Cerebellar gray matter is the optimal reference region. Occupation of 5-HTT sites saturates at low plasma sertraline levels (K(D) = 1.9 ng/ml) with maximal occupancies of 106.8 +/- 8.3% across all brain regions. There is a weak correlation between oral sertraline and plasma sertraline. Occupancy measures vary based on the reference region and outcome measure used. CONCLUSIONS: Occupancy studies and postmortem autoradiography can help define the optimal reference region. Reference tissue modeling using the optimal reference region returns the same occupancy measures as those determined using an arterial input function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16213473,N,pharma study,,,

However, the relationship between activity in these regions and general emotional processing unrelated to traumatic experience has not been fully examined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate activity in the limbic and paralimbic brain regions in PTSD in response to a challenge with emotionally salient generic visual images. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-control study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen Vietnam veterans with combat-related PTSD (PTSD group), 15 combat-exposed Vietnam veterans without PTSD (combat control group), and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (normal control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used positron emission tomography to study regional cerebral blood flow while participants viewed complex visual pictures with negatively valenced/aversive, nonaversive (""neutral""), and blank pictures. Psychophysiologic and emotional self-report data were also recorded. RESULTS: All 3 groups activated the dorsal MPFC to general salient content. Controls without PTSD activated the left amygdala in response to aversive stimuli. Normal controls activated the ventral MPFC and combat-exposed non-PTSD and PTSD participants exhibited either no response or deactivation in these regions, respectively, during negative emotional experience. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models, patients with PTSD exhibited altered neural responses in the amygdala and ventral MPFC during the processing of emotionally salient but trauma-unrelated stimuli, potentially reflecting disorder-specific changes. Activation of the amygdala and lack of ventral MPFC deactivation to negatively valenced images in combat controls may reflect compensatory changes after trauma exposure that are not associated with PTSD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16461862,N,no corr,,,

Alternately, it may be an acquired PTSD sign, that is, it may have developed after the traumatic exposure, along with the PTSD. We have studied pairs of Vietnam combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed, identical twins in an effort to resolve these competing origins. Combat veterans were diagnosed as current PTSD or non-PTSD (i.e., never had). Average heart rate responses (HRRs) to a series of sudden, loud-tone presentations were larger in Vietnam combat veteran twins with PTSD, but these larger responses were not shared by their noncombat-exposed cotwins, whose responses were similar to those of the non-PTSD combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed cotwins. These results suggest that larger HRRs to sudden, loud tones represent an acquired sign of PTSD. In contrast, increased neurological soft signs (NSSs), diminished hippocampal volume, and presence of abnormal cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) were found in Vietnam combat veteran twins with PTSD and their ""high-risk,"" unexposed cotwins compared to Vietnam combat veteran twins without PTSD and their ""low-risk,"" unexposed cotwins.

Many studies have failed to resolve whether healthy first-degree relatives share the same deficit. Measures of brain activity may be more sensitive than behavioral measures. In patients, the saccadic inhibition deficit has been related to impaired frontostriatal functioning. This study attempts to establish whether this abnormality is also present in unaffected relatives of patients. METHODS: Functional brain images were acquired during prosaccades and antisaccades in 16 control subjects and 16 unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design. Eye movements were measured during scanning. RESULTS: The task activated a network of regions corresponding to the oculomotor system. Siblings and control subjects did not differ during execution of prosaccades. During antisaccades, siblings did not activate the caudate nucleus. Siblings and control subjects did not differ on the percentage of antisaccade errors. CONCLUSIONS: Siblings did not appropriately activate the striatum during antisaccades, similar to what has been reported in patients. Siblings, however, did not make significantly more errors during antisaccades, indicating that they were able to compensate for the inactive caudate.

We tested whether these DIS show different psychobiological reactions to trauma-related memory. METHODS: A symptom provocation paradigm with 11 DID patients was used in a two-by-two factorial design setting. Both NIS and TIS were exposed to a neutral and a trauma-related memory script. Three psychobiological parameters were tested: subjective ratings (emotional and sensori-motor), cardiovascular responses (heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability) and regional cerebral blood flow as determined with H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Psychobiological differences were found for the different DIS. Subjective and cardiovascular reactions revealed significant main and interactions effects. Regional cerebral blood flow data revealed different neural networks to be associated with different processing of the neutral and trauma-related memory script by NIS and TIS.

CCK-4 administration induced physiological and psychological symptoms of anxiety that met the criteria for a panic attack in 8 subjects, as well as cerebral activation in anxiety-related brain regions. Clinical and physiological response intensity was consistent with cerebral activity extent and robustness. fMRI proved more sensitive than clinical assessment in evidencing the effects of the AA challenge.

In animals, stress has often been reported to have opposing effects on memory and learning in males and females. In humans, the effects of cortisol have mainly been studied at the behavioral level. The aim of the present experiment was to characterize the effects of a single cortisol dose (30 mg) on the hemodynamic correlates of fear conditioning. In a double-blind group comparison study subjects (17 females and 17 males) received 30 mg cortisol or placebo orally before participating in a discriminative fear conditioning paradigm. Results revealed that cortisol impaired electrodermal signs of learning (the first interval response) in males, while no conditioned SCRs emerged for the females independent of treatment. fMRI results showed that cortisol reduced activity for the CS+ > CS- comparison in the anterior cingulate, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex in males. Opposite findings (increase in these regions under cortisol) were detected in females. In addition, cortisol reduced the habituation in the CS+ > CS- contrast in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex independent of sex. Finally, cortisol also modified the response to the electric shock (the UCS) by enhancing the activity of the anterior as well as the posterior cingulate. In sum, these findings demonstrate that in humans cortisol mostly influences prefrontal brain activation during fear conditioning and that these effects appear to be modulated by sex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16839780,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2006 Jul 19.","BACKGROUND: Disgust and fear are basic emotions that have different elicitors and expressions, and that appear to be mediated by different neurocircuits. Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is classified as an anxiety disorder, disgust may be involved in its pathogenesis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of disgust-inducing visual stimuli in OCD have suggested disorder specific alterations in brain activation during these tasks. METHODS: Subjects with OCD and healthy controls (HC) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) brain scanning after injection of H(2) (15)O. During PET, subjects either watched slides designed to evoke feelings of disgust (OCD = 5, HC = 11), expected the delivery of an electrical shock (OCD = 11, HC = 13), or rested (OCD = 11, HC = 14). After the anticipatory anxiety and resting tasks, anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal measures were obtained. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to analyze regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data. RESULTS: Comparison of OCD subjects with controls on differences in rCBF across the disgust-inducing and resting tasks showed that OCD was characterized by greater rCBF in the left insula. In OCD the disgust-inducing task increased right lateral orbitofrontal cortex rCBF compared to resting, whereas in controls there was no difference in rCBF between these tasks. Anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal activity increased during anticipatory anxiety in both groups, and comparison of rCBF in OCD subjects with controls in anticipatory anxiety versus resting state also found no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: OCD may be characterized by a disruption in disgust processing, such that there is a decrease in appropriate disgust (such as that evoked by observing disgust in others) and an increase in inappropriate disgust (such as that evoked by contamination stimuli). The insula may play a particularly important role in mediating such putative disruptions. The sample studied here was small, and further work is required to determine whether disgust-induced activation patterns in OCD are more apparent in specific subtypes of this disorder, whether they are specific to OCD, and whether they are normalized by treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16850255,N,no corr,,,

Of two geometric figures, the paired conditioned stimulus (CS+) predicted an electrical stimulus (unconditioned stimulus = UCS), whereas the unpaired conditioned stimulus (CS-) was not followed by the UCS. Awareness of stimulus contingencies was manipulated experimentally, creating an aware and an unaware group: a distracter figure and a working memory task were introduced to conceal the stimulus contingencies of the conditioning paradigm, hence preventing contingency detection in the unaware group. The aware group was informed beforehand about the relation between CS+, CS-, and UCS. Differential SCRs were only obtained in the aware but not in the unaware group. Conversely, we observed enhanced responses of the amygdala, the orbitofrontal, and the occipital cortex to the CS+ in the unaware group only. Thus, we found a dissociation of SCR differentiation and the activation of a neural fear network depending on the presence or absence of awareness. These results support a model of fear conditioning that distinguishes between a more cognitive level of learning, reflected in contingency awareness and differential SCRs, and the awareness independent activation of a fear network.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16651009,N,no corr,,,

The goal of this study was to assess whether intravenous (i.v.) insulin followed by FDG injection 60 minutes later could decrease the blood glucose level of hyperglycemic patients without altering muscular, liver, or lung FDG uptake. METHODS: We evaluated 53 diabetic patients with a fasting glycemia higher than 7.0 mmol/l. The control group consisted of 53 nondiabetic patients with a normal fasting glycemia. Sixty minutes before FDG injection, all diabetic patients received up to two intravenous bolus of insulin. Regions of interest were drawn over the lungs, heart, liver, skeletal muscles, and over the most active lung nodule, if present, to calculate a standardized uptake value (SUV) normalized to the lean body weight. RESULTS: After one or two boluses of insulin (mean 3.4 units), 39 diabetic patients decreased their blood glucose level from 9.4 +/- 1.8 to 6.1 +/- 1.3 mmol/l. In 14 patients, two doses of insulin (mean 4.5 +/- 2.3 units) were not sufficient, but managed to decrease the blood glucose level from 10.6 +/- 2.1 to 9.1 +/- 2.1 mmol/l. There was no significant difference for the SUV calculated on the lung, liver, heart, and skeletal muscles. No differences were noted in lung tumor uptake in patients who received insulin compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: With a sufficient waiting period between the insulin and FDG injections, an i.v. bolus of insulin makes it possible to effectively decrease glycemia of diabetic patients without increasing muscular FDG uptake.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17053859,N,no phys of interest,,,

The present study aimed at exploring the effects of a pharmacological manipulation (betablockade) on sAA in the context of a stressful fMRI experiment on emotional information processing. Thirty young healthy subjects participated in a double blind group comparison study and received 80 mg of the betablocker (BB) propranolol or a placebo (PL). Salivary samples were obtained before and 90 min (pre-scan) and 135 min (post-scan) after drug application. In addition heart rate and blood pressure were assessed. During rest a significant drug by time interaction was observed, lowering sAA levels as well as heart rate and systolic blood pressure in the betablocker treatment group. During the scanning procedure, in which participants were confronted with highly negative emotional pictures, the significant increase in sAA levels in the PL group compared to the BB group persisted. No additional change was noticed in heart rate or blood pressure during scanning in the PL or BB group. The current pharmacological study in the human provides direct evidence for the sensitivity of sAA to changes in adrenergic activation, specifically in reaction to psychological stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16046076,N,no phys of interest,,,

Here, we evaluate the effects of expectation on the responses to intravenous methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) in fifteen subjects who had minimal experience with stimulant drugs. We used positron emission tomography to measure brain glucose metabolism, which we used as a marker of brain function and tested them under four randomized conditions (1) expecting placebo and receiving placebo; (2) expecting placebo and receiving methylphenidate; (3) expecting methylphenidate and receiving methylphenidate; (4) expecting methylphenidate and receiving placebo. We show that methylphenidate-induced decreases in striatum were greater when subjects expected to receive methylphenidate than when they were not expecting it. We also show that the subjects' expectations affected their responses to placebo. That is, when subjects expected to receive methylphenidate but received placebo there were significant increases in ventral cingulate gyrus (BA 25) and nucleus accumbens (regions involved with emotional reactivity and reward). The effect was largest in subjects who, because of experimental randomization, had not experienced methylphenidate. Because subjects were told that methylphenidate could be experienced as pleasant, unpleasant or devoid of subjective effects these results suggest the involvement of the ventral cingulate and of the nucleus accumbens in processing expectation for ""uncertain drug effects"". Thus, the state of expectation needs to be considered as a variable modulating the reinforcing and therapeutic effects of drugs even in subjects who have no prior experience with the drug.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757181,N,no phys of interest,,,

Knowledge of the IRF, obtained during the same experiment, or as the result of a separate experiment, can be used to dynamically obtain an estimate of the input stimulus function. Reconstruction of the input stimulus function allows the fMRI experiment to be evaluated as a communication system. The input stimulus function may be considered as a ""message"" which is being transmitted over a noisy ""channel"", where the ""channel"" is characterized by the voxel IRF. Following reconstruction of the input stimulus function, the received message is compared with the transmitted message on a voxel-by-voxel basis to determine the transmission error rate.

Humans may have evolved specialized neural systems for responding to fear in the absence of conscious stimulus detection. We used functional neuroimaging to establish whether the amygdala and the medial prefrontal regions to which it projects are engaged by subliminal fearful faces and whether responses to subliminal fear are distinguished from those to supraliminal fear. We also examined the time course of amygdala-medial prefrontal responses to supraliminal and subliminal fear. Stimuli were fearful and neutral baseline faces, presented under subliminal (16.7 ms and masked) or supraliminal (500 ms) conditions. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) were recorded simultaneously as an objective index of fear perception. SPM2 was used to undertake search region-of-interest (ROI) analyses for the amygdala and medial prefrontal (including anterior cingulate) cortex, and complementary whole-brain analyses. Time series data were extracted from ROIs to examine activity across early versus late phases of the experiment. SCRs and amygdala activity were enhanced in response to both subliminal and supraliminal fear perception. Time series analysis showed a trend toward greater right amygdala responses to subliminal fear, but left-sided responses to supraliminal fear. Cortically, subliminal fear was distinguished by right ventral anterior cingulate activity and supraliminal fear by dorsal anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal activity. Although subcortical amygdala activity was relatively persistent for subliminal fear, supraliminal fear showed more sustained cortical activity. The findings suggest that preverbal processing of fear may occur via a direct rostral-ventral amygdala pathway without the need for conscious surveillance, whereas elaboration of consciously attended signals of fear may rely on higher-order processing within a dorsal cortico-amygdala pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16281289,N,no corr,,,

Although the striatum and its dopaminergic inputs respond to a variety of stimuli categorically defined as salient, including rewards, the relationship between striatal activity and saliency is not well understood. Specifically, it is unclear if the striatum responds in an all-or-none fashion to salient events or instead responds in a graded fashion to the degree of saliency associated with an event. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured activity in the brains of 20 participants performing a visual classification task in which they identified single digits as odd or even numbers. An auditory tone preceded each number, which was occasionally, and unexpectedly, substituted by a novel sound. The novel sounds varied in their ability to interrupt and reallocate cognitive resources (i.e., their saliency) as measured by a delay in reaction time to immediately subsequent numerical task-stimuli. The present findings demonstrate that striatal activity increases proportionally to the degree to which an unexpected novel sound interferes with the current cognitive focus, even in the absence of reward. These results suggest that activity in the human striatum reflects the level of saliency associated with a stimulus, perhaps providing a signal to reallocate limited resources to important events.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16153860,N,no corr,,,

This is potentially very powerful, but rests on the assumption that the ST variability observed in EEG is reflected in the fMRI signal. The current study investigated this assumption and compared two different data processing strategies for each modality. Five subjects underwent separate EEG and fMRI sessions with checkerboard stimuli at two contrasts. EEG data were preprocessed using wavelet denoising and independent component analysis (ICA), whilst the general linear model and ICA were used for fMRI. Amplitudes and latencies of the P1 and N2 components of the visual evoked potential (VEP) were calculated for each trial. For fMRI, the amplitudes and latencies of the ST haemodynamic responses (HR) were calculated. Within modality, the results for the two processing methods were significantly correlated in the majority of data sets. Across modality, the average amplitudes of the VEPs and HRs were also significantly correlated. Examination of ST variability demonstrated that the amplitudes of the mean VEPs and HRs are both influenced by the latency variability of the ST responses to a greater extent than the amplitude variability. For high contrast stimuli the latency variability in EEG and fMRI was significantly correlated, with a similar trend seen for the low contrast stimuli. The results confirm the validity of examining both the EEG and fMRI signals on an ST basis and suggest an underlying neuronal origin in both modalities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17826182,N,no corr,,,

METHODS: Resting-state PET scans collected at years 1, 3, 5, and 7 were used to determine differences in longitudinal patterns of rCBF change in HTNs relative to HCs. Pulse pressure, arterial pressure, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, and hypertension duration were also correlated with patterns of rCBF change in the HTN group. RESULTS: Relative to HCs, the HTN group shows greater rCBF decreases in prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and occipital areas over time, suggesting that these regions are more susceptible to hypertension-related dysfunction with advancing age. The HTN group also fails to show preservation of function over time in motor regions and in the temporal cortex and hippocampus as observed in HC. Although pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and systolic and diastolic pressure all correlate similarly with longitudinal rCBF changes, increased duration of hypertension is associated with decreased rCBF in prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas of functional vulnerability observed in the HTN group.

METHODS: Thirty-four healthy adult volunteers (17 women, all right-handed) were scanned while viewing alternating blocks of disgusting and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Using a partially-silent fMRI sequence, the participants rated their level of discomfort after each block of pictures. Skin conductance responses (SCR) were measured throughout the experiment.

RESULTS: Both women and men reported greater subjective discomfort and showed more SCR fluctuations during the disgusting picture blocks than during the neutral picture blocks. Women and men also demonstrated a similar pattern of brain response to disgusting compared with neutral pictures, showing activation in the anterior insula, ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, and visual regions. Compared with men, women had significantly higher disgust sensitivity scores, experienced more subjective discomfort, and demonstrated greater activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal regions. However, these differences were no longer significant when disgust sensitivity scores were controlled for.

Recent functional neuroimaging studies in humans have reported that activity in this region is closely related to the behavioral expression of conditional skin conductance responses (SCR). However, SCR waveforms following conditional stimulus (CS) presentation contain both early period and late period responses that may differ with respect to underlying central processes. It is not known whether amygdala activity corresponds to the expression of early conditional responses (CRs) that occur shortly following CS onset or late CRs that closely precede UCS onset. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and concurrent skin conductance measurements to determine whether amygdala activity is more closely related to the expression of early or late period CRs. Increased amygdala activity was detected during the formation of early, but not late period CRs. Additionally, this pattern of amygdala activity did not dissipate, but persisted into late stages of the experiment.

Cognitive models of depression highlight an over-representation of negative thoughts and memories, with depressed individuals showing memory facilitation for negative material. We hypothesized that the antidepressant action of VNS may emerge through corrective influences on 'negativity bias' in memory. We therefore examined the impact of VNS on emotional memory and its underlying brain activity. METHODS: We tested a single patient undergoing VNS for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Stimulation was set at a 30/66-second on/off cycle during three encoding blocks when the patient viewed randomly presented positive, negative, and neutral words. Following each block, VNS was switched off and the patient identified previously seen words from distractors in a subsequent recognition memory task. The patient was scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the first encoding block. RESULTS: There was robust recall of negative material viewed during 'off' cycles of VNS but subsequent memory of negative words was attenuated during active VNS ('on' cycles). VNS did not influence memory for neutral and positive words. With neuroimaging, direct modulatory effects of VNS were observed in dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and orbital regions of the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, during encoding of negative words, compared with positive and neutral words, VNS also modulated activity within orbitofrontal, ventromedial and polar prefrontal cortices, midcingulate cortex, and brain stem. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that VNS can interfere with memory of negative information, an effect that may contribute to its antidepressant role.

Using a decision task, hemodynamic responses to affective bursts, vegetative sounds, and vocal gestures were measured by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Affective bursts elicited activation of anterior left superior temporal gyrus. In contrast, arbitrary vocal gestures yielded hemodynamic reactions of the left temporo-parietal junction.

Several neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation found the amygdala to be a target for downregulation and prefrontal regions to be associated with downregulation. To characterize the role of prefrontal regions in bidirectional emotion regulation and to investigate regulatory influences on amygdala activity and peripheral physiological measures, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with simultaneous recording of self-report, startle eyeblink, and skin conductance responses was carried out. Subjects viewed threat-related pictures and were asked to up- and downregulate their emotional responses using reappraisal strategies. While startle eyeblink responses (in successful regulators) and skin conductance responses were amplified during upregulation, but showed no consistent effect during downregulation, amygdala activity was increased and decreased according to the regulation instructions. Trial-by-trial ratings of regulation success correlated positively with activity in amygdala during upregulation and orbitofrontal cortex during downregulation. Downregulation was characterized by left-hemispheric activation peaks in anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex and upregulation was characterized by a pattern of prefrontal activation not restricted to the left hemisphere. Further analyses showed significant overlap of prefrontal activation across both regulation conditions, possibly reflecting cognitive processes underlying both up- and downregulation, but also showed distinct activations in each condition. The present study demonstrates that amygdala responses to threat-related stimuli can be controlled through the use of cognitive strategies depending on recruitment of prefrontal areas, thereby changing the subject's affective state.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17133391,N,no corr,,,

Moreover, to date, no studies have investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms that translate experiences of social support into the health outcomes that follow. To investigate these processes, thirty participants completed three tasks in which daily social support, neurocognitive reactivity to a social stressor, and neuroendocrine responses to a social stressor were assessed. Individuals who interacted regularly with supportive individuals across a 10-day period showed diminished cortisol reactivity to a social stressor. Moreover, greater social support and diminished cortisol responses were associated with diminished activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and Brodmann's area (BA) 8, regions previously associated with the distress of social separation. Lastly, individual differences in dACC and BA 8 reactivity mediated the relationship between high daily social support and low cortisol reactivity, such that supported individuals showed reduced neurocognitive reactivity to social stressors, which in turn was associated with reduced neuroendocrine stress responses.

The scientifically best understood paradigm for the detection of deception, however, the guilty knowledge test (GKT), was rarely used in imaging studies. By transferring a GKT-paradigm to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, while additionally quantifying reaction times and skin conductance responses (SCRs), this study aimed at identifying the neural correlates of the behavioral and electrodermal response pattern typically found in GKT examinations. Prior to MR scanning, subjects viewed two specific items (probes) and were instructed to hide their knowledge of these. Two other specific items were designated as targets and required a different behavioral response during the experiment and eight items served as irrelevant stimuli. Reaction times and SCR amplitudes differed significantly between all three item types. The neuroimaging data revealed that right inferior frontal and mid-cingulate regions were more active for probe and target trials compared to irrelevants. Moreover, the differential activation in the right inferior frontal region was modulated by stimulus conflicts. These results were interpreted as an increased top-down influence on the stimulus-response-mapping for concealed and task-relevant items. Additionally, the influence of working memory and retrieval processes on this activation pattern is discussed. Using parametric analyses, reaction times and SCR amplitudes were found to be linearly related to activity in the cerebellum, the right inferior frontal cortex, and the supplementary motor area.

Six panic patients and seven normal control subjects underwent positron emission tomography with (18)F-deoxyglucose imaging after a single-blinded administration of either doxapram or a placebo saline solution. Saline and doxapram were administered on separate days in counterbalanced order. Patients showed a greater heart rate increase on doxapram relative to saline than controls, indicating differential response. On the saline placebo day, patients had greater prefrontal relative activity than controls. In response to doxapram, patients tended to decrease prefrontal activity more than controls, and increased cingulate gyrus and amygdala activity more than controls. This suggests that panic disorder patients activate frontal inhibitory centers less than controls, a tendency that may lower the threshold for panic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17560768,N,no corr,,,

Familial PD caused by mutation of the gene encoding alpha-synuclein or by alpha-synuclein gene triplication also features cardiac sympathetic denervation and baroreflex failure. METHODS: Here we report results of cardiac sympathetic neuroimaging by 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine PET, baroreflex testing based on beat-to-beat hemodynamic responses to the Valsalva maneuver, and nigrostriatal neuroimaging using 6-[(18)F] fluorodopa PET in a proband with mutation of the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the most common genetic abnormality identified so far in familial PD. RESULTS: The patient had no detectable 6-[(18)F] fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity in the left ventricular myocardium, a progressive fall in blood pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and no pressure overshoot after release of the maneuver, and decreased 6-[(18)F] fluorodopa-derived radioactivity bilaterally in the putamen and substantia nigra. CONCLUSION: This patient with Parkinson disease (PD) caused by LRRK2 mutation had evidence of cardiac sympathetic denervation, baroreflex-sympathoneural and baroreflex-cardiovagal failure, and nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency, a pattern resembling that in the sporadic disease. The results fit with the concept that in LRRK2 PD, parkinsonism, cardiac sympathetic denervation, and baroreflex failure can result from a common pathogenetic process.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17625107,N,clinical,,,

Two-level theories of emotion extend this model to suggest that cognitive interpretations of physiological changes shape self-reported emotions. Correspondingly false physiological feedback of evoked or tonic bodily responses can alter emotional attributions. Moreover, anxiety states are proposed to arise from detection of mismatch between actual and anticipated states of physiological arousal. However, the neural underpinnings of these phenomena previously have not been examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook a functional brain imaging (fMRI) experiment to investigate how both primary and second-order levels of physiological (viscerosensory) representation impact on the processing of external emotional cues. 12 participants were scanned while judging face stimuli during both exercise and non-exercise conditions in the context of true and false auditory feedback of tonic heart rate. We observed that the perceived emotional intensity/salience of neutral faces was enhanced by false feedback of increased heart rate. Regional changes in neural activity corresponding to this behavioural interaction were observed within included right anterior insula, bilateral mid insula, and amygdala. In addition, right anterior insula activity was enhanced during by asynchronous relative to synchronous cardiac feedback even with no change in perceived or actual heart rate suggesting this region serves as a comparator to detect physiological mismatches. Finally, BOLD activity within right anterior insula and amygdala predicted the corresponding changes in perceived intensity ratings at both a group and an individual level. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings identify the neural substrates supporting behavioural effects of false physiological feedback, and highlight mechanisms that underlie subjective anxiety states, including the importance of the right anterior insula in guiding second-order ""cognitive"" representations of bodily arousal state.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17579718,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

As in other idiopathic environmental intolerances, the mechanisms behind the reported hypersensitivity are unknown. Using the advantage of the well-defined trigger (odor), we investigated whether subjects with MCS could have an increased odor-signal response in the odor-processing neuronal circuits. Positron emission tomography (PET) activation studies with several different odorants were carried out in 12 MCS females and 12 female controls. Activation was defined as a significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during smelling of the respective odorant compared to smelling of odorless air. The study also included online measurements of respiratory frequency and amplitude and heart rate variations by recording of R wave intervals (RR) on the surface electrocardiogram. The MCS subjects activated odor-processing brain regions less than controls, despite the reported, and physiologically indicated (decreased RR interval) distress. In parallel, they showed an odorant-related increase in activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and cuneus-precuneus. Notably, the baseline rCBF was normal. Thus, the abnormal patterns were observed only in response to odor signals. Subjects with MCS process odors differently from controls, however, without signs of neuronal sensitization. One possible explanation for the observed pattern of activation in MCS is a top-down regulation of odor-response via cingulate cortex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16767766,N,no corr,,,

RESULTS: Regions with a significant negative correlation between the extent of visual stimuli and BOLD and perfusion responses were found bilaterally on the lateral surface of the occipital lobe just anterior to the occipital pole. These regions were located in the border zone between the territories of the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. CONCLUSION: Insufficient perfusion pressure in these regions may have led to attenuation of BOLD and perfusion responses to stimulation of a large portion of the visual field, or a condition in which a large extent of the visual areas was activated in the proximal regions of the territories perfused by the middle and posterior cerebral arteries.

To test this, we used pressure support ventilation to quantify the difference in end-tidal partial pressure of CO(2) (Pet(CO(2))) between eupnea and the apneic threshold (""CO(2) reserve"") as an index of the propensity for apnea and unstable breathing during sleep, both before and following up to 3-wk exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia in dogs. CIH consisted of 25 s of Pet(O(2)) = 35-40 Torr followed by 35 s of normoxia, and this pattern was repeated 60 times/h, 7-8 h/day for 3 wk. The CO(2) reserve was determined during non-rapid eye movement sleep in normoxia 14-16 h after the most recent hypoxic exposure. Contrary to our hypothesis, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO(2) below eupnea progressively decreased during CIH (control, 1.36 +/- 0.18; week 2, 0.94 +/- 0.12; week 3, 0.73 +/- 0.05 l.min(-1).Torr(-1), P < 0.05).

Its active ingredient, imatinib ([4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidinyl] amino]phenyl]benzamide), blocks the activity of several tyrosine kinases. Here we labeled imatinib with carbon-11 as a tool for determining the drug distribution and pharmacokinetics of imatinib, and we carried out positron emission tomography (PET) studies in baboons. METHODS: [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib was synthesized from [(11)C]methyl iodide and norimatinib was synthesized by the demethylation of imatinib (isolated from Gleevec tablets) according to a patent procedure [Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Anderson LW. Imaging of drug accumulation as a guide to antitumor therapy. US Patent 20030198594A1, 2003]. Norimatinib was also synthesized from the corresponding amine and acid. PET studies were carried out in three baboons to measure pharmacokinetics in the brain and peripheral organs and to determine the effect of a therapeutic dose of imatinib. Log D and plasma protein binding were also measured. RESULTS: [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib uptake in the brain is negligible (consistent with P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux); it peaks and clears rapidly from the heart, lungs and spleen. Peak uptake and clearance occur more slowly in the liver and kidneys, followed by accumulation in the gallbladder and urinary bladder. Pretreatment with imatinib did not change uptake in the heart, lungs, kidneys and spleen, and increased uptake in the liver and gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib has potential for assessing the regional distribution and kinetics of imatinib in the human body to determine whether the drug targets tumors and to identify other organs to which the drug or its labeled metabolites distribute. Paired with tracers such as 2'deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)FDG) and 3'deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ((18)FLT), [N-(11)C-methyl]imatinib may be a useful radiotracer for planning chemotherapy, for monitoring response to treatment and for assessing the role of drug pharmacokinetics in drug resistance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17307123,N,no brain data,,,

In particular, simulating other people's facial affective expressions through imagery in social situations enables us to enact vivid affective responses, which may be inducible from other people's affective responses that are predicted as results of our mental imagery of future behaviors. Therefore, this ability is an important cognitive feature of diverse advanced social cognition in humans. We used functional magnetic imaging to examine brain activation during the imagery of emotional facial expressions as compared to neutral facial expressions. Twenty-one right-handed subjects participated in this study. We observed the activation of the amygdala during the imagining of emotional facial affect versus the imagining of neutral facial affects. In addition, we also observed the activation of several areas of the brain, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventral premotor cortex, superior temporal sulcus, parahippocampal gyrus, lingual gyrus, and the midbrain. Our results suggest that the areas of the brain known to be involved in the actual perception of affective facial expressions are also implicated in the imagery of affective facial expressions. In particular, given that the processing of information concerning the facial patterning of different emotions and the enactment of behavioral responses, such as autonomic arousal, are central components of the imagery of emotional facial expressions, we postulate the central role of the amygdala in the imagery of emotional facial expressions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17359942,N,no phys of interest,,,

The mechanism of this sex-dependent difference is unknown, although reduced baroreflex sensitivity may be involved. Recently, we identified a cortical network associated with autonomic cardiovascular responses to baroreceptor unloading in men.

Forebrain activity in healthy men and women (n = 8 each) was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. Stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were collected on a separate day. Men had larger decreases in SV than women (P < 0.01) during 35 mmHg LBNP only. At 35 mmHg LBNP, HR increased more in males then females (9 +/- 1 beats/min vs. 4 +/- 1 beats/min, P < 0.05).

BOLD signal changes (P < 0.005, uncorrected) were identified within discrete forebrain regions associated with these sex-specific HR and MSNA responses. Men had larger increases in BOLD signal within the right insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex than women. Furthermore, men demonstrated greater BOLD signal reductions in the right amygdala, left insula, ventral anterior cingulate, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex vs. women.

The posterior frontomedian cortex (pFMC) is involved in performance monitoring and signalling the need for adjustments, which can be observed as post-error speed-accuracy shifts at the behavioural level. Furthermore autonomic reactions to an error have been reported. The role of conscious error awareness for this processing cascade has received little attention of researchers so far. We examined the neural correlates of conscious error perception in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. An antisaccade task known to yield sufficient numbers of aware and unaware errors was used. Results from a metaanalysis were used to guide a region of interest (ROI) analysis of the fMRI data. Consistent with previous reports, error-related activity in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ), the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and the insular cortex bilaterally was found. Whereas the RCZ activity did not differentiate between aware and unaware errors, activity in the left anterior inferior insular cortex was stronger for aware as compared to unaware errors. This could be due to increased awareness of the autonomic reaction to an error, or the increased autonomic reaction itself. Furthermore, post-error adjustments were only observed after aware errors and a correlation between post-error slowing and the hemodynamic activity in the RCZ was revealed. The data suggest that the RCZ activity alone is insufficient to drive error awareness. Its signal appears to be useful for post-error speed-accuracy adjustments only when the error is consciously perceived.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185003,N,no corr,,,

However, since this invasive technique implies surgery, with its side-effects and relatively high financial costs, a non-invasive method to stimulate vagal afferences would be a great step forward. We studied effects of non-invasive electrical stimulation of the nerves in the left outer auditory canal in healthy subjects (n = 22), aiming to activate vagal afferences transcutaneously (t-VNS). Short-term changes in brain activation and subjective well-being induced by t-VNS were investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychometric assessment using the Adjective Mood Scale (AMS), a self-rating scale for current subjective feeling. Stimulation of the ear lobe served as a sham control. fMRI showed that robust t-VNS induced BOLD-signal decreases in limbic brain areas, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and the middle and superior temporal gyrus. Increased activation was seen in the insula, precentral gyrus and the thalamus. Psychometric assessment revealed significant improvement of well-being after t-VNS. Ear lobe stimulation as a sham control intervention did not show similar effects in either fMRI or psychometric assessment. No significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or peripheral microcirculation could be detected during the stimulation procedure.

PURPOSE: To determine whether changes in IC neural activity were caused by prior exercise or by changes in BP, this investigation compared patterns of rCBF during periods of hypotension, which was induced by prior exercise (i.e., PEH) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) infusion and a cold pressor (CP), to restore BP. METHODS: Ten subjects were studied on three different days with randomly assigned conditions: i) resting baseline; ii) PEH; and iii) SNP-induced hypotension (matched to the PEH BP decrease). Data were collected for heart rate (HR) and mean BP, and rCBF was assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as an index of brain activation. RESULTS: Using ANOVA across conditions, there were differences (P<0.05; mean +/- SD) from baseline during PEH for HR (+12 +/- 3 bpm) and mean BP (-8 +/- 2 mm Hg) and during SNP-induced hypotension (HR = +15 +/- 4 bpm; MBP = -9 +/- 2 mm Hg), with no differences between PEH and SNP. After exercise, there were decreases (P<0.05) in the leg sensorimotor area, anterior cingulate, and the right and left inferior thalamus, right inferior insula, and left anterior insular regions. During SNP-induced hypotension, there were significant increases in the right and left inferior thalamus and the right and left inferior anterior IC. CP during PEH increased BP and IC activity. CONCLUSIONS: Data show that reductions in IC neural activity are not caused by acute BP decreases. Findings suggest that exercise can lead to a temporary decrease in IC neural activity, which may be a significant neural factor contributing to PEH.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414805,N,no corr,,,

This study explored neural systems underlying sensitivity to symptom-unrelated disgust and fear in OCD using functional neuroimaging. METHODS: Seventeen OCD subjects and 19 controls viewed facial expressions of disgust and fear (versus neutral) presented just above the level of conscious awareness in a backward masking paradigm. RESULTS: The OCD group showed greater activation than controls in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, but reduced activation in the thalamus, to facial expressions of disgust. There were no between-group differences in response to fear. Further analysis using a median-split to divide OCD subjects into high and low washers suggested that the enhanced ventrolateral prefrontal cortex response was being driven by predominantly female OCD subjects with high washing symptoms. These subjects also reported higher levels of trait sensitivity to disgust. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previous reports of increased response to symptom-relevant and generally disgusting stimuli in neural regions associated with disgust and autonomic response processing in OCD patients with prominent washing symptoms.

We used a competitive reaction time task to investigate brain regions involved in social interaction and reactive aggression in sixteen healthy male subjects with fMRI. Subjects were provoked by increasingly aversive stimuli and were given the opportunity to respond aggressively against their opponent by administering a stimulus as retaliation. fMRI revealed an increase of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity during retaliation. The dorsal mPFC was active when subjects had to select the intensity of the retaliation stimulus, and its activity correlated with the selected stimulus strength. In contrast, ventral mPFC was active during observing the opponent suffering but also during retaliation independent of the stimulus strength. Ventral mPFC activation, stronger in low callous subjects, correlated positively with skin conductance response during observation of the suffering opponent. In conclusion, dorsal mPFC activation seems to represent cognitive operations related to more intense social interaction processes whereas the ventral mPFC might be involved in affective processes associated with compassion to the suffering opponent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17071110,N,no coords,,,

In previous studies, a racemic mixture of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil and (S)-[(11)C]verapamil has been used as tracer for assessing P-gp function using positron emission tomography (PET). Quantification, however, is compromised by potential differences in kinetics between these two isomers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetics of pure (R)-[(11)C]verapamil in humans and to develop a tracer kinetic model for the analysis of P-gp-mediated transport of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil, including the putative contribution of its radioactive metabolites. Dynamic (R)-[(11)C]verapamil PET scans of 10 male volunteers were analysed with various single- or two-tissue compartment models, with separate compartments for N-dealkylated and N-demethylated metabolites, assuming that either (R)-[(11)C]verapamil alone or (R)-[(11)C]verapamil and any combination of metabolites cross the BBB. In addition, six of the subjects underwent two (R)-[(11)C]verapamil scans to evaluate test-retest reliability. One hour after injection, 50% of total plasma radioactivity consisted of labelled metabolites. Most models fitted the data well and the analysis did not point to a definite 'best' model, with differences in optimal model between subjects. The lowest mean test-retest variability (2.9%) was found for a single-tissue model without any metabolite correction. Models with separate metabolite compartments lead to high test-retest variability. Assuming that differences in kinetics of (R)-[(11)C]verapamil and N-dealkylated metabolites are small, a one input, one-tissue model with correction for N-demethylated metabolites only leads to a good compromise between fit quality and test-retest variability.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757979,N,no phys of interest,,,

The goals of this study were: (1) to measure reliable EDA from healthy individuals during fMRI involving an effortful unilateral motor task, (2) to explore how EDA recordings can be used to augment fMRI data analysis. In addition to conventional hemodynamic modeling, skin conductance time series data were used as model waveforms to generate activation images from fMRI data. Activations from the EDA model produced significantly different brain regions from those obtained with a standard hemodynamic model, primarily in the insula and cingulate cortices. Onsets of the EDA changes were synchronous with the hemodynamic model, but EDA data showed additional transient features, such as a decrease in amplitude with time, and helped to provide behavioral evidence suggesting task difficulty decreased with movement repetition. Univariate statistics also confirmed that several brain regions showed early versus late session effects. Partial least squares (PLS) multivariate analysis of EDA and fMRI data provided complimentary, additional insight on how the motor network varied over the course of a single fMRI session. Brain regions identified in this manner included the insula, cingulate gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyri, putamen and parietal cortices. These results suggest that recording EDA during motor fMRI experiments provides complementary information that can be used to improve the fMRI analysis, particularly when behavioral or task effects are difficult to model a priori.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17318835,M,pls?,,,

Epub 2007 Nov 15.","UNLABELLED: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an index of coronary stenosis severity. FFR is the ratio of hyperemic myocardial flow in the stenotic area to maximal flow in that same territory without stenosis and can be measured with a pressure wire. In patients with prior infarction, measuring FFR in infarct-related arteries may be different for 2 reasons: a smaller mass of viable myocardium depending on the stenotic infarct-related artery and greater microvascular resistance in the infarcted area than in the reference area. When microvascular resistance does not differ between the infarcted and the reference areas, FFR should equal relative flow reserve (RFR). RFR is the ratio of myocardial blood flow in the stenotic area to blood flow in a normally perfused reference area, at maximal hyperemia. H(2)(15)O PET measures myocardial flow within only the viable areas of an infarct and can be used to measure RFR. The present study assessed in patients with chronic myocardial infarction whether microvascular resistance in the infarct is different from that in the reference area. Therefore, the correlation between FFR and RFR using H(2)(15)O PET was studied. METHODS: In the catheterization laboratory, FFR was measured in the infarct-related artery and a reference coronary artery. The H(2)(15)O PET study and FFR measurements were performed on the same day in 22 patients. RESULTS: In 27 patients, the mean interval between the PET study and infarction was 3.3 y. Most patients had an anterior infarction, and the mean ejection fraction was 44%. The mean FFR and RFR values were 0.75 +/- 0.16 and 0.74 +/- 0.18, respectively. A significant correlation (r = 0.81; P < 0.0001) was found between FFR and RFR. The linear regression line was close to the line of identity. CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic myocardial infarction and a reduced ejection fraction, a good correlation was found between FFR measurements in the infarct-related artery and RFR. Because the linear regression line between FFR and RFR was close to the line of identity, one can conclude that microvascular resistance in the viable myocardium does not differ from that in the reference area.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006610,N,no phys of interest,,,

Psychophysical testing was performed in eleven healthy males who had participated in a positron emission tomography study with [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 ligand for the assessment of 5-HT(1A) receptor binding potential (BP). Psychophysical testing consisted of determining CPP threshold, tolerance, intensity, unpleasantness and CPP threshold modulation by conditioning CPP. Autonomic control was assessed by determining the cutaneous vasoconstriction responses in the finger induced by CPP and Valsalva maneuver. CPP intensity was inversely correlated with 5-HT(1A) BP in multiple cortical and subcortical areas, including the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, insula, amygdala and the dorsal raphe. CPP unpleasantness was not significantly correlated with 5-HT(1A) BP in any of the regions of interest. Increase of CPP threshold by conditioning CPP was directly correlated with 5-HT(1A) BP in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. Vasoconstriction induced by Valsalva but not CPP was directly correlated with 5-HT(1A) BP in the ventral part of the anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula. The results suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptors in the brain influence pain and Valsalva-induced sympathetic vasoconstriction reflex. In general, subjects with high availability of 5-HT(1A) receptors have low CPP intensity accompanied by a high capacity for central suppression of pain or a sympathetic vasoconstriction response by a Valsalva maneuver.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17803974,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2007 Jun 1.","Modeling short-term psychotic states with subanaesthetic doses of ketamine provides substantial experimental evidence in support of the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Ketamine exerts its pharmacological effects both directly via interactions with glutamate receptors and indirectly by stimulating presynaptic release of endogenous serotonin (5-HT). The aim of this feasibility study was to examine whether acute ketamine-induced 5-HT release interferes with the binding of the 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R) radioligand [(18)F]altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET). Two subjects treated with ketamine and one subject treated with placebo underwent [(18)F]altanserin PET at distribution equilibrium conditions. Robust physiological, psychopathological and cognitive effects were present at ketamine plasma concentrations exceeding 100 microg/l during >70 min. Notwithstanding, we observed stable radioligand binding (changes +/-95% CI of -1.0 +/- 1.6% and +4.1 +/- 1.8% versus -1.2 +/- 2.6%) in large cortical regions presenting high basal uptake of both, [(18)F]altanserin and ketamine. Marginal decreases of 4% of radioligand binding were observed in the frontal lobe, and 8% in a posteriorily specified frontomesial subregion. This finding is not compatible with a specific radioligand displacement from 5-HT(2A)R which should occur proportionally throughout the whole brain. Instead, the spatial pattern of these minor reductions was congruent with ketamine-induced increases in cerebral blood flow observed in a previous study using [(15)O]butanol PET. This may caused by accelerated clearance of unspecifically bound [(18)F]altanserin from cerebral tissue with increased perfusion. In conclusion, this study suggests that [(18)F]altanserin PET is not sensitive to acute neurotransmitter fluctuations under ketamine. Advantageously, the stability of [(18)F]altanserin PET towards acute influences is a prerequisite for its future use to detect sub-acute and chronic effects of ketamine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17541696,N,no phys of interest,,,

We hypothesized that dopamine would modulate the PE related signal in aversive conditioning and that haloperidol would reduce PE related activity, while an acute dose of amphetamine would increase PE related activity in the ventral striatum. METHODS: Healthy participants took an acute dose of amphetamine, haloperidol, or placebo. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the BOLD signal while they carried out an aversive conditioning task, using cutaneous electrical stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus (US) and yellow and blue circles as conditioned stimulus (CS+ and CS-, respectively). RESULTS: Prediction error related BOLD activity was seen only in the ventral striatum in the placebo subjects. The subjects given amphetamine showed a wider network of PE related BOLD activity, including the ventral striatum, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate, and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area. Haloperidol subjects did not show PE related activity in any of these regions.

Human studies suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a role similar to PL in mediating or modulating fear responses.

METHODS: Novel analyses were conducted on data from two cohorts that had previously undergone scanning to study fear extinction. Structural and functional brain data were acquired with MRI; the functional MRI (fMRI) component employed an event-related design. Skin conductance response (SCR) was the index of conditioned responses. RESULTS: We found that: 1) cortical thickness within dACC is positively correlated with SCR during conditioning; 2) dACC is activated by a conditioned fear stimulus; and 3) this activation is positively correlated with differential SCR. Moreover, the dACC region implicated in this research corresponds to the target of anterior cingulotomy, an ablative surgical treatment for patients with mood and anxiety disorders.

No significant relationship was observed between BPs and morphometric measures.

Opioid binding varies in different brain regions. It is unclear whether opioids alter neurovascular coupling, or whether their effects are purely neuronal. This study used BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to investigate the effect of a mu-opioid agonist remifentanil, on cerebrovascular CO(2) reactivity (being one component of neurovascular coupling). Hypercapnic challenges were delivered to human volunteers, while controlling potential opioid-induced respiratory depression. The BOLD signal increase to hypercapnia was compared before and during remifentanil administration. Remifentanil was shown not to have a generalised effect on CO(2) responsiveness in the cerebral vasculature. However, it caused a significant reduction in the positive BOLD response to hypercapnia in the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices, bilateral extrastriate visual areas, left insula, left caudate nucleus, and left inferior temporal gyrus. We conclude that remifentanil does not modulate cerebrovascular CO(2) reactivity, as we saw no difference in BOLD response to hypercapnia in areas with high opioid receptor densities. We did however see a focal reduction in areas related to motor control and putative task activation, which we conclude to be related to changes in neuronal activity related to the sedative effects of remifentanil.

We imaged motivational processes, implemented in a paradigm that varied the amount and reportability of monetary rewards for which subjects exerted physical effort. We show that, even when subjects cannot report how much money is at stake, they nevertheless deploy more force for higher amounts. Such a motivational effect is underpinned by engagement of a specific basal forebrain region.

Structures connecting bodily signals and interoceptive awareness could trigger, in a feedforward manner, behavioral responses appropriate to maintain a desired state of the cardiovascular system. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at identifying brain structures that are mutually activated during interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and during cardiovascular arousal. Additionally, we searched for brain regions connecting interoception with feelings. During the interoceptive task (directing attention towards heartbeats in relation to an exteroceptive task) the thalamus, the insula, the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate and the inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the somatomotor cortex were activated. The conjunction of the interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and cardiovascular arousal revealed structures presumably connecting both conditions, i.e. the right thalamus, insula, somatomotor cortex, and the dorsal cingulate as well as medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the degree of interoceptive awareness predicted the degree of activation of both the insula and the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate gyrus. Negative feelings correlated with the BOLD response of the interoceptive awareness condition in the dorsal cingulate gyrus extending into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We provide evidence that the insula, the dorsal cingulate gyrus, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are specifically involved in processing cardiac sensations. The dorsal cingulate gyrus and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex presumably represent the neural substrates of experiencing negative emotions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17296169,N,no corr,,,

Here we explored how frontal networks respond in a gambling paradigm in which uncertainty was manipulated to increase demands for cognitive control. In one experiment, pupil diameter covaried with uncertainty during decision making and with the degree to which subsequent outcomes violated reward expectations. In a second experiment, fMRI showed that both uncertainty and unexpected outcomes modulated activation in a network of frontal regions. Thus, the frontal network supports multiple phases of the decision-making process including information regarding reward uncertainty and reward outcome. In contrast, striatal activation only tracked reward delivery, suggesting a distinct reward pathway that might, under certain circumstances, oppose the frontal network. These results are consistent with the interpretation that reward signals may bias recruitment of frontal networks that are linked to allocation of cognitive resources.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17632014,N,no phys of interest,,,

To investigate this hypothesis, temporal correlations between cardiac rate and resting-state fMRI signal timecourses were assessed at 3 T. Resting-state BOLD fMRI and accompanying physiological data were acquired and analyzed using cross-correlation and regression. Time-shifted cardiac rate timecourses were included as regressors in addition to established physiological regressors (RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000.

Significant correlations between the cardiac rate and BOLD signal timecourses were revealed, particularly negative correlations in gray matter at time shifts of 6-12 s and positive correlations at time shifts of 30-42 s (TR=6 s). Regressors consisting of cardiac rate timecourses shifted by delays of between 0 and 24 s explained an additional 1% of the BOLD signal variance on average over the whole brain across 9 subjects, a similar additional variance to that explained by respiration volume per unit time and RETROICOR regressors, even when used in combination with these other physiological regressors.

Nonsmoking participants were given either placebo or nicotine (NICORETTE gum, 2 mg) and performed a target-detection task with warned and unwarned trials in the visual and auditory modality. Our results provide evidence for modality-specific correlates of visual and auditory alertness in respective higher-level sensory cortices and in posterior parietal and frontal brain areas. The only region commonly involved in visual and auditory alertness was the right superior temporal gyrus. A connectivity analysis showed that this supramodal region exhibited modality-dependent coupling with respective higher sensory cortices. Nicotine was found to mainly decrease visual and auditory alertness-related activity in several brain regions, which was evident as a significant interaction of nicotine-induced decreases in BOLD signal in warned trials and increases in unwarned trials. The cholinergic drug also affected alerting-dependent activity in the supramodal right superior temporal gyrus; here the effect was the result of a significant increase of neural activity in unwarned trials. We conclude that the role of the right superior temporal gyrus is to induce an ""alert"" state in response to warning cues and thereby optimize stimulus processing and responding.

Dependent measures included heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, skin temperature, and self-reported craving (0-100) following each video. Overall findings indicated that smokers had greater reactivity to the smoking videos than to neutral videos (p<.01). Follow-up univariate analyses revealed significant cue effects on self-reported craving, galvanic skin response, and skin temperature. Interestingly, exploratory examination of gender revealed that men had higher blood pressure and skin temperature responses than women, and that women had higher responses when viewing videos of women smoking than when viewing men smoking.

RESULTS: Statistical parametric brain mapping revealed the importance of right (nondominant) parietal cortex to directing attention internally to one's visceral state and focusing on a specific body signal.

However, EEG acquired in a magnetic field is contaminated by ballistocardiogram (BKG) artifact. The most commonly used method of BKG artifact reduction, averaged artifact subtraction (AAS), was not designed to account for overlapping BKG waveforms generated by adjacent beats. We describe a new method based on a moving general linear model (mGLM) that accounts for overlapping BKG waveforms. METHODS: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 3 Tesla was performed in nine normal human subjects (8-11 runs/subject, 5.52 min/run). Gradient switching artifact was effectively reduced using commercially supplied procedures. Cardiac beats were detected using a novel correlation detector algorithm applied to the EKG trace. BKG artifact was reduced using both mGLM and AAS. RESULTS: mGLM recovered BKG waveforms outlasting the median inter-beat interval. mGLM more effectively than AAS removed variance in the EEG attributable to BKG artifact. CONCLUSIONS: mGLM offers advantages over AAS especially in the presence of variable heart rate. SIGNIFICANCE: The BKG artifact reduction procedure described herein improves the technique of simultaneous EEG-fMRI.

This study used O-water and positron emission tomography to investigate dose-dependent effects of the short-acting mu-selective opioid agonist remifentanil on regional cerebral blood flow during experimentally induced painful heat stimulation in healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Positron emission tomography measurements were performed with injection of 7 mCi O-water during nonpainful heat and painful heat stimulation of the volar forearm. Three experimental conditions were used during both sensory stimuli: saline, 0.05 microg x kg x min remifentanil, and 0.15 microg x kg x min remifentanil. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were monitored noninvasively. Across the three conditions, dose-dependent effects of remifentanil on regional cerebral blood flow were analyzed on a pixel-wise basis using a statistical parametric mapping approach. RESULTS: During saline infusion, regional cerebral blood flow increased in response to noxious thermal stimulation in a number of brain regions as previously reported. There was a reduction in pain-related activations with increasing doses of remifentanil in the thalamus, insula, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Increasing activation occurred in the cingulofrontal cortex (including the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex) and the periaqueductal gray. CONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil induced regional cerebral blood flow increases in the cingulofrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray during pain stimulation, indicating that mu-opioidergic activation modulates activity in pain inhibitory circuitries.

Stress in men was associated with CBF increase in the right prefrontal cortex (RPFC) and CBF reduction in the left orbitofrontal cortex (LOrF), a robust response that persisted beyond the stress task period. In contrast, stress in women primarily activated the limbic system, including the ventral striatum, putamen, insula and cingulate cortex. The asymmetric prefrontal activity in males was associated with a physiological index of stress responses-salivary cortisol, whereas the female limbic activation showed a lower degree of correlations with cortisol. Conjunction analyses indicated only a small degree of overlap between the stress networks in men and women at the threshold level of P < 0.01. Increased overlap of stress networks between the two genders was revealed when the threshold for conjunction analyses was relaxed to P < 0.05.

RESULTS: FTLD patients were comparable to controls in 1) emotional reactivity to the fear, happy, and sad film clips and 2) emotion recognition for the happy film clip. However, FTLD patients were significantly impaired compared with controls in emotion recognition for the fear and sad film clips. Volumetric analyses revealed that deficits in emotion recognition were associated with decreased lobar volumes in the frontal and temporal lobes.

During scanning, 27 schizophrenia (13 paranoid, 14 nonparanoid) and 22 matched healthy control subjects viewed standardized facial expressions of fear, anger and disgust (versus neutral). Skin conductance responses [SCRs]were acquired simultaneously to assess phasic increases in arousal. 'With-arousal' versus 'without-arousal' responses were analysed using non-parametric methods.

Schizophrenia patients displayed abnormally increased phasic arousal, with concomitant reductions in emotion-specific regions and MPFC. These findings may reflect a general disconnection between central and autonomic systems for processing signals of danger. This disjunction was most apparent in patients with a profile of paranoia, coupled with poor social function and insight.

We investigated this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging and virtual reality contexts. Subjects underwent differential context conditioning in which they were repeatedly exposed to two contexts (CXT+ and CXT-) in semirandom order, with contexts counterbalanced across participants. An unsignaled footshock was consistently paired with the CXT+, and no shock was ever delivered in the CXT-. Evidence for context conditioning was established using skin conductance and anxiety ratings. Consistent with animal models centrally implicating the hippocampus and amygdala in a network supporting context conditioning, CXT+ compared with CXT- significantly activated right anterior hippocampus and bilateral amygdala. In addition, context conditioning was associated with activation in posterior orbitofrontal cortex, medial dorsal thalamus, anterior insula, subgenual anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal, inferior frontal, and parietal cortices. Structural equation modeling was used to assess interactions among the core brain regions mediating context conditioning. The derived model indicated that medial amygdala was the source of key efferent and afferent connections including input from orbitofrontal cortex.

In order to test this hypothesis, we presented rising, falling, and constant intensity sounds to healthy humans and gathered psychophysiological and behavioral responses. Brain activity was measured using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that rising compared with falling sound intensity facilitates autonomic orienting reflex and phasic alertness to auditory targets. Rising intensity sounds produced neural activity in the amygdala, which was accompanied by activity in intraparietal sulcus, superior temporal sulcus, and temporal plane.

Models connecting changes in vascular tone and oxygen consumption to observed changes in the blood parameters are needed to guide more quantitative physiological interpretation of these functional neuroimaging modalities. Effective lumped-parameter vascular balloon and Windkessel models have been developed for this purpose, but the lumping of the complex vascular network into a series of arterioles, capillaries, and venules allows only qualitative interpretation.

The model, derived from measured physical properties, predicts baseline blood pressure and oxygen saturation distributions and dynamic responses consistent with literature. Furthermore, the VAN model allows investigation of spatial features of the dynamic vascular and oxygen response to neuronal activity.

Analogously, he may experience rejoice when his choice resulted in better outcomes. We used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of regret and rejoice where payoffs are in terms of a non-monetary medium. Incentives were created using painful outcomes in the form of mild electrical shocks to the foot and the possibility of avoiding them. We hypothesized that the neural response to a painful outcome resulting from an individual's choice would also reflect the degree of regret as measured by the likelihood that alternative choices would have yielded the same adverse outcome. Similarly, when an individual avoids a potential shock, he would experience a degree of rejoice that correlates with the probability he had of receiving the shock. For example, winning a bet when winning was unlikely, even if the outcome is the same, evokes more rejoice than winning when it was highly probable.

The objective was to determine whether brain alterations in OSA bear relationships to depressive symptoms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University-based medical center. PARTICIPANTS: 40 treatment-naive OSA subjects and 61 control subjects without diagnosed psychopathology. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Whole-brain maps of T2 relaxation time, a measure sensitive to injury, were calculated from magnetic resonance images, transformed to common space, and smoothed. Control and OSA groups were classified by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II scores (> or =12 symptomatic, <10 asymptomatic for depressive symptoms). The OSA group separated into 13 symptomatic (mean +/- SD: BDI-II 21 +/- 8; age 47.6 +/- 11; apnea hypopnea index [AHI] 28.3 +/- 17), and 27 asymptomatic (4 +/- 3; 47.5 +/- 8; 31.5 +/- 16) subjects.

Relative to asymptomatic controls, symptomatic OSA patients showed damage in the bilateral hippocampus and caudate nuclei, anterior corpus callosum, right anterior thalamus, and medial pons.

In particular, the possibility is discussed that the ""default network"", being a brain area that deactivates during non-specific general tasks, is a hemodynamic effect caused by heart rate variations. Of fifteen healthy controls ECG, EEG and fMRI were co-registered. Slice time dependent heart rate regressors were derived from the ECG data and correlated to fMRI using a linear correlation analysis where the impulse response is estimated from the data. It was found that in most subjects substantial correlations between heart rate variations and fMRI exist, both within the brain and at the ventricles. The brain areas with high correlation to heart rate are different from the ""default network"" and the response functions deviate from the canonical hemodynamic response function. Furthermore, a general negative correlation was found between heart beat intervals (reverse of heart rate) and alpha power. We interpret this finding by assuming that subject's state varies between drowsiness and wakefulness. Finally, given this large correlation, we re-examined the contribution of heart rate variations to earlier reported fMRI/alpha band correlations, by adding heart rate regressors as confounders. It was found that inclusion of these confounders most often had a negligible effect. From its strong correlation to alpha power, we conclude that the heart rate variations contain important physiological information about subject's resting state. However, it does not provide a full explanation of the behaviour of the ""default network"". Its application as confounder in fMRI experiments is a relatively small computational effort, but may have a substantial impact in paradigms where heart rate is controlled by the stimulus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18539049,N,methods paper,,,

We analyzed resting fMRI data taken before and after verum and sham acupuncture. Electrocardiography data were used to infer autonomic modulation through measures of heart rate variability (HRV). Probabilistic independent component analysis was used to separate resting fMRI data into DMN and SMN components. Following verum, but not sham, acupuncture there was increased DMN connectivity with pain (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), periaqueductal gray), affective (amygdala, ACC), and memory (hippocampal formation, middle temporal gyrus) related brain regions. Furthermore, increased DMN connectivity with the hippocampal formation, a region known to support memory and interconnected with autonomic brain regions, was negatively correlated with acupuncture-induced increase in a sympathetic related HRV metric (LFu), and positively correlated with a parasympathetic related metric (HFu). Following verum, but not sham, acupuncture there was also increased SMN connectivity with pain-related brain regions (ACC, cerebellum). We attribute differences between verum and sham acupuncture to more varied and stronger sensations evoked by verum acupuncture.

To address a disadvantage of this state-of-the-art VNS device, the use of an alternative transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation technique, designed for muscular stimulation, was studied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to test non-invasively access nerve structures associated with the vagus nerve system. The results and their impact are unsatisfying due to missing brainstem activations. These activations, however, are mandatory for reasoning, higher subcortical and cortical activations of vagus nerve structures. The objective of this study was to test a new parameter setting and a novel device for performing specific (well-controlled) transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) at the inner side of the tragus. This paper shows the feasibility of these and their potential for brainstem and cerebral activations as measured by blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, four healthy male adults were scanned inside a 1.5-Tesla MR scanner while undergoing tVNS at the left tragus. We ensured that our newly developed tVNS stimulator was adapted to be an MR-safe stimulation device. In the experiment, cortical and brainstem representations during tVNS were compared to a baseline. RESULTS: A positive BOLD response was detected during stimulation in brain areas associated with higher order relay nuclei of vagal afferent pathways, respectively the left locus coeruleus, the thalamus (left >> right), the left prefrontal cortex, the right and the left postcentral gyrus, the left posterior cingulated gyrus and the left insula. Deactivations were found in the right nucleus accumbens and the right cerebellar hemisphere. CONCLUSION: The method and device are feasible and appropriate for accessing cerebral vagus nerve structures, respectively.

It has been suggested that an opioidergic signal, which is engaged through conditioning and acts inhibitory on unconditioned stimulus input, is the source of these effects. To clarify whether blockade of endogenous opioid neurotransmission enhances acquisition of conditioned fear in humans, and to elucidate the neural underpinnings of such an effect, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with behavioral recordings and a double-blind pharmacological intervention. All subjects underwent the same classical fear-conditioning paradigm, but subjects in the experimental group received the opioid antagonist naloxone before and during the experiment, in contrast to subjects in the control group, who received saline. Blocking endogenous opioid neurotransmission with naloxone led to more sustained responses to the unconditioned stimulus across trials, evident in both behavioral and blood oxygen level-dependent responses in pain responsive cortical regions. This effect was likely caused by naloxone blocking conditioned responses in a pain-inhibitory circuit involving opioid-rich areas such as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Most importantly, naloxone enhanced the acquisition of fear on the behavioral level and changed the activation profile of the amygdala: whereas the control group showed rapidly decaying conditioned responses across trials, the naloxone group showed sustained conditioned responses in the amygdala. Together, these results demonstrate that in humans the endogenous opioid system has an inhibitory role in the acquisition of fear.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18495880,N,pharma study,,,

Measurements were taken in four volunteers asynchronously and carefully aligned for comparative analysis. In order to describe the main stimulus in BHT, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) parameter was integrated into the balloon model as the driving function of cerebral blood flow (CBF) which led to the development of an expanded balloon model (EBM). During BHT, the increase in HbR was observed later than the BOLD peak and coincided temporally with its post-stimulus undershoot. Further investigation of these transients with a PaCO(2) integrated balloon model suggests that post-stimulus undershoot measured by fMRI is dominated by slow return of cerebral blood volume (CBV). This was confirmed by fNIRS measurements. In addition, the BOLD signal decreased with the increase of the initial level of PaCO(2) derived from EBM, indicating an effect of basal CBF level on the BOLD signal.

We found that levodopa did not alter RAC-binding potential at rest but it enhanced training effects on motor memory formation as well as dopamine release in the dorsal caudate nucleus. Motor memory formation during training correlated with the increase of dopamine release in the caudate nucleus. These results demonstrate that levodopa may ameliorate dopamine deficiencies in the elderly by replenishing dopaminergic presynaptic stores, actively engaged in phasic dopamine release during motor training.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17098331,N,no phys of interest,,,

Animal models indicate that the amygdala orchestrates stressor-evoked blood pressure reactions via reciprocal signaling with corticolimbic and brainstem cardiovascular-regulatory circuits. Based on these models, we used a multimodal neuroimaging approach to determine whether human individual differences in stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity vary with amygdala activation, gray matter volume, and functional connectivity with corticolimbic and brainstem areas implicated in stressor processing and cardiovascular regulation. We monitored mean arterial pressure (MAP) and concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging BOLD signal changes in healthy young individuals while they completed a Stroop color-word stressor task, validated previously in epidemiological studies of cardiovascular risk. Individuals exhibiting greater stressor-evoked MAP reactivity showed (1) greater amygdala activation, (2) lower amygdala gray matter volume, and (3) stronger positive functional connectivity between the amygdala and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and brainstem pons. Individual differences in amygdala activation, gray matter volume, and functional connectivity with corticolimbic and brainstem circuits may partly underpin cardiovascular disease risk by impacting stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216206,Y,corr,uns,,

The purpose of this study was to compare the cerebral blood flow (CBF) of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) during stimulation with experimental pain tolerance or sham stimulation, before and after 2 weeks of at least partially effective antidepressant treatment (ADT), in order to determine the cerebral regions associated with pain processing in the two clinical states. METHODS: Twenty-four antidepressant-free outpatients diagnosed with MDD (DSM-IV), without any pain complaints and a basal score>or=20 points on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were included. Cerebral SPECTs were performed before and after ADT. Patients were stimulated with pain pressure tolerance (PT) or sham stimulation during the radiotracer cerebral uptake time. RESULTS: The comparison between PT and sham stimulation before ADT showed an increase of CBF of PT stimulated patients in right temporal gyrus, left amygdale, right anterior cingulated cortex, bilateral medial frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, lingual gyrus, right precentral gyrus and left postcentral gyrus. Equal comparison after ADT showed an increase of CBF of PT stimulated patients only in left middle frontal gyrus. LIMITATIONS: The sample includes exclusively outpatients with mild-moderate depression. CONCLUSION: CBF before ADT increases in brain areas related with the affective and cognitive components of pain; in contrast, after ADT increases only in cognitive pain related areas.

For the first time, we thus compared, through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the pattern of cerebral activations in 13 skilled and 15 unskilled imagers during both physical execution and MI of a sequence of finger movements. Differences in MI abilities were assessed using well-established questionnaire and chronometric measures, as well as a new index based upon the subject's peripheral responses from the autonomic nervous system. As expected, both good and poor imagers activated the inferior and superior parietal lobules, as well as motor-related regions including the lateral and medial premotor cortex, the cerebellum and putamen. Inter-group comparisons revealed that good imagers activated more the parietal and ventrolateral premotor regions, which are known to play a critical role in the generation of mental images. By contrast, poor imagers recruited the cerebellum, orbito-frontal and posterior cingulate cortices. Consistent with findings from the motor sequence learning literature and Doyon and Ungerleider's model of motor learning [Doyon, J., Ungerleider, L.G., 2002. Functional anatomy of motor skill learning. In: Squire, L.R., Schacter, D.L.

Glutamate (Glu) is an excitatory neurotransmitter that functions in pain-processing pathways. This study was carried out to investigate the relationship between changing levels of Glu within the insula and changes in multiple pain domains in patients with FM. METHODS: Ten patients with FM underwent 2 sessions of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) and 2 sessions of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), each conducted before and after a nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce pain. During H-MRS, the anterior and posterior insular regions were examined separately using single-voxel spectroscopy. The levels of Glu and other metabolites were estimated relative to levels of creatine (Cr) (e.g., the Glu/Cr ratio). During FMRI, painful pressures were applied to the thumbnail to elicit neuronal activation. Experimental pressure-evoked pain thresholds and clinical pain ratings (on the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire [SF-MPQ]) were also assessed prior to each imaging session RESULTS: Both experimental pain (P = 0.047 versus pretreatment) and SF-MPQ-rated clinical pain (P = 0.043 versus pretreatment) were reduced following treatment. Changes from pre- to posttreatment in Glu/Cr were negatively correlated with changes in experimental pain thresholds (r = -0.95, P < 0.001) and positively correlated with changes in clinical pain (r = 0.85, P = 0.002). Changes in the FMRI-determined blood oxygenation level-dependent effect (a measure of neural activation) were positively correlated with changes in Glu/Cr within the contralateral insula (r = 0.81, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Changes in Glu levels within the insula are associated with changes in multiple pain domains in patients with FM. Thus, H-MRS data may serve as a useful biomarker and surrogate end point for clinical trials of FM.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18311814,N,no phys of interest,,,

Inter-individual variation of cerebral vascular tone is considered to contribute to this, and several determinants of cerebral vascular tone have been proposed. In the present study, the relationship between CBF and cerebral vascular tone to inter-individual variation at rest condition was investigated using positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: CBF was measured using PET with H(2) (15)O in each of 20 healthy subjects (20-28 years) under three conditions: at rest (baseline), during hypercapnia and during hypocapnia. The vascular response to change in P(a)CO(2) was calculated as the percentage changes in CBF per absolute change in P(a)CO(2) in response to hypercapnia and hypocapnia. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation between baseline CBF and the vascular response to hypocapnia was observed in the thalamus, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex and cerebral cortex (P < 0.05). A trend towards negative correlation between baseline CBF and the vascular response to hypocapnia was observed in the cerebellum and putamen (P < 0.1). A significant negative correlation between baseline CBF and the vascular response to hypercapnia was observed in the occipital cortex (P < 0.05). No significant correlation was observed between baseline CBF and haemoglobin concentration, and P(a)CO(2). CONCLUSION: These findings support the assumption that cerebral vascular tone might incline towards vasoconstriction and vasodilatation when baseline CBF is low and high between individuals respectively. Although several determinants of cerebral vascular tone have been proposed, the mechanism of such inter-individual differences in cerebral vascular tone is unknown.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18298636,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2007 May 2.","It is hypothesized that due to an abnormal functioning of the reward system patients with schizophrenia form context-inappropriate associations. It has been shown that the dopamine target regions, especially the ventral striatum, are critical in the formation of reward associations. We wanted to examine how the ventral striatum responds as patients learn reward-related associations and how this neural response is linked to objective and subjective behavioral measures. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses were examined using aversive Pavlovian learning in 13 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 13 matched healthy controls. Colored circles served as conditioned stimulus (CS+) while a loud, individually adjusted, noise served as the unconditioned stimulus. Circles of another color served as neutral comparators (CS-). Subjective indices were assessed by a post-scan self-report, and galvanic skin responses (GSR) were used as objective measures of associative learning. fMRI data were analyzed using a random effects model in SPM2. Patients showed inappropriately strong activations in the ventral striatum in response to the neutral stimulus (CS-) as compared to the healthy controls. Consistent with this neural evidence of aberrant learning, patients also showed evidence of abnormal learning by self-report and as indexed by GSR. The main finding here is that patients with schizophrenia, when exposed to neutral stimuli in a threatening situation, show an abnormal pattern of learning. The aberrant activations and response are consistent with the idea that patients aberrantly assign motivational salience to neutral stimuli, and this process may be one of the aberrations that predisposes them to psychosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17473838,N,pharma study,,,

Epub 2007 Oct 4.","This study evaluated a calibration technique for scaling the fMRI-BOLD response during a simple motor task. A novel scaling parameter, resting state physiological fluctuation amplitude (RSFA), was tested using previously established scaling factors such as breath hold or 5% CO(2). RSFA was hypothesized to contain vascular reactivity information present in the resting state fMRI signal. Subjects were scanned under various stimulus conditions: (a) rest while breathing room air, (b) bilateral fingertapping, (c) breath holding and (d) moderate hypercapnia (breathing 5% CO(2)+air). In all subjects who breathed 5% CO(2), RSFA correlated highly with the BOLD response amplitude during 5% CO(2) inhalation. Also, RSFA correlated highly with the amplitude of the BOLD response elicited by breath hold. RSFA was therefore used as a hemodynamic scaling factor to calibrate both the amplitude and spatial extent of the fMRI-BOLD response during the motor task (fingertapping). Results revealed that amplitude scaling using RSFA was similar to that using breath hold or 5% CO(2), where the spatial extent of activation diminished by 20-37% over all subjects. Spatial extent of activation changed significantly after scaling and only 30-40% of the activated area overlapped with the unscaled activation. RSFA-scaled task-induced fMRI-BOLD response in both amplitude and spatial extent was comparable to that obtained using breath hold or 5% CO(2). We conclude that RSFA may be used to hemodynamically scale the fMRI-BOLD response and does not require the use of a hypercapnic challenge (which may not be purely non-neural), which can be difficult to implement in special populations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18343159,N,methods paper,,,

[(15)O]H(2)O PET data from a consecutive cohort of 65 idiopathic NPH patients were retrospectively analyzed questioning whether the functional status before and after shunt treatment might correlate with local blood flow. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London), the [(15)O]H(2)O uptake was correlated with the preoperative clinical scores, graded according to a modified Stein and Langfitt score. Furthermore, differences in the uptake in the pre-and post-shunt treatment study after seven to 10 days in patients with and without clinical improvement were studied. RESULTS: A higher clinical score significantly correlated with a reduced tracer uptake in mesial frontal (k=1,239 voxel, Z=4.41) and anterior temporal (k=469, Z=4.07) areas. In the mesial frontal areas, tracer uptake showed significant reciprocal changes in the clinically improved vs. the unimproved patients. CONCLUSION: Matched with the existing literature, the regional blood flow alterations are suggested relevant to the NPH syndrome and to post-treatment functional changes.

Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19104670,N,rsa paper,,,

The goal of the current study was to identify brain networks activated by expected and delivered aversive visceral stimuli in male and female patients with chronic abdominal pain, and to test for sex differences in the effective connectivity of the circuitry comprising these networks. Network analysis was applied to assess the brain response of 46 IBS patients (22 men and 24 women) recorded using [15O] water positron emission tomography during rest/baseline and expected and delivered aversive rectal distension.

Effective connectivity results obtained via structural equation modeling indicated that sex-related differences in brain response are largely due to alterations in the effective connectivity of emotional-arousal circuitry rather than visceral afferent processing circuits.

Through neurosurgical decompression, the blood pressure can be reduced in these cases, and the conventional medication can also become more effective. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analysed the changes in the blood pressure and therapy of patients with or without neurosurgical decompression over a 2-year period. The 2-year data were available for 9 operated and 7 non-operated patients with neurovascular compression. The data of control examinations performed 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the intervention (or after MR-angiography in the non-operated cases) were analysed. RESULTS: After the decompression, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly and permanently in all cases, and there was an improved response to the medication. In the non-operated group, the blood pressure did not change significantly during the 2 years.

In the present study, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how fear conditioning affected the visual processing of task-irrelevant faces. We hypothesized that faces previously paired with shock (threat faces) would more effectively vie for processing resources during conditions involving spatial competition. To investigate this question, following conditioning, participants performed a letter-detection task on an array of letters that was superimposed on task-irrelevant faces. Attentional resources were manipulated by having participants perform an easy or a difficult search task. Our findings revealed that threat fearful faces evoked stronger responses in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus relative to safe fearful faces during low-load attentional conditions, but not during high-load conditions. Consistent with the increased processing of shock-paired stimuli during the low-load condition, such stimuli exhibited increased behavioral priming and fMRI repetition effects relative to unpaired faces during a subsequent implicit-memory task. Overall, our results suggest a competition model in which affective significance signals from the amygdala may constitute a key modulatory factor determining the neural fate of visual stimuli.

However, virtually nothing is known about the impact of the voluntary generation of compassion on this network. To investigate these questions we assessed brain activity using fMRI while novice and expert meditation practitioners generated a loving-kindness-compassion meditation state. To probe affective reactivity, we presented emotional and neutral sounds during the meditation and comparison periods. Our main hypothesis was that the concern for others cultivated during this form of meditation enhances affective processing, in particular in response to sounds of distress, and that this response to emotional sounds is modulated by the degree of meditation training. The presentation of the emotional sounds was associated with increased pupil diameter and activation of limbic regions (insula and cingulate cortices) during meditation (versus rest). During meditation, activation in insula was greater during presentation of negative sounds than positive or neutral sounds in expert than it was in novice meditators. The strength of activation in insula was also associated with self-reported intensity of the meditation for both groups. These results support the role of the limbic circuitry in emotion sharing. The comparison between meditation vs. rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala, right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to all sounds, suggesting, greater detection of the emotional sounds, and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation. Together these data indicate that the mental expertise to cultivate positive emotion alters the activation of circuitries previously linked to empathy and theory of mind in response to emotional stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18365029,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2008 Sep 10.","BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) appears to be useful for investigating motor recovery after stroke. Some of the potential confounders of brain activation studies, however, could be mitigated through complementary physiological monitoring. OBJECTIVE: To investigate a sensorimotor fMRI battery that included simultaneous measurement of electrodermal activity in subjects with hemiparetic stroke to provide a measure related to the sense of effort during motor performance. METHODS: Bilateral hand and ankle tasks were performed by 6 patients with stroke (2 subacute, 4 chronic) during imaging with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI using an event-related design. BOLD percent changes, peak activation, and laterality index values were calculated in the sensorimotor cortex. Electrodermal recordings were made concurrently and used as a regressor. RESULTS: Sensorimotor BOLD time series and percent change values provided evidence of an intact motor network in each of these well-recovered patients. During tasks involving the hemiparetic limb, electrodermal activity changes were variable in amplitude, and electrodermal activity time-series data showed significant correlations with fMRI in 3 of 6 patients. No such correlations were observed for control tasks involving the unaffected lower limb. CONCLUSIONS: Electrodermal activity activation maps implicated the contralesional over the ipsilesional hemisphere, supporting the notion that stroke patients may require higher order motor processing to perform simple tasks. Electrodermal activity recordings may be useful as a physiological marker of differences in effort required during movements of a subject's hemiparetic compared with the unaffected limb during fMRI studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18784267,N,clinical,,,

To extend these findings to human volunteers, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural responses associated with context fear conditioning in humans. Our novel conditioning paradigm consisted of aversive electrical shocks (unconditioned stimulus) that were delivered either cue or context related. Differential evoked responses, related to the conditioned stimulus (CS), were found in the anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral insular cortices, regions that have been implicated in anticipatory anxiety. In case of context conditioning, a similar pattern was observed during the presentation of the entire context. In line with previous conditioning studies, differential responses in the amygdala showed a time by stimulus interaction, suggesting rapid adaptation of CS-specific responses. More importantly, a similar differential decay of activation was observed during context conditioning in the hippocampus, in agreement with a role of the hippocampus in the acquisition phase of human context fear conditioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18768697,N,no corr,,,

The changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were also evaluated using a hypotension condition established by our group based on the administration of a vasodilator. Under normal conditions, CBF, PO2, and OIS showed positive signal changes (48%, 32%, and 0.42%, respectively) following stimulation.

Under the hypotension condition the LFP responses were preserved, but the CBF responses were suppressed and the PO2 and OIS changes were negative (-12% and -0.28%, respectively). In this condition, the trial-by-trial variations in PO2 and OIS were well correlated with the variability in sigmaLFPs (Rmean= -0.77 and -0.76, respectively), indicating a single trial coupling between CMRO2 changes and sigmaLFP.

Epub 2008 Apr 30.","The central autonomic network (CAN) has been described in animal models but has been difficult to elucidate in humans. Potential confounds include physiological noise artifacts affecting brainstem neuroimaging data, and difficulty in deriving non-invasive continuous assessments of autonomic modulation. We have developed and implemented a new method which relates cardiac-gated fMRI timeseries with continuous-time heart rate variability (HRV) to estimate central autonomic processing. As many autonomic structures of interest are in brain regions strongly affected by cardiogenic pulsatility, we chose to cardiac-gate our fMRI acquisition to increase sensitivity. Cardiac-gating introduces T1-variability, which was corrected by transforming fMRI data to a fixed TR using a previously published method [Guimaraes, A.R., Melcher, J.R., et al., 1998. Imaging subcortical auditory activity in humans. Hum. Brain Mapp. 6(1), 33-41]. The electrocardiogram was analyzed with a novel point process adaptive-filter algorithm for computation of the high-frequency (HF) index, reflecting the time-varying dynamics of efferent cardiovagal modulation. Central command of cardiovagal outflow was inferred by using the resample HF timeseries as a regressor to the fMRI data. A grip task was used to perturb the autonomic nervous system. Our combined HRV-fMRI approach demonstrated HF correlation with fMRI activity in the hypothalamus, cerebellum, parabrachial nucleus/locus ceruleus, periaqueductal gray, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal, posterior insular, and middle temporal cortices. While some regions consistent with central cardiovagal control in animal models gave corroborative evidence for our methodology, other mostly higher cortical or limbic-related brain regions may be unique to humans. Our approach should be optimized and applied to study the human brain correlates of autonomic modulation for various stimuli in both physiological and pathological states.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18524629,Y,corr,,,

To investigate brain substrates of crosstalks between the homeostasis-maintaining systems accompanying appraisal of stressor controllability, we simultaneously recorded regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using 15O-water positron emission tomography, cardiovascular indices (heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP)), neuroendocrine indices (concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in blood), and immune indices (proportions of subsets of lymphocytes (NK cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells) in blood), in 11 male subjects who performed a mental arithmetic task with either high controllability (HC) and low controllability (LC). The LC task resulted in less sense of control in subjects than the HC task. Significant increases of rCBF in the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices (OFC), and in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices (MPFC, LPFC) were observed by subtracting the HC task from the LC task. More importantly, significant positive correlations between rCBF and HR, BP, and NK cells were commonly found in the OFC and MPFC during the LC tasks, but not during the HC tasks.

Psychophysical tests suggested that CT afferents give rise to an inconsistent perception of weak and pleasant touch. By examining two neuronopathy subjects as well as control subjects we have now demonstrated that CT stimulation can elicit a sympathetic skin response. Further, the neuronopathy subjects' ability to localize stimuli which activate CT afferents was very poor but above chance level.

However, the precise link between enhanced visual perception of emotion-laden items and increased visual responses remains poorly understood. To investigate this link, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants performed a challenging visual detection task. Grating stimuli were physically identical and differed only as a function of their previous exposure history; CS+ stimuli were initially paired with shock, whereas CS- stimuli were not. Behaviorally, subjects were both faster and more accurate during CS+ relative to CS- target detection. These behavioral results were paralleled by increases in fMRI responses across early, retinotopically organized visual cortex, which was mapped in a separate fMRI session. Logistic regression analyses revealed that trial-by-trial fluctuations in fMRI responses were closely linked to trial type, such that fMRI signal strength reliably predicted the probability of a hit trial across retinotopically organized visual cortex, including area V1. For instance, during the CS+ condition, a 0.5% signal change increased the probability of a hit from chance to 67.3-73.5% in V1-V4 (the highest increase was observed in area V1). Furthermore, across participants, differential fMRI responses to hits versus correct rejects were correlated with behavioral performance.

No correlations surfaced between change in glucose uptake and depression scores. However, the sample size was small; none remitted; and the range of depression scores was limited.

Therefore, FDG-PET (Siemens, Germany) was performed twice in 14 healthy resting subjects (7 m, 7 f; mean age 29.5 years) while different parameters of autonomic function were assessed simultaneously: Blood pressure, heart rate, power spectra of heart rate variability (HF/LF ratio) and plasma catecholamines. In order to control for attention, subjects had to focus visual affective neutral presentations during the experiment. Correlation analysis was performed as a region of interest analysis using SPM2 software (p<0.001 uncorrected). Sympathetic activity at rest varied substantially between subjects. There were significant positive correlations between increase of regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) of the heads of caudate nuclei on both sides and the HF/LF ratio of heart rate variability. Furthermore, significant negative correlations between both heart rate and plasma catecholamines and rCGM decreases of caudate nuclei heads were found. In addition, there was a positive correlation between plasma catecholamines and primary motor cortex activation. Autonomic nervous system at rest seems to be partially interlocked with activity of motor brain regions - the caudate nuclei and the motor cortex. This might have clinical implications for the understanding of stress-related disorders, which are frequently accompanied by increased sympathetic activity as well as muscle tone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18723403,Y,corr,uns,,

In contrast, mechanisms of nicotine withdrawal have received less attention although subjective withdrawal likely contributes to the difficulty of quitting. The goal of this study was to determine if nicotine withdrawal was associated with alterations of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ventral striatum. Twelve smokers, moderately dependent on nicotine, underwent MR dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging at baseline, after overnight withdrawal from nicotine, and after nicotine replacement. DSC images were used to calculate CBF in three regions of interest: ventral striatum, thalamus, and medial frontal cortex. Subjective withdrawal symptoms were measured at each time point. In spite of significant subjective withdrawal symptoms, there was no main effect of withdrawal on CBF in the three regions. However, there was a significant correlation between the increase in withdrawal symptoms and a reduction in thalamic CBF. In contrast to withdrawal, nicotine replacement significantly increased CBF in ventral striatum. Our findings are consistent with the known role of ventral striatum in drug reward. The lack of a main effect on withdrawal, but correlation of thalamic blood flow with withdrawal symptoms suggests that more complex mechanisms mediate the subjective features of the withdrawal state.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17460613,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, the extent to which dopamine increases reflect a primary rather than a secondary response to the cues remains unclear. Here we evaluated the extent to which dopamine increases by themselves can induce craving in cocaine abusers. Using PET and [(11)C]raclopride (D2 receptor radioligand sensitive to competition with endogenous dopamine) we show that in cocaine abusers (n=20) oral methylphenidate (20 mg), which significantly increased dopamine in striatum, did not induce craving unless subjects were concomitantly exposed to cocaine cues (video scenes of subjects self-administering cocaine). This suggests that dopamine increases associated with conditioned cues are not primary responses but reflect downstream stimulation of dopamine cells (presumably glutamatergic afferents from prefrontal cortex and/or amygdala). Inasmuch as afferent stimulation of dopamine neurons results in phasic cell firing these findings suggest that ""fast"" dopamine increases, in contrast to the ""slow"" dopamine increases as achieved when using oral methylphenidate (mimicking tonic dopamine cell firing), are required for cues to trigger craving. The fact that methylphenidate induced craving only when given with the cocaine cues highlights the context dependency of methylphenidate's effects and suggests that its use for the treatment of ADHD subjects with co-morbid drug abuse should not increase craving.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18024160,N ,clinical,,,

Phobia-specific startle potentiation was maintained and autonomic responses even increased during sustained phobic stimulation. Viewing of spider pictures also resulted in increased activation of the amygdala in spider-phobic participants. This effect, however, was not fear specific because other affective materials evoked comparable signal strength in the amygdala. In contrast, insula activation was specifically increased during sustained phobic exposure in phobic volunteers.

METHODS: Thirty-one non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) patients, 21 in the group of NERD with esophageal hypersensitivity (NERD-H) and 10 in the group of NERD with normal esophageal sensation (NERD-N), 13 patients with erosive esophagitis (EE), and 12 healthy volunteers, all sex- and age-matched, underwent whole brain blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fictional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the cortical fMRI response to intraesophageal perfusion of normal saline or dilute hydrochloric acid. RESULTS: The main centers affected in the NERD-H patients included the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), right prefrontal cortex (PFC), right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insular cortex, amygdala, striatum, motor cortex and its supplementary area, and cerebellum cortices, which form part of the matrix controlling emotional, autonomic modulatory responses to pain. The peak fMRI signal intensity and average maximum percent signal increase in the regions of interest (ROI) at above-mentioned brain areas of the NERD-H group were significantly stronger than those of the NERD-N and control groups (all P < 0.01). The peak image intensity of the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) of NERD-H group was 562 +/- 104, significantly lower than that of the control group (587 +/- 126, P < 0. 05), but significantly higher than that of the EE group (535 +/- 91, P < 0.05). The timeline of activation and deactivation events of particular ROI differentiate the four groups. The initial image latency and peak fMRI latency after hydrochloric acid perfusion of the NERD-H patients were 1.7 min +/- 0.9 min and peak 4. 5 min +/- 1.3 min respectively, both significantly shorter than those of the NERD-N group (4.0 min +/- 1.1 min and 6.8 min +/- 1.6 min respectively, both P < 0.01) and those of the control group (5. 4 min +/- 1.7 min and 7.2 min +/- 1.5 min respectively, both P < 0.01). The range of deactivation of SII and R-PFC of the NERD-H group were 26.5% +/- 5.4% and 20.3% +/- 3. 0% respectively, both significantly greater than those of the NERD-N group (8.2% +/- 2.2% and 16.4% +/- 3.6% respectively, both P < 0.05) and those of the EE group (11.9% +/- 4.8% and 11.7% +/- 3.1% respectively, both P < 0.01).

Reduced high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) characterizes anxiety disordered patients and is predictive of adverse myocardial events. Sex differences in the prevalence of anxiety disorders and cardiac diseases implicate the possibility of sex specific neural regulation of HF-HRV. We investigated the correlation between HF-HRV and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 28 subjects (15 women) with social phobia undergoing a stressful public speaking task. Regional CBF was measured with [(15)O] water positron emission tomography. Stress induced rCBF correlated positively with HF-HRV in the right supra genual anterior cingulate cortex Brodmann's area (BA) 32, the right head of the caudate nucleus and bilaterally in the medial prefrontal cortex (BA10), extending into the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA46) in the left hemisphere. Men showed larger positive co-variation in the caudate than women. These findings underscore the importance of the emotional division of the anterior cingulate cortex, the prefrontal cortex and the striatum in cardiovagal activity.

We investigated whether intense interval training on a cycle ergometer would prevent muscle changes during unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS). METHODS: This study involved 11 healthy men who were divided into 2 groups, one with training on a cycle ergometer (TRN, N=6) and the other a control group (CON, N=5). TRN performed intense interval training (up to 90% of maximum heart rate) on alternate days during 20 d of unloading. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the quadriceps femoris and volume of the thigh muscle were measured before and after unloading. Muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging (mfMRI), which reflects the contractile activity of the activating muscle, were acquired during submaximal dynamic knee extension exercises. RESULTS: The MVC was significantly decreased in TRN (-11.1%) and CON (-18.7%). The total volume of the thigh muscles was maintained in TRN (-0.2%); however, a significant decrease was found in CON (-6.9%). The mfMRI signal increase for submaximal exercise did not change for TRN; however, it significantly increased for CON. CONCLUSIONS: Although the power of this study was limited, these results suggest that training on a cycle ergometer counteracts some of the effects of unloading and merits further study as a potential countermeasure for muscle changes in microgravity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19601509,N,no phys of interest,,,

In theory, detection of threat cues should activate the amygdala independently from allocation of attention. However, previous studies using emotional facial expressions as well as phobic cues yielded contradictory results. We used fMRI to examine whether the allocation of attention to components of superimposed spider and bird displays modulates amygdala activation. Nineteen spider-phobic women were instructed to identify either a moving or a stationary animal in briefly presented double-exposure displays. Amygdala activation followed a dose-response relationship: Compared to congruent neutral displays (two birds), amygdala activation was most pronounced in response to congruent phobic displays (two spiders) and less but still significant in response to mixed displays (spider and bird) when attention was focused on the phobic component. When attention was focused on the neutral component, mixed displays did not result in significant amygdala activation. This was confirmed in a significant parametric graduation of the amygdala activation in the order of congruent phobic displays, mixed displays with attention focus on the spider, mixed displays with focus on the bird and congruent neutral displays. These results challenge the notion that amygdala activation in response to briefly presented phobic cues is independent from attention.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18726545,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, cerebro-vascular diseases can affect blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Cerebral autoregulation is a primary function of cerebral hemodynamics, which allows to maintain a relatively constant blood flow despite changes in arterial blood pressure and perfusion pressure. Cerebral autoregulation is reported to become less effective in the early phases post-stroke. This study investigated whether any impairment of cerebral hemodynamics that occurs during the acute and the subacute phases of ischemic stroke is related to changes in BOLD response. We enrolled six aphasic patients affected by acute stroke. All patients underwent a Transcranial Doppler to assess cerebral autoregulation (Mx index) and fMRI to evaluate the amplitude and the peak latency (time to peak-TTP) of BOLD response in the acute (i.e., within four days of stroke occurrence) and the subacute (i.e., between five and twelve days after stroke onset) stroke phases. RESULTS: As patients advanced from the acute to subacute stroke phase, the affected hemisphere presented a BOLD TTP increase (p = 0.04) and a deterioration of cerebral autoregulation (Mx index increase, p = 0.046). A similar but not significant trend was observed also in the unaffected hemisphere. When the two hemispheres were grouped together, BOLD TTP delay was significantly related to worsening cerebral autoregulation (Mx index increase) (Spearman's rho = 0.734; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The hemodynamic response function subtending BOLD signal may present a delay in peak latency that arises as patients advance from the acute to the subacute stroke phase. This delay is related to the deterioration of cerebral hemodynamics. These findings suggest that remodeling the fMRI hemodynamic response function in the different phases of stroke may optimize the detection of BOLD signal changes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20021696,N,no phys of interest,,,

DESIGN: Patients with OSA and controls were compared on performance and brain activation during a sustained attention task. The association of reaction time and brain activation with apnea-hypopnea index, nocturnal hypoxia, and arousals was assessed. SETTING: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted while participants performed a Go-No-Go task. The 'Go' trials of the Go-No-Go task were used to index attention processing. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen patients with OSA and 14 normal control subjects with equivalent age, body mass index, blood pressure, and education. INTERVENTIONS: N/A.

Within the patients with OSA, increasing arousal index, but not desaturation index, was associated with slower mean reaction time and with decreased brain activation in areas involved in arousal and attention, response selection, motor response, and decision making. The apnea-hypopnea index, by itself, was not associated with changes in cerebral response.

We proposed that this acupuncture-related dichotomy may represent the anticorrelation in these intrinsic brain networks showing spontaneous fluctuations during rest. According to a plentiful clinical report, acupuncture can provide pain relief beyond the time it is being administrated; therefore, imaging its sustained effect (rather than acute effect) on the brain networks may further help elucidate the mechanisms by which acupuncture achieves its therapeutic effects. As an interface, the anterior insula (AI) has recently been shown to be a network hub, which initiates dynamic switching between these intrinsic networks. Here, we attempt to explore how acupuncture can modulate spontaneous coherences of these resting networks anchored by the AI. Using a spontaneous activity detection approach, we identified an AI-related dichotomy showing spontaneous activations in the CEN along with wide spontaneous deactivations located exclusively in the DMN. Following verum acupuncture, but not sham control, there was a prominently enhanced dichotomy in the CEN and DMN networks. More importantly, a long-lasting effect of acupuncture could further modulate intrinsic coherences of the wide interoceptive-autonomic areas, including the paralimbic regions and brainstem nuclei. These findings suggested that acupuncture may not only enhance the dichotomy of the anticorrelated resting networks, but also modulate a larger spatio-temporal extent of spontaneous activities in the salient interoceptive-autonomic network, contributing to potential actions in the endogenous pain-modulation circuits and homeostatic control mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19427842,N,no corr,,,

To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive task performance and endogenous fMRI oscillations in an experiment designed to answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively effortful task significantly change fractal scaling properties of fMRI time series compared to their values before task performance? 2) If so, can we relate the extent of task-related perturbation to the difficulty of the task? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a novel continuous acquisition ""rest-task-rest"" design, we found that endogenous dynamics tended to recover their pre-task parameter values relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one of two versions of the n-back working memory task and that the rate of recovery was slower following completion of the more demanding (n = 2) version of the task. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This result supports the model that endogenous low frequency oscillatory dynamics are relevant to the brain's response to exogenous stimulation.

Despite their apparent importance in recreational and potential psychotherapeutic use of MDMA, the defining characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of these interpersonal effects are poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated acute effects of MDMA on self-reported sociability and neuronal activation in response to socially threatening (angry and fearful faces) and socially rewarding (happy faces) stimuli. Assessment of social threat response focused on amygdala activation, whereas assessment of social reward focused on ventral striatum activation. Healthy volunteers (N = 9) reporting past ecstasy use completed three experimental sessions, receiving MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) and placebo (PBO) under double-blind conditions. During peak drug effects, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing standardized images depicting emotional facial expressions including angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. They also completed standardized self-report measures of sociability. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased self-reported sociability compared to MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) and PBO. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated left amygdala response to angry facial expressions compared to PBO, but MDMA did not affect amygdala reactivity to fearful expressions. MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) enhanced ventral striatum response to happy expressions relative to PBO.

Epub 2009 May 19.","Variations in the subject's heart rate and breathing pattern have been shown to result in significant fMRI signal changes, mediated in part by non-neuronal physiological mechanisms such as global changes in levels of arterial CO(2). When these physiological changes are correlated with a task, as may happen in response to emotional stimuli or tasks that change levels of arousal, a concern arises that non-neuronal physiologically-induced signal changes may be misinterpreted as reflecting task-related neuronal activation. The purpose of this study is to provide information that can help in determining whether task activation maps are influenced by task-correlated physiological noise, particularly task-correlated breathing changes. We also compare different strategies to reduce the influence of physiological noise. Two paradigms are investigated--1) a lexical decision task where some subjects showed task-related breathing changes, and 2) a task where subjects were instructed to hold their breath during the presentation of contrast-reversing checkerboard, an extreme case of task-correlated physiological noise. Consistent with previous literature, we find that MRI signal changes correlated with variations in breathing depth and rate have a characteristic spatial and temporal profile that is different from the typical activation-induced BOLD response. The delineation of activation in the presence of task correlated breathing changes was improved either by independent component analysis, or by including specific nuisance regressors in a regression analysis. The difference in the spatial and temporal characteristics of physiological-induced and neuronal-induced fluctuations exploited by these strategies suggests that activation can be studied even in the presence of task-correlated physiological changes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19460443,N,methods paper,,,

An increasing demand for treatment of cannabis dependence has refueled the discussion about the addictive potential of cannabis. A key feature of all addictive drugs is the ability to increase synaptic dopamine levels in the striatum, a mechanism involved in their rewarding and motivating effects. However, it is currently unknown if cannabis can stimulate striatal dopamine neurotransmission in humans. Here we show that Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis, induces dopamine release in the human striatum. Using the dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor tracer [(11)C]raclopride and positron emission tomography in seven healthy subjects, we demonstrate that THC inhalation reduces [(11)C]raclopride binding in the ventral striatum and the precommissural dorsal putamen but not in other striatal subregions. This is consistent with an increase in dopamine levels in these regions. These results suggest that THC shares a potentially addictive property with other drugs of abuse. Further, it implies that the endogenous cannabinoid system is involved in regulating striatal dopamine release. This allows new directions in research on the effects of THC in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18754005,N,no phys of interest,,,

The first aim of the present study was to observe how rinsing the mouth with solutions containing glucose and maltodextrin, disguised with artificial sweetener, would affect exercise performance. The second aim was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the brain regions activated by these substances. In Study 1A, eight endurance-trained cyclists (VO2max 60.8 +/- 4.1 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) completed a cycle time trial (total work = 914 +/- 29 kJ) significantly faster when rinsing their mouths with a 6.4% glucose solution compared with a placebo containing saccharin (60.4 +/- 3.7 and 61.6 +/- 3.8 min, respectively, P = 0.007). The corresponding fMRI study (Study 1B) revealed that oral exposure to glucose activated reward-related brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex and striatum, which were unresponsive to saccharin. In Study 2A, eight endurance-trained cyclists (VO2max 57.8 +/- 3.2 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) tested the effect of rinsing with a 6.4% maltodextrin solution on exercise performance, showing it to significantly reduce the time to complete the cycle time trial (total work = 837 +/- 68 kJ) compared to an artificially sweetened placebo (62.6 +/- 4.7 and 64.6 +/- 4.9 min, respectively, P = 0.012). The second neuroimaging study (Study 2B) compared the cortical response to oral maltodextrin and glucose, revealing a similar pattern of brain activation in response to the two carbohydrate solutions, including areas of the insula/frontal operculum, orbitofrontal cortex and striatum. The results suggest that the improvement in exercise performance that is observed when carbohydrate is present in the mouth may be due to the activation of brain regions believed to be involved in reward and motor control. The findings also suggest that there may be a class of so far unidentified oral receptors that respond to carbohydrate independently of those for sweetness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19237430,N,no phys of interest,,,

It is observed that the voxel-wise morphology of the deconvolved RV responses is preserved when HR is included in the model, and that its form is adequately modeled by Birn et al.'s previously-described respiration response function.

Epub 2009 May 14.","Previous studies have reported that the spontaneous, resting-state time course of the default-mode network is negatively correlated with that of the ""task-positive network"", a collection of regions commonly recruited in demanding cognitive tasks. However, all studies of negative correlations between the default-mode and task-positive networks have employed some form of normalization or regression of the whole-brain average signal (""global signal""); these processing steps alter the time series of voxels in an uninterpretable manner as well as introduce spurious negative correlations. Thus, the extent of negative correlations with the default mode network without global signal removal has not been well characterized, and it is has recently been hypothesized that the apparent negative correlations in many of the task-positive regions could be artifactually induced by global signal pre-processing. The present study aimed to examine negative and positive correlations with the default-mode network when model-based corrections for respiratory and cardiac noise are applied in lieu of global signal removal. Physiological noise correction consisted of (1) removal of time-locked cardiac and respiratory artifacts using RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI: RETROICOR. Magn. Reson. Med. 44, 162-167), and (2) removal of low-frequency respiratory and heart rate variations by convolving these waveforms with pre-determined transfer functions (Birn et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2009) and projecting the resulting two signals out of the data. It is demonstrated that negative correlations between the default-mode network and regions of the task-positive network are present in the majority of individual subjects both with and without physiological noise correction. Physiological noise correction increased the spatial extent and magnitude of negative correlations, yielding negative correlations within task-positive regions at the group-level (p<0.05, uncorrected; no regions at the group level were significant at FDR=0.05). Furthermore, physiological noise correction caused region-specific decreases in positive correlations within the default-mode network, reducing apparent false positives. It was observed that the low-frequency respiratory volume and cardiac rate regressors used within the physiological noise correction algorithm displayed significant (but not total) shared variance with the global signal, and constitute a model-based alternative to correcting for non-neural global noise.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19446646,N,no corr,,,

However, the influence of negative emotion on brain processing of painful visceral sensations has not been investigated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and negative emotional stimuli to investigate the effects of negative emotion on brain processing of esophageal sensation. METHODS: Twelve healthy male volunteers (age range, 21-32 years) participated in the study. Negative emotion was induced using emotionally valent music. fMRI images were acquired during 2 experimental runs; throughout these, volunteers received randomized nonpainful and painful distentions to the esophagus during neutral and negative emotion. Subjective perception of each stimulus was acquired, as were mood ratings. RESULTS: Sadness ratings increased significantly following negative mood induction (P < .01). There was no significant effect of emotion on subjective perception of painful and nonpainful stimulation (P > .05). Following painful stimulation, brain activity increased in the right hemisphere during negative emotion and was localized to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA24/32), anterior insula, and inferior frontal gyrus. Following nonpainful stimulation during negative emotion, brain activity increased in the right anterior insula and ACC (BA24 and 32). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new information about the influence of negative affect on central processing of visceral pain. Evidence of right hemispheric dominance during negative emotion indicates this hemisphere is predominately associated with sympathetic activity (arousal, negative affect) and that the right insula and right ACC are integral to subjective awareness of emotion through interoception.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19582887,N,no corr,,,

Fearful and neutral faces presented with rings of different colors were used as stimuli. During the conditioning phase, fearful faces presented with a certain ring color (e.g., black) were paired with mild electrical stimulation. Neutral faces shown with rings of that color, as well as fearful or neutral faces shown with another ring color (e.g., white), were never paired with shock. Our findings revealed that fearful faces evoked enhanced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses in V1 and V4 compared to neutral faces. Faces embedded in a color ring that was paired with shock (e.g., black) evoked greater BOLD responses in V1-V4 compared to a ring color that was never paired with shock (e.g., white). Finally, BOLD responses in early visual cortex were tightly interrelated (i.e., correlated) during an affectively potent context (i.e., ring color) but not during a neutral one, suggesting that increased functional integration was present with affective learning. Taken together, the results suggest that task-irrelevant affective information not only influences evoked responses in early, retinotopically organized visual cortex, but also determines the pattern of responses across early visual cortex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19410587,N,no phys of interest,,,

Less is known, however, about the role of the amygdala and the striatum in learning how to exert control over emotions and avoid negative outcomes. One potential mechanism for active avoidance of stressful situations is postulated to involve amygdala-striatal interactions. The goal of this study was to investigate the physiological and neural correlates underlying avoidance learning in humans. Specifically, we used a classical conditioning paradigm where three different conditioned stimuli (CS) were presented. One stimulus predicted the delivery of a shock upon stimulus offset (CS+), while another predicted no negative consequences (CS-). A third conditioned cue also predicted delivery of a shock, but participants were instructed that upon seeing this stimulus, they could avoid the shock if they chose the correct action (AV+). After successful learning, participants could then easily terminate the shock during subsequent stimulus presentations (AV-). Physiological responses (as measured by skin conductance responses) confirmed a main effect of conditioning, particularly showing higher arousal responses during pre (AV+) compared to post (AV-) learning of an avoidance response. Consistent with animal models, amygdala-striatal interactions were observed to underlie the acquisition of an avoidance response. These results support a mechanism of active coping with conditioned fear that allows for the control over emotional responses such as fears that can become maladaptive and influence our decision-making.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19847311,N,no phys of interest,,,

Data analysis approaches typically use averaging or linear regression to remove this physiological baseline with varying degrees of success.

In the present work, a biophysical model of systemic and cerebral circulation and gas exchange is applied to resting state NIRS neuroimaging data from 10 human subjects. The model further includes dynamic cerebral autoregulation, which modulates the cerebral arteriole compliance to control cerebral blood flow. This biophysical model allows for prediction, from noninvasive blood pressure measurements, of the background hemodynamic fluctuations in the systemic and cerebral circulations. Significantly higher correlations with the NIRS data were found using the biophysical model predictions compared to blood pressure regression and compared to transfer function analysis (multifactor ANOVA, p<0.0001).

Several of those brain areas may also contribute to the monitoring and regulation of autonomic activity but this aspect of pain responses has been largely overlooked in human imaging studies. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study relied on blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal to investigate subject-related differences in brain activity associated with the individual differences in electrodermal responses evoked by 30 s noxious (pain) and innocuous (warm) thermal stimuli. Pain-related activity (pain-warm) was found in the thalamus, somatosensory cortices (leg area of SI/MI, SII, and insula), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the amygdala. Brain activation related to stimulus-evoked electrodermal activity was identified by modeling the predicted BOLD responses with the magnitude of each subject's skin conductance reactivity. Subjects showing larger skin conductance reactivity to the innocuous and/or noxious stimuli displayed larger stimulus-evoked brain responses in the somato-motor cortices (SI/MI, SII, and insula), the perigenual and supracallosal ACC, the orbitofrontal cortex and the medulla. Further analyses revealed brain activation more specifically associated with the pain-related skin conductance reactivity in the supracallosal ACC, amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus.

During waking spontaneous breathing, cognitive and emotional demands can modulate the intrinsic brainstem respiratory rhythm. However the neural circuitry mediating this modulation is unknown. Studies of supra-pontine influences on the control of breathing have implicated limbic/paralimbic-bulbar circuitry, but these studies have been limited to either invasive surgical electrophysiological methods or neuroimaging during substantial respiratory provocation. Here we probed the limbic/paralimbic-bulbar circuitry for respiratory-related neural activity during unlabored spontaneous breathing at rest as well as during a challenging cognitive task (sustained random number generation). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous physiological monitoring (heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume, end-tidal CO(2)) was acquired in 14 healthy subjects during each condition. The cognitive task produced expected increases in breathing rate, while end-tidal CO(2) and heart rate did not significantly differ between conditions. The respiratory cycle served as the input function for breath-by-breath, event-related, voxel-wise, random-effects image analyses in SPM5.

To test if this finding applies to other major classical acupoints, fMRI was performed on 10 healthy adults during manual acupuncture at Taichong (LV3), Xingjian (LV2), Neiting (ST44), and a sham point on the dorsum of the left foot. Although certain differences could be observed between real and sham points, the hemodynamic response (BOLD signal changes) and psychophysical response (sensory experience) to acupuncture were generally similar for all four points.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in normal human subjects during the tactile exploration of novel stimuli from a related set of textures and patterns, as well as from a set of aversive tactile stimuli, was compared with CBF during a control condition involving familiar tactile stimuli. The results demonstrate that the right rostral orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the active encoding of novel tactile information, while a more caudal region of the orbitofrontal cortex, which is more closely connected with limbic and autonomic regions of the brain, was activated when subjects explored novel aversive tactile stimuli. These results suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex, through its connections with the limbic areas of the medial temporal lobe, influences the processing of incoming information and thus contributes to its encoding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18172850,N,no phys of interest,,,

The neurophysiological substrates of these effects are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of 2 main psychoactive constituents of Cannabis sativa (Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol [Delta9-THC] and cannabidiol [CBD]) on regional brain function during emotional processing. DESIGN: Subjects were studied on 3 separate occasions using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm while viewing faces that implicitly elicited different levels of anxiety. Each scanning session was preceded by the ingestion of either 10 mg of Delta9-THC, 600 mg of CBD, or a placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen healthy, English-native, right-handed men who had used cannabis 15 times or less in their life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional brain activation (blood oxygenation level-dependent response), electrodermal activity (skin conductance response [SCR]), and objective and subjective ratings of anxiety. RESULTS: Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol increased anxiety, as well as levels of intoxication, sedation, and psychotic symptoms, whereas there was a trend for a reduction in anxiety following administration of CBD. The number of SCR fluctuations during the processing of intensely fearful faces increased following administration of Delta9-THC but decreased following administration of CBD. Cannabidiol attenuated the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the amygdala and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex while subjects were processing intensely fearful faces, and its suppression of the amygdalar and anterior cingulate responses was correlated with the concurrent reduction in SCR fluctuations. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol mainly modulated activation in frontal and parietal areas. CONCLUSIONS: Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD had clearly distinct effects on the neural, electrodermal, and symptomatic response to fearful faces. The effects of CBD on activation in limbic and paralimbic regions may contribute to its ability to reduce autonomic arousal and subjective anxiety, whereas the anxiogenic effects of Delta9-THC may be related to effects in other brain regions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19124693,N,pharma study,,,

Participants were scanned in a perceptual control condition and while physically executing or focusing during motor imagery on either the visual or kinesthetic components of an explicitly known sequence of finger movements. Subjects' imagery abilities were assessed using well-established psychological, chronometric, and new physiological measures from the autonomic nervous system. Compared with the perceptual condition, physical executing, VI, and KI resulted in overlapping (albeit non-identical) brain activations, including motor-related regions and the inferior and superior parietal lobules. By contrast, a divergent pattern of increased activity was observed when VI and KI were compared directly: VI activated predominantly the occipital regions and the superior parietal lobules, whereas KI yielded more activity in motor-associated structures and the inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that VI and KI are mediated through separate neural systems, which contribute differently during processes of motor learning and neurological rehabilitation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18819106,N,no phys of interest,,,

Inflammatory cytokines are implicated in coordinating this central motivational reorientation accompanying peripheral immunologic responses to pathogens. Studies in rodents suggest an afferent interoceptive neural mechanism, although comparable data in humans are lacking. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized crossover study, 16 healthy male volunteers received typhoid vaccination or saline (placebo) injection in two experimental sessions. Profile of Mood State questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 2 and 3 hours. Two hours after injection, participants performed a high-demand color word Stroop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Blood samples were performed at baseline and immediately after scanning. RESULTS: Typhoid but not placebo injection produced a robust inflammatory response indexed by increased circulating interleukin-6 accompanied by a significant increase in fatigue, confusion, and impaired concentration at 3 hours. Performance of the Stroop task under inflammation activated brain regions encoding representations of internal bodily state. Spatial and temporal characteristics of this response are consistent with interoceptive information flow via afferent autonomic fibers. During performance of this task, activity within interoceptive brain regions also predicted individual differences in inflammation-associated but not placebo-associated fatigue and confusion. Maintenance of cognitive performance, despite inflammation-associated fatigue, led to recruitment of additional prefrontal cortical regions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that peripheral infection selectively influences central nervous system function to generate core symptoms of sickness and reorient basic motivational states.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19409533,N,no phys of interest,,,

We examined how, independent of facial emotional expression, dynamic coherence between one's own and another's pupil size modulates regional brain activity. Fourteen subjects viewed pairs of eye stimuli while undergoing fMRI. Using continuous pupillometry biofeedback, the size of the observed pupils was varied, correlating positively or negatively with changes in participants' own pupils. Viewing both static and dynamic stimuli activated right fusiform gyrus. Observing dynamically changing pupils activated STS and amygdala, regions engaged by non-static and salient facial features. Discordance between observed and observer's pupillary changes enhanced activity within bilateral anterior insula, left amygdala and anterior cingulate. In contrast, processing positively correlated pupils enhanced activity within left frontal operculum. Our findings suggest pupillary signals are monitored continuously during social interactions and that incongruent changes activate brain regions involved in tracking motivational salience and attentionally meaningful information. Naturalistically, dynamic coherence in pupillary change follows fluctuations in ambient light. Correspondingly, in social contexts discordant pupil response is likely to reflect divergence of dispositional state. Our data provide empirical evidence for an autonomically mediated extension of forward models of motor control into social interaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19048432,M,contrast?,,,

To study if facial feedback effects on limbic brain responses during intentional imitation of facial expressions, we applied botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced denervation of frown muscles in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging as a reversible lesion model to minimize the occurrence of afferent muscular and cutaneous input. We show that, during imitation of angry facial expressions, reduced feedback due to BTX treatment attenuates activation of the left amygdala and its functional coupling with brain stem regions implicated in autonomic manifestations of emotional states. These findings demonstrate that facial feedback modulates neural activity within central circuitries of emotion during intentional imitation of facial expressions.

The symptoms have not been explained by peripheral mechanisms alone nor by specific central nervous system mechanisms. In this study, we objectively evaluated the cerebral response to individually calibrated pain provocations of a pain-free body region (thumbnail). The study comprised 16 female FMS patients and 16 individually age-matched controls. Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during individually calibrated painful pressures representing 50 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 mm. Patients exhibited higher sensitivity to pain provocation than controls as they required less pressure to evoke equal pain magnitudes (U(A)=48, p<.002). Despite lower pressures applied in patients at VAS 50 mm, the fMRI-analysis revealed no difference in activity in brain regions relating to attention and affect or regions with sensory projections from the stimulated body area. However, in the primary link in the descending pain regulating system (the rostral anterior cingulate cortex) the patients failed to respond to pain provocation. The attenuated response to pain in this brain region is the first demonstration of a specific brain region where the impairment of pain inhibition in FMS patients is expressed. These results validate previous reports of dysfunctional endogenous pain inhibition in FMS and advance the understanding of the central pathophysiologic mechanisms, providing a new direction for the development of successful treatments in FMS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19410366,N,no phys of interest,,,

Yet, the neural bases underlying these processes have not been investigated so far. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore neural activations of classical conditioning of sexual arousal with respect to sex differences and contingency awareness. METHODS: In the acquisition phase, a geometric figure (CS+) was presented for 8 seconds and was followed by highly sexual arousing pictures (UCS), whereas another figure (CS-) predicted neutral pictures. Ratings and contingency awareness were assessed after the entire conditioning procedure. Forty subjects (20 females) were classified into one of four groups according to their sex and the development of contingency awareness (aware females, aware males, unaware females, and unaware males). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), skin conductance responses (SCRs), and subjective ratings. RESULTS: fMRI analysis showed two effects (awareness and sex) when comparing CS+ with CS-: (i) aware compared to unaware subjects showed enhanced differentiation (e.g., ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, occipital cortex); and (ii) men showed increased activity compared to women in the amygdala, thalamus, and brainstem. CS+ and CS- ratings differed in aware subjects only. However, no conditioned SCRs occurred in any group. CONCLUSION: The increased activity in men is in line with theories postulating that men are generally more prone to conditioning of sexual arousal. Further, contingency awareness seems to be an important factor in appetitive learning processes, which facilitates conditioning processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656273,N,no scr,,,

Epub 2008 Oct 7.","One way of investigating affective learning is the use of aversive pictures as unconditioned stimuli (UCS) in conditioning paradigms. In the last decades, there has been a heated debate on the influence of contingency awareness on conditioned responses (CRs). Only a few studies found CRs in contingency unaware subjects whereas other studies only reported conditioned reactions in contingency aware participants. However, as a shortcoming, most studies employing picture-picture paradigms only investigated one response level (e.g. changes in subjective ratings). Further, changes in brain activity have so far been neglected in this field of research. The aim of the present study was to investigate different response levels with respect to contingency awareness: brain activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), skin conductance responses (SCRs) and valence ratings. A neutral geometric shape (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was followed by aversive pictures, whereas another shape (CS-) preceded neutral pictures. Unaware participants showed CRs in brain activity (e.g. the insula). Generally more activity was observed in the fear network (e.g. the amygdala, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex) in aware participants and in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Investigation of SCRs and valence ratings revealed that only aware participants showed conditioned reactions. Our results point toward dissociations between response levels (e.g. brain activity) not affected by contingency awareness and more cognitive response levels (e.g. subjective ratings and SCRs) which are affected by contingency awareness. As a unique finding in human aversive conditioning, we discuss the role of the nucleus accumbens as well as practical implications for affective learning models.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18976695,N,no corr,,,

Headache was induced in all but one subject on both study days. Sildenafil did not affect VEP amplitude or latency (P100). The fMRI response to visual stimulation or hypercapnia was unchanged by sildenafil. In conclusion, sildenafil induces mild headache without potentiating a neuronal or local cerebrovascular visual response or a global cerebrovascular hypercapnic response.

At the psychophysiological level we found increased skin conductance level in response to aversive relative to neutral pictures. However, there was no association of state negative affect with skin conductance level. At the neural level we found that high state negative affect was associated with increased left insular activity during passive viewing of aversive stimuli. The insula has been implicated in interoceptive processes and in the integration of sensory, visceral, and affective information thus contributing to subjective emotional experience. Greater recruitment of the insula in response to aversive relative to neutral stimuli in subjects with high state negative affect may represent increased processing of salient aversive stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18632198,Y,corr,rand,,

Epub 2009 Sep 12.","BACKGROUND: A clinical characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is persistently elevated fear responses to stimuli associated with the traumatic event. The objective herein is to determine whether extinction of fear responses is impaired in PTSD and whether such impairment is related to dysfunctional activation of brain regions known to be involved in fear extinction, viz., amygdala, hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). METHODS: Sixteen individuals diagnosed with PTSD and 15 trauma-exposed non-PTSD control subjects underwent a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol in a 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Conditioning and extinction training were conducted on day 1. Extinction recall (or extinction memory) test was conducted on day 2 (extinguished conditioned stimuli presented in the absence of shock). Skin conductance response (SCR) was scored throughout the experiment as an index of the conditioned response. RESULTS: The SCR data revealed no significant differences between groups during acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear on day 1. On day 2, however, PTSD subjects showed impaired recall of extinction memory. Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed greater amygdala activation in the PTSD group during day 1 extinction learning. During extinction recall, lesser activation in hippocampus and vmPFC and greater activation in dACC were observed in the PTSD group. The magnitude of extinction memory across all subjects was correlated with activation of hippocampus and vmPFC during extinction recall testing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that fear extinction is impaired in PTSD. They further suggest that dysfunctional activation in brain structures that mediate fear extinction learning, and especially its recall, underlie this impairment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748076,N,no phys of interest,,,

It also includes a sympathetic response that can be captured by measuring the electrodermal activity (EDA). The present study was performed to investigate which brain areas are associated with sympathetic activation in experimental pain; an issue that has not been addressed with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) thus far. Twelve healthy subjects received painful laser stimulation to the left hand. The event-related fMRI BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) response was measured together with simultaneous EEG (electroencephalography) and EDA recordings. Laser stimuli induced the expected EDA response, evoked EEG potentials and BOLD responses. Single trial EDA amplitudes were used to guide further analysis of fMRI and EEG data. We found significantly higher BOLD responses in trials with high EDA vs. low EDA trials, predominantly in the insula and somatosensory cortex (S1/S2). Likewise, in the EEG we found the N2 laser evoked potentials to have significantly higher amplitudes in trials with high vs. low EDA. Furthermore EDA-informed BOLD modeling explained additional signal variance in sensory areas and yielded higher group level activation. We conclude that the sympathetic response to pain is associated with activation in pain-processing brain regions, predominantly in sensory areas and that single trial (EDA)-information can add to BOLD modeling by taking some of the response variability across trials and subjects into account. Thus, EDA is a useful additional, objective index when pain is studied with fMRI/EEG which might be of particular relevance in the context of genetic- and pharmacoimaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848631,M,EDA orthogonalized,,,

Three broad explanations that might account for such performance decrements are attentional competition (distraction theories), inhibition by conscious processes (explicit-monitoring theories), and excessive drive and arousal (overmotivation theories). Here, we report incentive-dependent performance decrements in humans in a reward-pursuit task; subjects were less successful in capturing a more valuable reward in a computerized maze. Concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that increased activity in ventral midbrain, a brain area associated with incentive motivation and basic reward responding, correlated with both reduced number of captures and increased number of near-misses associated with imminent high rewards.

Brain activity was inferred from measurement using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Effort was measured physiologically using electrodermal responses (EDR) and subjectively using the Borg scale. On average, the Borg score for the Hard task was significantly higher (p=0.007) than for the Easy task (2.9+/-1.1 vs. 1.4+/-0.7, respectively). Similarly, the average normalized peak-to-peak amplitude of the EDR was significantly higher (p=0.002) for the Hard task than for the Easy task (20.4+/-6.5% vs. 12.1+/-4.9%, respectively). The Hard task produced increases in sensorimotor network activation, including supplementary motor area, premotor, sensorimotor and parietal cortices, cerebellum and thalamus. When the imaging data were subdivided based on Borg score, there was an increase in activation and involvement of additional areas, including extrastriate and prefrontal cortices. Subdividing the data based on EDR amplitude produced greater effects including activation of the premotor and parietal cortices. These results show that the effort required for task performance influences the interpretation of fMRI data.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sixty-five subjects received fMRI scans while passively viewing angry, fearful, happy, and neutral facial stimuli. Subjects also completed a trait anxiety inventory, and were monitored using ambulatory wake ECG. The ECG data were analyzed for heart rate variability, a measure of autonomic regulation. The fMRI data were analyzed with respect to six limbic regions (bilateral amygdala, bilateral hippocampus, Brodmann Areas 9, 45) using limbic time-series cross-correlations, maximum BOLD amplitude, and BOLD amplitude at each point in the time-series. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: Diminished coupling between limbic time-series in response to the neutral, fearful, and happy faces was associated with greater trait anxiety, greater sympathetic activation, and lowered heart rate variability. Individuals with greater levels of trait anxiety showed delayed activation of Brodmann Area 45 in response to the fearful and happy faces, and lowered Brodmann Area 45 activation with prolonged left amygdala activation in response to the neutral faces. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamics support limbic regulation as a control system, in which dysregulation, as assessed by diminished coupling between limbic time-series, is associated with increased trait anxiety and excitatory autonomic outputs. Trait-anxious individuals showed delayed inhibitory activation in response to overt-affect stimuli and diminished inhibitory activation with delayed extinction of excitatory activation in response to ambiguous-affect stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18041716,N,no corr,,,

Specifially, lymphocyte redistribution is somewhat attenuated when a stressor is uncontrollable, probably to save biological energy in a situation where appropriate coping is unclear. We infer that this phenomenon might reflect top-down regulation over peripheral immune function by higher-ordered brain regions. To investigate the neural basis of such a phenomenon, we simultaneously recorded regional cerebral blood flow using (15)O-water positron emission tomography and cardiovascular (blood pressure and heart rate), neuroendocrine (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone), and immune (proportions of NK cells and helper T cells in blood) indices in 16 male subjects who performed a stochastic learning task with manipulation of controllability (controllable vs. uncontrollable). Consistent with previous studies, the proportion of peripheral NK cells was attenuated in an uncontrollable stress condition. The dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices were activated in the uncontrollable situation but not in the controllable condition, and additionally, these prefrontal brain regions significantly correlated with the degree of redistribution of NK cells in the uncontrollable condition. The results of the study suggest these brain regions are involved in both evaluation of the controllability of a stressor and regulation of immune function.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19427910,N,no phys of interest,,,

Similar impairments are seen in various psychiatric disorders that are associated with higher susceptibility to stress and with prefrontal cortical dysfunctions, suggesting that acute stress may play a potential role in such dysfunctions. However, it remains unknown whether acute stress has immediate effects on WM-related prefrontal activity. METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated neural activity of 27 healthy female participants during a blocked WM task (numerical N-back) while moderate psychological stress was induced by viewing strongly aversive (vs. neutral) movie material together with a self-referencing instruction. To assess stress manipulation, autonomic and endocrine, as well as subjective, measurements were acquired throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Successfully induced acute stress resulted in significantly reduced WM-related activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and was accompanied by less deactivation in brain regions that are jointly referred to as the default mode network. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that experimentally induced acute stress in healthy volunteers results in a reduction of WM-related DLPFC activity and reallocation of neural resources away from executive function networks. These effects may be explained by supraoptimal levels of catecholamines potentially in conjunction with elevated levels of cortisol. A similar mechanism involving acute stress as a mediating factor may play an important role in higher-order cognitive deficits and hypofrontality observed in various psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19403118,N,no corr,,,

Furthermore, previous studies have shown that active listening tasks strongly modulate AC activations (Petkov et al., 2004; Fritz et al., 2005; Polley et al., 2006). However, the task dependence of AC activations has not been systematically investigated. In the present study, we applied high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging of the AC and adjacent areas to compare activations during pitch discrimination and n-back pitch memory tasks that were varied parametrically in difficulty. We found that anterior AC activations were increased during discrimination but not during memory tasks, while activations in the inferior parietal lobule posterior to the AC were enhanced during memory tasks but not during discrimination. We also found that wide areas of the anterior AC and anterior insula were strongly deactivated during the pitch memory tasks. While these results are consistent with the proposition that the anterior and posterior AC belong to functionally separate auditory processing streams, our results show that this division is present also between tasks using spatially invariant sounds.

Several authors propose some form of cognitive processing to underlie BOLD signal changes in the DMN as activity within the network is modulated by the level of effort required by the task and is positively correlated with self-referential processing. Alternatively, BOLD signal changes within the DMN may be caused by cardiorespiratory processes (CR) affecting BOLD signal measurements independent of neuronal activity. The goal of this study is to investigate whether BOLD signal changes within the DMN can be explained by CR effects. To this aim, brain activity, heartbeat, and respiration are measured during resting-state and while subjects perform a cognitive task with a high- and low-demand condition. To correct for CR effects we used RETROICOR (Glover et al., [2000]: Magn Reson Med 44:162-167) in combination with additive linear modeling of changes due to respiration volume, heart rate and heart rate variability. CR effects were present within the frequency-range of the DMN and were located in areas of the DMN, but equally so in other areas. After removal of CR effects, deactivation and resting-state connectivity between the areas of the DMN remained significant. In addition, DMN deactivation was still modulated by task demand. The same CR correction method did remove activation in task-related areas. We take these results to indicate that the BOLD signal within the DMN cannot be explained by CR effects alone and is possibly related to some form of cognitive neuronal processing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19180557,N,methods paper,,,

The amygdala is thought to regulate this process, but in humans, acute stress and amygdala function have up to now only been studied in isolation. Hence, we developed an integrated design using functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the immediate effects of controlled stress induction on amygdala function. METHODS: In 27 healthy female participants, we studied brain responses to emotional facial stimuli, embedded in an either acutely stressful or neutral context by means of adjoining movie clips. RESULTS: A variety of physiological and psychological measures confirmed successful induction of moderate levels of acute stress. More importantly, this context manipulation shifted the amygdala toward higher sensitivity as well as lower specificity, that is, stress induction augmented amygdala responses to equally high levels for threat-related and positively valenced stimuli, thereby diminishing a threat-selective response pattern. Additionally, stress amplified sensory processing in early visual regions and the face responsive area of the fusiform gyrus but not in a frontal region involved in task execution. CONCLUSIONS: A shift of amygdala function toward heightened sensitivity with lower levels of specificity suggests a state of indiscriminate hypervigilance under stress. Although this represents initial survival value in adverse situations where the risk for false negatives in the detection of potential threats should be minimized, it might similarly play a causative role in the sequelae of traumatic events.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19596123,N,no corr,,,

However, ACA V(mean) was increased from rest during both isometric (+15 +/- 1%) and rhythmic (+15 +/- 2%, voluntary exercise P < 0.05) but remained unchanged during stimulated exercise (P > 0.05). Isometric and rhythmic exercise-induced increases in blood pressure and cardiac output were similar during voluntary and stimulated exercise (P > 0.05 between conditions). Blood pressure remained elevated during PEMI after all exercise conditions (P < 0.05 vs. rest), whereas cardiac output and ACA V(mean) were not different from rest (P > 0.05). Pet(CO2) was unchanged from rest throughout. These data suggest that selective activation of skeletal muscle afferents (i.e., stretch, PEMI, or stimulated exercise) does not increase ACA V(mean) and that increases in ACA V(mean) during volitional contractions of an exercising calf muscle are dependent on the presence of central command.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19679744,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2009 May 22.","Social threat is a key component of mental ""stress"" and a potent generator of negative emotions and physiological responses in the body. How the human brain processes social context and drives peripheral physiology, however, is relatively poorly understood. Human neuroimaging and animal studies implicate the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), though this heterogeneous region is likely to contain multiple sub-regions with diverse relationships with physiological reactivity and regulation. We used fMRI combined with a novel multi-level path analysis approach to identify brain mediators of the effects of a public speech preparation task (social evaluative threat, SET) on heart rate (HR). This model provides tests of functional pathways linking experimentally manipulated threat, regional fMRI activity, and physiological output, both across time (within person) and across individuals (between persons). It thus integrates time series connectivity and individual difference analyses in the same path model. The results provide evidence for two dissociable, inversely coupled sub-regions of MPFC that independently mediated HR responses. SET caused activity increases in a more dorsal pregenual cingulate region, whose activity was coupled with HR increases. Conversely, SET caused activity decreases in a right ventromedial/medial orbital region, which were coupled with HR increases. Individual differences in coupling strength in each pathway independently predicted individual differences in HR reactivity. These results underscore both the importance and heterogeneity of MPFC in generating physiological responses to threat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19465137,Y,Tor's study,uns,,

PURPOSE: To determine whether exercise-induced decreases in IC rCBF are associated with BP changes throughout PEH. METHODS: Ten subjects were studied on three different days using a counterbalanced design with a randomized order for conditions; all were tested during a resting baseline and then at two of three time points postexercise: 10, 30, and 60 min. Data were collected for HR, mean BP, and rCBF using single-photon emission computed tomography as an index of brain activation. RESULTS: Using ANOVA across conditions, there were differences (P < 0.05; mean +/- SD) for HR from baseline at minute 10 (+15 +/- 4 bpm) and minute 30 (+6 +/- 3 bpm) and for mean BP at minute 10 (-11 +/- 4 mm Hg) and minute 30 (-5 +/- 3 mm Hg). There were significant decreases (P < 0.05) in rCBF at both minutes 10 and 30 after exercise in the inferior thalamus and the right inferior IC regions. Although there were no decreases in BP or IC activity at minute 60, changes in right inferior posterior IC activity and BP were strongly correlated (r2 = 0.74; P < 0.05) postexercise.

These studies might be limited by the indistinguishable neuronal activity due to cognitive processes, which are known to influence autonomic function, and the 'baseline' activity in the central autonomic network. We therefore investigated 26 healthy volunteers in the magnetic resonance scanner to simultaneously obtain functional brain images and RR intervals (intervals between ventricular depolarizations) of the high-resolution electrocardiogram. The mean RR interval length within each functional scan was computed, which was finally convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function to obtain a regressor for the functional time series. The resulting individual contrast image indicated a positive covariation of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal and RR interval length in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Furthermore, a reduced mean cross-approximate entropy value was shown for the interaction between the vmPFC and individual RR intervals. This suggests reduced asynchrony between the heart rate and vmPFC activity in contrast to other brain areas. Our findings confirm data obtained in animals describing the vmPFC as an important forebrain structure of the central autonomic network and an influence of the vmPFC in the cortical generation of efferent vagal activity. This finding needs to be investigated in diseases with known suppression of efferent vagal modulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20128855,Y,corr,uns,,

Although many neuroimaging studies focussed on the neural response to conditioned stimuli, much less is known about the neural response to natural affective stimuli in this pathological population. Previous research has demonstrated an altered emotional experience and autonomic response to emotional stimuli using the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) in drug abusers. Here we aimed, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to study the alterations in the neural responsitivity to pleasant (erotic), unpleasant and neutral IAPS stimuli in cocaine addiction. Thirty-two cocaine-dependent subjects and 26 matched controls completed an fMRI session during the presentation of a set of IAPS pictures as background, while performing a letter discrimination task. Consistent with previous studies, emotional pictures activated an emotional network including amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and occipito-temporal areas in both groups. However, compared with controls, the cocaine group showed a significant hypoactivation of the dorsal and ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens), thalamus, parietal cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) when processing pleasant pictures. The analysis of pleasant versus unpleasant stimuli suggested that between-group differences in the dmPFC and striatal activation may be attributed to arousal processing rather than valence. These results could reflect the neural basis for the reduced ability of cocaine-dependent subjects to experience pleasure by daily natural reinforcers, suggesting that these alterations in the emotion processing may play an important role in drug dependence, treatment and relapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579005,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2009 Nov 14.","Using fMRI, Menon and Levitin [9] clearly found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Importantly, responses in the NAc and VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Listing to pleasant music induced a strong response and significant activation of the VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. Blum et al. [10] provided the first evidence that the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) Taq 1 A1 allele significantly associated with severe alcoholism whereby the author's suggested that they found the first ""reward gene"" located in the mesolimbic system. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences. However, little is known about why some people have a more or less powerful mesolimbic experience when they are listening to music. It is well-known that music may induce an endorphinergic response that is blocked by naloxone, a known opioid antagonist (Goldstein [19]). Opioid transmission in the NAc is associated with dopamine release in the VTA. Moreover, dopamine release in the VTA is linked to polymorphisms of the DRD2 gene and even attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whereby carriers of the DRD2 A1 allele show a reduced NAc release of dopamine (DA). Thus it is conjectured that similar mechanisms in terms of adequate dopamine release and subsequent activation of reward circuitry by listening to music might also be affected by an individual's D2 density in the VTA mediated interaction of the NAc. It is therefore hypothesized that carriers of DRD2 A1 allele may respond significantly differently to carriers of the DRD2 A2 genotype. In this regard, carriers of the D2 A1 allele have a blunted response to glucose and monetary rewards. In contrast powerful D2 agonists like bromocryptine show a heightened activation of the reward circuitry only in DRD2 A1 allele carriers. If music causes a powerful activation in spite of the DRD2 A1 allele due to a strong DA neuronal release which subsequently impinges on existing D2 receptors, then it is reasonable to assume that music is a strong indirect D2 agonist (by virtue of DA neuronal release in the NAc) and may have important therapeutic applicability in Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) related behaviors including Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Ross et al. [18] found that music therapy appears to be a novel motivational tool in a severely impaired inpatient sample of patients with co-occurring mental illness and addiction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19914781,N,no phys of interest,,,

Because there is continuing uncertainty as to whether proximal cerebral artery vasospasm is the only cause of DIND, other processes should be considered. A potential candidate is cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced hypoxia. We hypothesized that recurrent CSDs influence cortical oxygen availability. METHODS: Centers in the Cooperative Study of Brain Injury Depolarizations (COSBID) recruited 9 patients with severe SAH, who underwent open neurosurgery. We used simultaneous, colocalized recordings of electrocorticography and tissue oxygen pressure (p(ti)O(2)) in human cerebral cortex. We screened for delayed cortical infarcts by using sequential brain imaging and investigated cerebral vasospasm by angiography or time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: In a total recording time of 850 hours, 120 CSDs were found in 8 of 9 patients. Fifty-five CSDs ( approximately 46%) were found in only 2 of 9 patients, who later developed DIND. Eighty-nine ( approximately 75%) of all CSDs occurred between the 5th and 7th day after SAH, and 96 (80%) arose within temporal clusters of recurrent CSD. Clusters of CSD occurred simultaneously, with mainly biphasic CSD-associated p(ti)O(2) responses comprising a primary hypoxic and a secondary hyperoxic phase. The frequency of CSD correlated positively with the duration of the hypoxic phase and negatively with that of the hyperoxic phase. Hypoxic phases significantly increased stepwise within CSD clusters; particularly in DIND patients, biphasic p(ti)O(2) responses changed to monophasic p(ti)O(2) decreases within these clusters. Monophasic hypoxic p(ti)O(2) responses to CSD were found predominantly in DIND patients. INTERPRETATION: We attribute these clinical p(ti)O(2) findings mainly to changes in local blood flow in the cortical microcirculation but also to augmented metabolism. Besides classical contributors like proximal cerebral vasospasm, CSD clusters may reduce O(2) supply and increase O(2) consumption, and thereby promote DIND.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20437558,N,clinical,,,

In order to test the relationship between the rapidly fluctuating EEG-defined microstates and the slowly oscillating fMRI-defined resting states, we recorded 64-channel EEG in the scanner while subjects were at rest with their eyes closed. Conventional EEG-microstate analysis determined the typical four EEG topographies that dominated across all subjects. The convolution of the time course of these maps with the hemodynamic response function allowed to fit a linear model to the fMRI BOLD responses and revealed four distinct distributed networks. These networks were spatially correlated with four of the resting-state networks (RSNs) that were found by the conventional fMRI group-level independent component analysis (ICA). These RSNs have previously been attributed to phonological processing, visual imagery, attention reorientation, and subjective interoceptive-autonomic processing. We found no EEG-correlate of the default mode network. Thus, the four typical microstates of the spontaneous EEG seem to represent the neurophysiological correlate of four of the RSNs and show that they are fluctuating much more rapidly than fMRI alone suggests.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188188,N,no phys of interest,,,

Further, recent work has suggested that men and women may differ in these mechanisms of neural control of emotion regulation. Here, we examined the role of the human mPFC in self-report, ANS, and HPA stress reactivity by testing a group of participants with damage to this region (9 women and 9 men), a brain damaged comparison group (6 women and 6 men), and healthy comparison participants (27 women and 27 men) on an orthostatic challenge and the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). The mPFC participants showed heightened self-reported stress in response to the TSST. In women, mPFC damage led to an increased cortisol response to the TSST.

Finally, men with mPFC damage showed altered autonomic control of the heart (higher heart rate and lower high frequency heart rate variability) during an orthostatic challenge.

We assessed the brain circuitry underlying personal script-driven irritability in healthy subjects (n = 11) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. METHOD: Blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes were recorded during auditory presentation of personal scripts of irritability in contrast to scripts of happiness or neutral emotional content. Self-rated emotional measurements and skin conductance recordings were also obtained. Images were acquired using a 1,5T magnetic resonance scanner. Brain activation maps were constructed from individual images, and between-condition differences in the mean power of experimental response were identified by using cluster-wise nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Compared to neutral scripts, increased blood oxygen level-dependent signal during irritability scripts was detected in the left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and in the left medial, anterolateral and posterolateral dorsal prefrontal cortex (cluster-wise p-value < 0.05). While the involvement of the subgenual cingulate and dorsal anterolateral prefrontal cortices was unique to the irritability state, increased blood oxygen level-dependent signal in dorsomedial and dorsal posterolateral prefrontal regions were also present during happiness induction. CONCLUSION: Irritability induction is associated with functional changes in a limited set of brain regions previously implicated in the mediation of emotional states.

Epub 2009 Dec 2.","The aim of the present paper is to assess the effects of altered dopamine (DA) transmission on the functional connectivity among brain regions mediating aversive conditioning in humans. To this aim, we analyzed a previous published data set from a double-blind design combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in which healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three drug groups: amphetamine (an indirect DA agonist), haloperidol (DA D2 receptor antagonist), and placebo. Participants were exposed to an aversive classical conditioning paradigm using cutaneous electrical stimulation as the unconditioned stimulus (US), and visual cues as the conditioned stimuli (CS) where one colour (CS+) was followed by the US in 33% of the trials and another colour (CS-) had no consequences. All participants reported awareness of stimulus contingencies. Group analysis of fMRI data revealed that the left ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala activated in response to the CS+ in all the three groups. Because of their activation patterns and documented involvement in aversive conditioning, both regions were used as seeds in the functional connectivity analysis. To constrain the functional networks obtained to relate to the conditioned response, we also correlated seed activity with the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). In the placebo group, the right ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN), bilateral caudate, right parahippocampal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral middle frontal (BA 46), orbitofrontal, and ventromedial prefrontal cortices (PFC, BA 10/11) correlated with the VS and amygdala seeds in response to the CS+ compared to the CS-. Enhancing dopamine transmission via amphetamine was associated with reduced task differences and significant functional connectivity for both CS+ and CS- conditions between the left VS seed and regions modulated by DA, such as the left VTA/SN, right caudate, left amygdala, left middle frontal gyrus (BA 46), and bilateral ventromedial PFC (BA 10). Blocking dopamine transmission via haloperidol was associated with significant functional connectivity across an alternate network of regions including the left amygdala seed and the right insula, the left ACC (BA 24/32), bilateral IPL (BA 40), precuneus (BA 7), post-central gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (BA 46), and supplementary motor area (SMA, BA 6) to the CS+ versus the CS-.

Epub 2009 Aug 2.","OBJECTIVE: To address the role of anxiety and depression symptoms in altered pain processing in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). DESIGN: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to rectal distensions delivered at previously determined individual discomfort thresholds was assessed. PATIENTS: 15 female patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and with normal rectal pain thresholds, and 12 healthy women. MEASURES: The correlation of anxiety and depression symptoms, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), with subjective pain ratings and the BOLD response during distension-induced brain activation were analysed within IBS. Group differences in pain-induced brain activation with and without controlling for HADS scores were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients with IBS experienced significantly more pain and discomfort upon rectal distensions in the scanner, despite unaltered rectal sensory thresholds. Anxiety and depression scores were associated with these subjective stimulus ratings, but not with rectal sensory thresholds. Anxiety symptoms in IBS were significantly associated with pain-induced activation of the anterior midcingulate cortex and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Depression scores correlated with activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellar areas within IBS. Group comparisons with the two-sample t test revealed significant activation in the IBS versus controls contrast in the anterior insular cortex and PFC. Inclusion of anxiety and depression scores, respectively, as confounding variables led to a loss of significant group differences. CONCLUSIONS: Altered central processing of visceral stimuli in IBS is at least in part mediated by symptoms of anxiety and depression, which may modulate the affective-motivational aspects of the pain response.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19651629,N,no phys of interest,,,

This reaction can also turn into maladaptation, associated with a wide spectrum of stress-related diseases. Up to now, the cortical mechanisms of sympathetic activation in acute mental stress have not been sufficiently characterized. We therefore investigated cerebral activation applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of a mental stress task with graded levels of difficulty, i.e. four versions of a Stroop task (Colour Word Interference Test, CWT) in healthy subjects. To analyze stress-associated sympathetic activation, skin conductance and heart rate were continuously recorded. The results show that sympathetic activation through mental stress is associated with distinct cerebral regions being immediately involved in task performance (visual, motor, and premotor areas). Other activated regions (right insula, dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, cerebellar regions) are unrelated to task performance. These latter regions have previously been considered to be involved in mediating different stress responses. The results might furthermore serve as a basis for future investigations of the connection between these cortical regions in the generation of stress-related diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20004250,Y,corr,rand,,

In contrast to the brainstem, the role of the cortex has not been clearly evaluated. This study was therefore designed to address cerebral function during a whole thermoregulatory cycle (cold, neutral and warm stimulation) using 18-fluordeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET). Sympathetic activation parameters were co-registered. Ten healthy male volunteers were examined three times on three different days in a water-perfused whole-body suit. After a baseline period (32 degrees C), temperature was either decreased to 7 degrees C (cold), increased to 50 degrees C (warm) or kept constant (32 degrees C, neutral), thereafter the PET examination was performed. Cerebral glucose metabolism was increased in infrapontine brainstem and cerebellar hemispheres during cooling and warming, each compared with neutral temperature. Simultaneously, FDG uptake decreased in the bilateral anterior/mid-cingulate cortex during warming, and in the right insula during cooling and warming. Conjunction analyses revealed that right insular deactivation and brainstem activation appeared both during cold and warm stimulation. Metabolic connectivity analyses revealed positive correlations between the cortical activations, and negative correlations between these cortical areas and brainstem/cerebellar regions. Heart rate changes negatively correlated with glucose metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex and in the middle frontal gyrus/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and changes of sweating with glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex. In summary, these results suggest that the cerebral cortex exerts an inhibitory control on autonomic centres located in the brainstem or cerebellum.

We postulated that cerebral activation patterns could represent different perceptions of high-calorie images during hunger and satiety and could be determined by patients' subjective ratings. METHODS: After 6 h of starvation and also in a state of satiety, 12 female patients with AN and 12 normal-weight women were assessed by use of fMRI with high-calorie food images. All patients suffered from a restrictive type of AN. Heart rates, subjective ratings of satiety and valences of the visual stimuli were assessed. RESULTS: Food stimuli presented during a state of hunger were associated with significant activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and insula in the control group and of the prefrontal and central cortices and insula in the AN group. During the hunger state activation in AN of the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex was revealed compared to the controls. In the state of satiety, activation of the left insula was observed in the AN group. Use of the food valence judgment as a covariate confirmed the insula activation and revealed additional activation of the orbitofrontal, cingulate and medial temporal cortices.

This observational study assessed whether in PD anosmia and autonomic failure are related to each other or to neuroimaging evidence of striatal dopamine deficiency. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in 23 patients with sporadic PD. Baroreflex-cardiovagal gain was quantified from the relationship between cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and baroreflex-sympathoneural function by responses of systolic pressure to the Valsalva maneuver and of hemodynamics and plasma norepinephrine (NE) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) levels to orthostasis. 6-[(18)F]Fluorodopamine PET and plasma and skeletal muscle microdialysate NE and DHPG were used to indicate cardiac and extracardiac noradrenergic innervation and brain 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa PET to indicate striatal dopaminergic innervation. Parkinsonism was assessed by UPDRS scores. RESULTS: Compared to patients with PD and normal to moderately decreased sense of smell, patients with anosmic PD had lower mean baroreflex-cardiovagal gain (p = 0.04), larger falls in systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and orthostasis (p = 0.04, p = 0.02), smaller orthostatic increments in plasma NE and DHPG (p = 0.003, p = 0.03), lower cardiac septal:hepatic and renal cortical:hepatic ratios of 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity (p = 0.01, p = 0.06), and lower microdialysate NE and DHPG (p = 0.01; p = 0.006).

Here we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging and multiorgan physiological recording to dissect experience of two distinct disgust forms and their relationship to peripheral and central physiological activity. We show that experience of core and body-boundary-violation disgust are dissociable in both peripheral autonomic and central neural responses and also that emotional experience specific to anterior insular activity encodes these different underlying patterns of peripheral physiological responses.

Previous studies using fMRI and human subjects have reported that the amygdala plays a role in this phenomenon. However, the noxious stimuli that were used as unconditioned stimuli in previous studies (e.g., electric shock) might have been ecologically invalid because we seldom encounter such stimuli in daily life. Therefore, we investigated whether a face stimulus could be conditioned by using a voice that had negative emotional valence and was collected from a real-life environment. A skin conductance response showed that healthy subjects were conditioned by using these stimuli. In an fMRI study, there was greater amygdala activation in response to the faces that had been paired with the voice than to those that had not. The right amygdala showed transient activity in the early stage of acquisition. A psychophysiological interaction analysis indicated that the subcortical pathway from the medial geniculate body to the amygdala played a role in conditioning. Modulation of the subcortical pathway by voice stimuli preceded the transient activity in the amygdala.

METHODS: A voxel-based examination of the whole brain was conducted among 43 hypertensive patients treated for 1 year with assessment pre and post treatment, using positron emission tomography and neuropsychological testing. RESULTS: Neuropsychological performance improved over the year of treatment but was unrelated to change in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Neither mean resting rCBF nor responsivity to a working memory task changed significantly with treatment. However, patients with greater lowering of systolic BP during treatment showed increased rCBF responsivity to a working memory task in medial and orbital frontal areas and decreased rCBF responsivity in mid frontal, parietal, thalamus, and pons (as well as lower thalamic rCBF pretreatment). Improved working memory performance over the treatment period was related to decreased responsivity in medial frontal, medullary, and parietal areas. Patients showing greater lowering of BP with treatment seemed to reduce excitatory and enhance inhibitory coupling between memory processing and BP more than those with less treatment success.

Remarkably, inhibition of the aPFC by cathodal tDCS did not lead to an impairment of deceptive behavior but rather to a significant improvement. This effect manifested in faster reaction times in telling lies, but not in telling the truth, a decrease in sympathetic skin-conductance response and feelings of guilt while deceiving the interrogator and a significantly higher lying quotient reflecting skillful lying. Increasing the excitability of the aPFC by anodal tDCS did not affect deceptive behavior, confirming the specificity of the stimulation polarity.

METHODS: In this case-control study, 10 patients with CRPS and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects underwent a PET scan using the subtype-nonselective opioidergic radioligand [(18)F]fluoroethyl-diprenorphine. As a surrogate for regional cerebral opioid receptor availability, the opioid receptor binding potential (OR-BP) was assessed by means of the modified Logan plot with reference region input for categorical group comparison and correlation with clinical data in the patient group. RESULTS: Patients with CRPS showed reduced OR-BP in contralateral amygdala and parahippocampal gyri and increased OR-BP in contralateral prefrontal cortical areas. When OR-BP in the midcingulate cortex and the ipsilateral temporal cortex was low, the McGill pain rating index was high. In general, when anxiety and depression scales were high, contralateral temporal OR-BP was high as well. In addition, the anxiety scale decreased with increasing OR-BP in the contralateral parahippocampal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate altered central opioidergic neurotransmission in CRPS. The correlation of regional opioid receptor availability to measures of pain, anxiety, and depression underlines the clinical importance of these findings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625165,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, learning-related changes in the unconditioned response (UCR) produced by a predictable UCS can also develop. Learning-related reductions in UCR magnitude are often referred to as UCR diminution. In the present study, we examined UCR diminution in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal by pairing supra- and sub-threshold CS presentations with a UCS. UCR diminution was observed within several brain regions associated with fear learning and memory including the insula, inferior parietal lobe, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC, and dorsolateral PFC. CS perception appeared to mediate UCR diminution within the ventromedial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex. UCRs within these regions were larger when the UCS followed an unperceived compared to a perceived CS. UCS expectancies appeared to modulate UCRs within the dorsomedial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, insula, and inferior parietal lobe. Activity within these regions showed an inverse relationship with participants' UCS expectancies, such that as UCS expectancy increased UCR magnitude decreased. In addition, activity within the dorsomedial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and insula showed a linear relationship with unconditioned skin conductance response (SCR) expression. These findings demonstrate UCR diminution within the fMRI signal, and suggest that UCS expectancies modulate prefrontal cortex responses to aversive stimuli. In turn, prefrontal cortex activity appears to modulate the expression of unconditioned SCRs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19616105,Y,corr,uns,,

Therefore, normalization of fMRI signals with these parameters is useful in reducing variations and improving sensitivity of this important technique. Recently, we have shown that basal venous oxygenation is a significant modulator of fMRI signals and individuals with higher venous oxygenation tend to have lower fMRI signals. In this study, we aim to test the utility of venous oxygenation normalization in distinguishing subject groups. A ""model"" condition was used in which two visual stimuli with different flashing frequencies were used to stimulate two subject groups, respectively, thereby simulating the situation of control and patient groups. It was found that visual-evoked BOLD signal is significantly correlated with baseline venous T2 (P = 0.0003) and inclusion of physiologic modulator in the regression analysis can substantially reduce P values of group-level statistical tests. When applied to voxel-wise analysis, the normalization process can allow the detection of more significant voxels. The utility of other basal parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygenation, and end-tidal CO(2), in BOLD normalization was also assessed and it was found that the improvement was less significant.

Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in signal intensity were measured over 4 s every 8 s (200) volumes; MSNA was recorded during the previous 4 s epoch, which takes into account peripheral conduction delays along unmyelinated axons and neurovascular coupling delays. Analysis of temporal coupling between BOLD signal intensity and nerve signal intensity revealed sites in which the two signals covaried, but only in the medulla. Because scans were conducted in a caudorostral direction, we could constrain the analysis to the medulla by only examining the first 1 s of the fMRI and nerve signals. Increases in MSNA were associated with robust bilateral increases in signal intensity in the dorsolateral region of the medulla that corresponds to the human equivalent of the rostal ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Reciprocal decreases in signal intensity occurred in the regions of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). Group analysis also revealed increases in signal intensity in the caudal pressor area (CPA), medullary raphe (MR), and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX).

Ten gastroparetic patients refractory to standard medical therapy participated in this study and data were collected at baseline, within two weeks before surgery for implantation of GES system, and at follow-up sessions between 6 and 12 weeks after GES therapy was initiated. In each session, electrocardiogram, electrogastrogram (EGG) and gastric barostat measurements were conducted before and after a caloric liquid meal. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain scans were performed on a separate day. During GES therapy there was a significant increase in the discomfort threshold for mean pressure from 21 mmHg at baseline to 25 mmHg at follow-up, and for mean volume from 561 mL to 713 mL. A significant increase in the postprandial EGG power (amplitude) was observed between baseline and follow up. The sympathovagal balance was significantly decreased after GES therapy, indicating a significant increase in vagal activity. The cumulative PET data showed an increase in quantitative radioactive counts relative to the standardized data base in both the thalamic and caudate nuclei after chronic GES therapy. We conclude that our data suggest that the symptomatic improvement achieved by GES in gastroparesis is best explained by activation of vagal afferent pathways to influence CNS control mechanisms for nausea and vomiting accompanied by enhanced vagal efferent autonomic function and decreased gastric sensitivity to volume distention which enhances postprandial gastric accommodation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19719511,N,clinical,,,

In a previous human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we observed acute effects of the stress hormone cortisol on prefrontal structures. Men showed evidence for impaired fear conditioning after cortisol treatment, while the opposite pattern was found for women. In the current experiment, we tested whether similar sex-dependent effects would occur on the neural level if contingency awareness was prevented experimentally to investigate implicit learning processes. A differential fear conditioning experiment with transcutaneous electrical stimulation as unconditioned stimulus and geometric figures as conditioned stimuli (CS) was conducted. One figure was always paired (CS+), whereas the other (CS-) was never paired with the UCS. Thirty-nine (19 female) subjects participated in this fMRI study, receiving either placebo or 30 mg cortisol (hydrocortisone) before conditioning. Dependent variables were skin conductance responses (SCRs) and neural activity (BOLD signal). In line with prior findings in unaware participants, no differential learning could be observed for the SCRs. However, a sex x cortisol interaction was detected with a reduced mean response to the CS after cortisol treatment in men, while the opposite pattern was observed in women (enhanced mean SCR under cortisol). In the contrast CS+ minus CS-, neural activity showed a sex x cortisol interaction in the insula and further trends in the hippocampus and the thalamus. In these regions, cortisol reduced the CS+/CS- differentiation in men but enhanced it in women. In contrast to these sex specific effects, differential amygdala activation was found in the placebo group but not in the cortisol group, irrespective of sex. Further, differential neural activity in the amygdala and thalamus were positively correlated with the SCRs in the placebo group only. The present study in contingency unaware participants illustrates that cortisol has in some brain regions sex specific effects on neural correlates of emotional learning. These effects might translate into a different vulnerability of the two sexes for anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19683399,Y,corr in placebo,rand,,

Indeed, the perceptual inputs issuing from a live theatrical performance are intended to represent something else, and the actions, emphasized by the writing and staging, are the key prompting the adhesion of viewers to fiction, i.e., their belief that it is real. This phenomenon raises the issue of the cognitive processes governing access to a fictional reality during live theater and of their cerebral underpinnings. To get insight into the physiological substrates of adhesion we recreated the peculiar context of watching live drama in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, with simultaneous recording of heart activity. The instants of adhesion were defined as the co-occurrence of theatrical events determined a priori by the stage director and the spectators' offline reports of moments when fiction acted as reality. These data served to specify, for each spectator, individual fMRI time-series, used in a random-effect group analysis to define the pattern of brain response to theatrical events. The changes in this pattern related to subjects' adhesion to fiction, were investigated using a region of interest analysis. The results showed that adhesion to theatrical events correlated with increased activity in the left BA47 and posterior superior temporal sulcus, together with a decrease in dynamic heart rate variability, leading us to discuss the hypothesis of subtle changes in the subjects' state of awareness, enabling them to mentally dissociate physical and mental (drama-viewing) experiences, to account for the phenomenon of adhesion to dramatic fiction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20838472,N,no corr,,,

A total of N=32 healthy subjects have been investigated. Subjects received painful laser stimulation of the left hand. The fMRI BOLD response was measured simultaneously with continuous EDA recordings. Single trial EDA responses to laser stimulation habituated over time with substantial subject-to-subject differences in the degree and speed of habituation. fMRI BOLD habituation was assessed by contrasting the first half of the experiment against the second half and was found in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We hypothesized that single trial EDA habituation would reflect BOLD habituation which was investigated separately in subjects with 'faster' (N=15) and 'slower' (N=14) EDA habituation. Significant habituation of the BOLD signal was only found in subjects with 'faster' EDA habituation that was accompanied by a signal increase in the rostral ACC and the periaqueductal grey. Furthermore, subjects with faster EDA habituation provided lower pain ratings. Therefore the EDA habituation profile to painful stimulation may constitute a pain-related (endo)phenotype and may be an informative additional endpoint measure in fMR-imaging of pain, especially when people suffering from chronic pain states in which pain processing is often altered are studied.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833154,M,coordss?,,,

Some characteristics, for example, syncope, may stem from delayed sympathetic outflow to the vasculature; other symptoms, including profuse sweating, may derive from overall enhanced sympathetic output. The dysregulation suggests significant alterations to autonomic regulatory brain areas. Murine models of the genetic mutations present in the human CCHS condition indicate brainstem autonomic nuclei are targeted; however, the broad range of symptoms suggests more widespread alterations. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess neural response patterns to the Valsalva maneuver, an autonomic challenge eliciting a sequence of sympathetic and parasympathetic actions, in nine CCHS and 25 control subjects. CCHS patients showed diminished and time-lagged heart rate responses to the Valsalva maneuver, and muted fMRI signal responses across multiple brain areas. During the positive pressure phase of the Valsalva maneuver, CCHS responses were muted, but were less so in recovery phases. In rostral structures, including the amygdala and hippocampus, the normal declining patterns were replaced by increasing trends or more modest declines. Earlier onset responses appeared in the hypothalamus, midbrain, raphe pallidus, and left rostral ventrolateral medulla. Phase-lagged responses appeared in cerebellar pyramis and anterior cingulate cortex. The time-distorted and muted central responses to autonomic challenges likely underlie the exaggerated sympathetic action and autonomic dyscontrol in CCHS, impairing cerebral autoregulation, possibly exacerbating neural injury, and enhancing the potential for cardiac arrhythmia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211704,N,no corr,,,

We manipulated the uncertainty of outcomes in the task; specifically, we compared a condition with high predictability of reward/punishment (contingent-reward condition) and a condition with low predictability of reward/punishment (random-reward condition). The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was commonly activated in both conditions. Compared with the contingent-reward condition, the orbitofrontal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and dorsal striatum were activated in the random-reward condition, where subjects had to continue to seek contingency between stimuli and reward/punishment. Activation of these brain regions correlated with a positive component of ERPs locked to feedback signals (feedback-related positivity), which showed an association with behavioral decision-making in the contingent-reward condition. Furthermore, cardiovascular responses were attenuated in the random-reward condition, where continuous attention and contingency monitoring were needed, and such attenuation of cardiovascular responses was mediated by vagal activity that was governed by the rostral ACC.

The aims of this study were to investigate cortical reorganisation in patients with pain caused by chronic pancreatitis (CP) and to correlate putative cortical reorganisation to clinical pain scores.

The sigmoid was stimulated electrically with simultaneous recording of evoked brain potentials (EPs). The brain source localisations reflecting direct neuronal activity were fitted by a five-dipole model projected to magnetic resonance imaging of the individual brains. RESULTS: Patients showed prolonged latencies of the EPs confined to the frontal region of the brain (p < 0.01). The corresponding brain sources were located in the bilateral insula, cingulate gyrus and bilateral secondary somatosensory area. The insular dipoles were localised more posterior in the patients than in healthy subjects (p < 0.01). The shift in insular dipole localisation was negatively correlated with the patients' clinical pain scores (p < 0.05).

Twenty-eight healthy women were tested in a crossover design with menstrual cycle phase (late luteal versus late follicular) and stress (stress induction versus control) as within-subject factors. After stress induction (or control), we probed neural responses to facial expressions using fMRI. During the late luteal phase, negative affect was highest and the stress-induced increase in heart rate was mildly augmented. fMRI data of the control condition replicate previous findings of elevated amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex responses when comparing the late luteal with the late follicular phase. Importantly, stress induction had opposite effects in the two cycle phases, with unexpected lower response magnitudes in the late luteal phase. Moreover, the larger the increase in allopregnanolone concentration across the menstrual cycle was, the smaller the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex responses were after stress induction in the late luteal phase. Our findings show that moderate psychological stress influences menstrual cycle effects on activity in the emotion regulation circuitry.

However, many important links are still missing in our understanding of brain activity in relation to the regulation of pain-related physiological responses. This fMRI study investigates the cerebral correlates of pain (rating), motor responses (RIII-reflex) and autonomic activity (skin conductance response; SCR) evoked by noxious electrical stimulation. Stimulus intensity was adjusted individually based on the RIII threshold to control for differences in peripheral processes and baseline spinal activation. Covariance analyses were used to reveal individual differences in brain activity uniquely associated with individual differences in pain, RIII and SCR. Shock-evoked activity in cingulate, medial orbitofrontal and parahippocampal regions predicted pain sensitivity. Moreover, lateral orbitofrontal and cingulate areas showed strong positive associations with individual differences in motor reactivity but negative associations with autonomic reactivity. Notably, individual differences in OFC activation was almost fully accounted by the combination of individual measures of autonomic and motor reactivity (R(2)=0.93). Additionally, trial-to-trial fluctuations of RIII-reflex and SCR (within-subjects) were proportional to shock-evoked responses in subgenual cingulate cortex (RIII), anterior insula (SCR) and midcingulate cortex (SCR and RIII). Together, these results confirm that individual differences in perceptual, motor, and autonomic components of pain reflect robust individual differences in brain activity. Furthermore, the brain correlates of trial-to-trial fluctuations in pain responses provide additional evidence for a partial segregation of sub-systems involved more specifically in the ongoing monitoring, and possibly the regulation, of pain-related motor and autonomic responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20417032,Y,corr,rand,,

In both cases, the scans demonstrated reduced fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in the cerebral cortex, with the temporal regions being most affected. PET imaging was more sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging in these patients. In contrast, the one previous report of acute NMDA receptor encephalitis indicated cortical hypermetabolism.

Most functional neuroimaging studies to date examined the effect of modafinil only on information processing underlying executive cognition, but cognitive enhancers in general have been shown to have pronounced effects on emotional behavior, too. We examined the effect of modafinil on neural circuits underlying affective processing and cognitive functions. Healthy volunteers were enrolled in this double-blinded placebo-controlled trial (100 mg/day for 7 days). They underwent BOLD fMRI while performing an emotion information-processing task that activates the amygdala and two prefrontally dependent cognitive tasks-a working memory (WM) task and a variable attentional control (VAC) task. A clinical assessment that included measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the profile of mood state (POMS) questionnaire was also performed on each test day. BOLD fMRI revealed significantly decreased amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli on modafinil compared with the placebo condition. During executive cognition tasks, a WM task and a VAC task, modafinil reduced BOLD signal in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate. Although not statistically significant, there were trends for reduced anxiety, for decreased fatigue-inertia and increased vigor-activity, as well as decreased anger-hostility on modafinil. Modafinil in low doses has a unique physiologic profile compared with stimulant drugs: it enhances the efficiency of prefrontal cortical cognitive information processing, while dampening reactivity to threatening stimuli in the amygdala, a brain region implicated in anxiety.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20555311,N,no phys of interest,,,

We measured behavioral, autonomic and neural correlates of the paradigm in healthy subjects, applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and measurement of skin conductance. Therefore, neutral visual stimuli were paired with an unpleasant white noise as unconditioned stimulus. Twenty healthy subjects performed three experimental phases of learning: familiarization, acquisition and extinction. Subjective ratings of valence and arousal after each phase of conditioning as well as skin conductance measurement indicated successful conditioning. During acquisition, fMRI results showed increased activation for the conditioned stimulus (CS+(unpaired)) when compared with the non-conditioned stimulus (CS-) in the right amygdala, the insulae, the anterior cingulate cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus, all regions known to be involved in emotional processing. In addition, a linearly decreasing activation in the right amygdala/hippocampus for the CS- across the acquisition phase was found. There were no significant differences between CS+ and CS- during extinction.

To identify the cortical and subcortical sites involved, and to differentiate between central command and reflex inputs, we used blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) of the whole brain (3 T). Subjects performed submaximal static handgrip exercise for 2 min followed by 6 min of PEI; MSNA was recorded on a separate day. During the contraction phase, parallel increases in BOLD signal intensity occurred in the contralateral primary motor cortex and cerebellar nuclei and cortex; these matched the effort profile and ceased at the conclusion of the contraction. Progressive increases in the contralateral insula and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, with progressive decreases in the perigenual anterior cingulate and midcingulate cortices, were sustained during the period of PEI and thus did not depend on central command. Discrete bilateral activation of the medial and lateral dorsal medulla was also observed during the contraction and PEI; we believe that these represent the nucleus tracts solitarius (NTS) and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), respectively. Given that metaboreceptor afferents are known to project to the NTS and that the RVLM is the primary output nucleus for MSNA, our data support that the metaboreflex is mediated by the medulla, whereas the somatosensory, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices are involved in the sensory and affective components of the maneuver.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20185626,N,no corr,,,

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the use of positive or negative reinforcement in horse training may have consequences on the animals' perception of humans, as a positive, negative or neutral element. Two groups of ponies were trained to walk backwards in response to a vocal order using either positive or negative reinforcement. Heart rate monitors and behavioural observations were used to assess the animals' perception of humans on the short (just after training) and long (5 months later) terms. The results showed that the type of reinforcement had a major effect on the subsequent animals' perception of familiar and unfamiliar humans. Negative reinforcement was rapidly associated with an increased emotional state, as revealed by heart rate measurements and behavioural observations (head movements and ears laid back position). Its use led the ponies to seek less contact with humans. On the contrary, ponies trained with positive reinforcement showed an increased interest in humans and sought contact after training. This is especially remarkable as it was reached in a maximum of 5 sessions of 1 to 3 min (i.e. 5 to 15 min) and had lasting effects (visible after 5 months). Even learning was positively influenced by positive reinforcement.

Epub 2010 May 6.","BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of fluorine-19 allows for the mapping of oxygen partial pressure within perfluorocarbons in the alveolar space (Pao(2)). Theoretically, fMRI-detected Pao(2) can be combined with the Fick principle approach, i.e., a mass balance of oxygen uptake by ventilation and delivery by perfusion, to quantify the ventilation-perfusion ratio (Va/Q) of a lung region: The mixed venous blood and the inspiratory oxygen fraction, which are equal for all lung regions, are measured. In addition, the local expiratory oxygen fraction and the end capillary oxygen content, both of which may differ between the lung regions, are calculated using the fMRI-detected Pao(2). We investigated this approach by numerical simulations and applied it to quantify local Va/Q in the perfluorocarbons during partial liquid ventilation. METHODS: Numerical simulations were performed to analyze the sensitivity of the Va/Q calculation and to compare this approach with another one proposed by Rizi et al. in 2004 (Magn Reson Med 2004;52:65-72). Experimentally, the method was used during partial liquid ventilation in 7 anesthetized pigs. The Pao(2) distribution in intraalveolar perflubron was measured by fluorine-19 MRI. Respiratory gas fractions together with arterial and mixed venous blood samples were taken to quantify oxygen partial pressure and content. Using the Fick principle, the local Va/Q was estimated. The impact of gravity (nondependent versus dependent) of perflubron dose (10 vs 20 mL/kg body weight) and of inspired oxygen fraction (Fio(2)) (0.4-1.0) on Va/Q was examined. RESULTS: In numerical simulations, the Fick principle proved to be appropriate over the Va/Q range from 0.02 to 2.5. Va/Q values were in acceptable agreement with the method published by Rizi et al. In the experimental setting, low mean Va/Q values were found in perflubron (confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.29 with 20 mL/kg perflubron). At this dose, Va/Q in the nondependent lung was higher (CI 0.18-0.39) than in the dependent lung regions (CI 0.06-0.16; P = 0.006; Student t test). Differences depending on Fio(2) or perflubron dose were, however, small. CONCLUSION: The results show that derivation of Va/Q from local Po(2) measurements using fMRI in perflubron is feasible. The low detected Va/Q suggests that oxygen transport into the perflubron-filled alveolar space is significantly restrained.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20448078,N,no phys of interest,,,

Understanding the neural correlates of this vascular measure is important in view of emerging evidence linking poorer cognitive performance with increased IMT in individuals without clinical cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: Seventy-three participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (70.9 years; SD, 7.3) were evaluated with carotid artery ultrasound and resting [(15)O]H(2)O positron emission tomography. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and gray and white matter volumes in the regions where IMT is related to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), we found that higher IMT was associated with lower rCBF in lingual, inferior occipital, and superior temporal regions. Higher IMT was also associated with higher rCBF in medial frontal gyrus, putamen, and hippocampal-uncal regions (P=0.001). Whereas women had lower IMT (P=0.01) and mean arterial pressure (P=0.05) than men, they showed more robust associations between IMT and rCBF. The relationship between IMT and rCBF was only minimally affected by additional adjustment for mean arterial pressure. CONCLUSIONS: IMT is related to patterns of resting rCBF in older adults without clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that there are regional differences in CBF that are associated with subclinical vascular disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20044526,N,no phys of interest,,,

A role for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disturbances in this failure to consolidate extinction learning has been proposed. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) measurements in 16 healthy participants during conditioning/extinction and later recall of extinction. The visual stimuli were basic geometric forms and electrical shocks functioned as the unconditioned stimulus. Between the conditioning/extinction and recall sessions, participants received a 90-min sleep window in the sleep laboratory. This daytime sleep was polysomnographically recorded and scored by professionals blind to the study design. Only seven out of 16 participants had REM sleep; participants without REM sleep had a significantly slower decline of both SCR and neural activity of the laterodorsal tegmentum in response to electrical shocks during conditioning. At recall of fear extinction, participants with preceding REM sleep had a reduced SCR and stronger activation of the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex and bilateral lingual gyrus in response to the extinguished stimulus than participants lacking REM sleep. This study indicates that trait-like differences in shock reactivity/habituation (mediated by the brainstem) are predictive of REM sleep disruption, which in turn is associated with impaired consolidation of extinction (mediated by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These findings help understand the neurobiological basis and the temporal sequence of the relationship between shock exposure, disturbed sleep and impaired consolidation of extinction, as observed in PTSD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471033,N,no corr,,,

Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers high temporal and spatial resolution, most studies available were done with radioligand-positron emission tomography, as fMRI requires non-magnetic stimulus equipment and fast on-off conditions. We developed a new approach for painful stimulation of the trigeminal nerve that can be implemented within an event-related design using fMRI and aimed to detect increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals as surrogate markers of trigeminal pain processing. Using an olfactometer, 20 healthy volunteers received intranasally standardized trigeminal nociceptive stimuli (ammonia gas) as well as olfactory (rose odour) and odorless control stimuli (air puffs). Imaging revealed robust BOLD responses to the trigeminal nociceptive stimulation in cortical and subcortical brain areas known to be involved in pain processing. Focusing on the trigeminal pain pathway, significant activations were observed bilaterally in brainstem areas at the trigeminal nerve entry zone, which are agreeable with the principal trigeminal nuclei. Furthermore, increased signal changes could be detected ipsilaterally at anatomical localization of the trigeminal ganglion and bilaterally in the rostral medulla, which probably represents the spinal trigeminal nuclei. However, brainstem areas involved in the endogenous pain control system that are close to this anatomical localization, such as raphe nuclei, have to be discussed. Our findings suggest that mapping trigeminal pain processing using fMRI with this non-invasive experimental design is feasible and capable of evoking specific activations in the trigeminal nociceptive system. This method will provide an ideal opportunity to study the trigeminal pain system in both health and pathological conditions such as idiopathic headache disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19673914,N,no corr,,,

Here, we examine a new method of integrated processing of concurrent NIRS and fMRI data collected on six human subjects during a whole brain resting state acquisition. The method combines the high spatial resolution offered by fMRI (approximately 3mm) and the high temporal resolution offered by NIRS (approximately 80 ms) to allow for the quantitative assessment of temporal relationships between the LFOs observed at different spatial locations in fMRI data. This temporal relationship allowed us to infer that the origin of a large proportion of the LFOs is independent of the baseline neural activity. The spatio-temporal pattern of LFOs detected by NIRS and fMRI evolves temporally through the brain in a way that resembles cerebral blood flow dynamics. Our results suggest that a major component of the LFOs arise from fluctuations in the blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation at a global circulatory system level.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600975,N,no corr,,,

Imaging studies in cocaine abusers show decreases in striatal dopamine levels, which we hypothesize may enhance conditioned responses since tonic dopamine levels modulate phasic dopamine release. To test this we assessed the effects of increasing tonic dopamine levels (using oral methylphenidate) on brain activation induced by cocaine-cues in cocaine abusers. Brain metabolism (marker of brain function) was measured with PET and (18)FDG in 24 active cocaine abusers tested four times; twice watching a Neutral video (nature scenes) and twice watching a Cocaine-cues video; each video was preceded once by placebo and once by methylphenidate (20 mg). The Cocaine-cues video increased craving to the same extent with placebo (68%) and with methylphenidate (64%). In contrast, SPM analysis of metabolic images revealed that differences between Neutral versus Cocaine-cues conditions were greater with placebo than methylphenidate; whereas with placebo the Cocaine-cues decreased metabolism (p<0.005) in left limbic regions (insula, orbitofrontal, accumbens) and right parahippocampus, with methylphenidate it only decreased in auditory and visual regions, which also occurred with placebo. Decreases in metabolism in these regions were not associated with craving; in contrast the voxel-wise SPM analysis identified significant correlations with craving in anterior orbitofrontal cortex (p<0.005), amygdala, striatum and middle insula (p<0.05). This suggests that methylphenidate's attenuation of brain reactivity to Cocaine-cues is distinct from that involved in craving. Cocaine-cues decreased metabolism in limbic regions (reflects activity over 30 minutes), which contrasts with activations reported by fMRI studies (reflects activity over 2-5 minutes) that may reflect long-lasting limbic inhibition following activation.

Associated blood oxygen level- dependent (BOLD) activations were found mainly in the right parietal region. The result represents a different generator of pilomotor seizure compared to prior reports. We suggests that the feeling of gooseflesh could be the core ictal symptom and a direct pathway from the sensory cortex to the lower autonomic system may exist bypassing the classic cerebral autonomic center.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21045505,N,case study,,,

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain mechanisms of SIA in 21 healthy participants. Using a block design series of mildly painful pressure stimuli were applied to the left medial phalanx of the second digit during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mental arithmetic combined with increasing levels of noise was used as a stressor. Verbal ratings, changes in blood pressure and heart rate confirmed the validity of the stress induction. Post-stress pain thresholds and pain tolerance were significantly higher and post-stress pain and unpleasantness ratings were significantly lower compared to pre-stress levels. SIA led to an increase of the blood-level-dependent oxygenation response in the primary somatosensory cortex, bilaterally in the anterior insula, and secondary somatosensory cortex. The increase in pain tolerance correlated significantly with activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and pain unpleasantness with activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. SIA seems to activate similar brain networks as placebo analgesia or analgesia mediated by diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and involved sensory, affective and cognitive modulatory circuits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20817354,N,no corr,,,

Bupropion, a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is recommended as an alternative treatment without adverse effects concerning sexual arousal and libido. We investigated the neural bases of paroxetine-related subjective sexual dysfunction when compared with bupropion and placebo. We scanned 18 healthy, heterosexual males in a randomized, double-blind, within-subject design while watching video clips of erotic and nonerotic content under steady-state conditions after taking 20 mg of paroxetine, 150 mg of bupropion, and placebo for 7 days each. Under paroxetine, ratings of subjective sexual dysfunction increased compared with placebo or bupropion. Activation along the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including subgenual, pregenual, and midcingulate cortices, in the ventral striatum and midbrain was decreased when compared with placebo. In contrast, bupropion let subjective ratings and ACC activations unchanged and increased activity of brain regions including posterior midcingulate cortex, mediodorsal thalamus, and extended amygdala relative to placebo and paroxetine. Brain regions that have been related to the processing of motivational (ventral striatum), emotional, and autonomic components of erotic stimulation (anterior cingulate) in previous studies showed reduced responsiveness under paroxetine in our study. Drug effects on these regions may be part of the mechanism underlying SSRI-related sexual dysfunction. Increased activation under bupropion may point to an opposite effect that may relate to the lack of impaired sexual functioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21544071,N,pharma study,,,

With longer functional time, the problem of driveline infection is becoming more urgent. No material or scaffold has been found, which allows a permanent and stable ingrowth of skin cells that would prevent (pathogenic) germs entering the body. Usually, the epithelial cells die at the exit site and new cells form a sulcus around the driveline, which grows deeper and finally becomes infected. The purpose of this project is to present a solution to this problem by elaborating a new mechanism, the active skin-penetrating device. The device is composed of a tube with a 5-mm diameter, a protective sleeve that surrounds the catheter exit site, and an active traction device. The protective sleeve is made of thin polyurethane covered with polyethylenterephtalat (PET, i.e. Dacron) fibers to permit the attachment of keratinocytes, similar to the standard driveline. The active traction device exerts a constant pull on the protective sleeve. The ingrown keratinocytes slowly give way and the protective sleeve gradually moves out of the body at a rate of a few millimeters per week. Meanwhile, the keratinocytes transform into horny cells and are then shed as in natural skin. Therefore, the formation of a sulcus is avoided, and the protective sleeve remains infection-free. In a first proof of the concept, four of the new devices and 10 control devices were implanted in goats. The devices remained infection-free for a period of 420 days, whereas four of the 10 control devices became infected. On the basis of these experiments, the active skin-penetrating device has been further developed and is being tested again in goats in a refined version. The results so far indicate that with the active-skin penetrating device an infection-resistant percutaneous energy transfer can be achieved for a prolonged period of time.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21843295,N,no brain data,,,

We evaluated the contributions of electrodermal activity to amygdala-parahippocampal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during phobic memory encoding in subjects with spider or snake phobia. Recognition memory was increased for phobia-related slides and covaried with rCBF in the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus. The covariation between parahippocampal rCBF and recognition was related to electrodermal activity suggesting that parahippocampal memory processes were associated with sympathetic activity. Electrodermal activity further mediated the amygdala effect on parahippocampal activity. Memory encoding during phobic fear therefore seems contingent on amygdala's influence on arousal and parahippocampal activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21729104,N,clinical,,,

Studies in humans and animals indicate that predictable and unpredictable aversive events can induce phasic and sustained fear, respectively. Research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear. We explored this issue in humans by examining threat predictability in three virtual reality contexts, one in which electric shocks were predictably signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks occurred unpredictably but never paired with a cue, and a third in which no shocks were delivered. Evidence of threat-induced phasic and sustained fear was presented using fear ratings and skin conductance. Utilizing recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we were able to conduct whole-brain fMRI at relatively high spatial resolution and still have enough sensitivity to detect transient and sustained signal changes in the basal forebrain. We found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala, but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex. Consistent with animal models hypothesizing a role for the cortex in generating sustained fear, sustained signal increases to unpredictable threat were also found in anterior insula and a frontoparietal cortical network associated with hypervigilance. In addition, unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala-hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses. In line with basic findings in rodents, these results provide evidence that phasic and sustained fear in humans may manifest similar signs of distress, but appear to be associated with different patterns of neural activity in the human basal forebrain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21111828,N,no phys of interest,,,

The diagnosis relies critically on the lack of consistent signs of purposeful behavior in response to external stimulation. Yet, given that patients with disorders of consciousness often exhibit fragmented movement patterns, voluntary actions may go unnoticed. Here we designed a simple motor paradigm that could potentially detect signs of purposeful behavior in VS patients with mild to severe brain damage by examining the neural correlates of motor preparation in response to verbal commands. Twenty-four patients who met the diagnostic criteria for VS were recruited for this study. Eleven of these patients showing preserved auditory evoked potentials underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test for basic speech processing. Five of these patients, who showed word related activity, were included in a second fMRI study aimed at detecting functional changes in premotor cortex elicited by specific verbal instructions to move either their left or their right hand. Despite the lack of overt muscle activity, two patients out of five activated the dorsal premotor cortex contralateral to the instructed hand, consistent with movement preparation. Our results may reflect residual voluntary processing in these two patients.

Here, we report on NBSs that accompany hemodynamic changes in regions devoid of neural tissue. The NBSs were investigated with high-resolution studies of the visual cortex (VC) at 7 T. Task-activation studies were performed to localize a task-positive area in the VC. During rest, robust negative correlation with the task-positive region was observed in focal regions near the ventricles and dispersed throughout the VC. Both positive and NBSs were dependent on behavioral condition. Comparison with high-resolution structural images showed that negatively correlated regions overlapped with larger pial and ependymal veins near sulcal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Results from multiecho fMRI showed that NBSs were consistent with increases in local blood volume. These findings confirm theoretical predictions that tie neural activity to blood volume increases, which tend to counteract positive fMRI signal changes associated with increased blood oxygenation.

RESULTS: Despite the presence of some intersubject variability, the following general brain activation patterns were revealed: As expected, lip movements after FNIG led to selective brain activation in the original facial motor cortex, and lip movements after HFA were associated with activation in the hypoglossal motor cortex. Following HFJA, lip movements resulted in overlapping activation encompassing both the original facial and the hypoglossal motor cortex, but tongue movements led solely to strong activation within the original hypoglossal motor cortex. In contrast, tongue movements after HFA were associated with strong activation in the original hypoglossal motor cortex and weaker activation in the facial motor cortex.

METHODS: Thirty-one healthy volunteers (15 male; age range, 22-38 years) participated in the study. The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire was used to assess neuroticism. Skin conductance level, pain ratings, and functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during anticipation of pain and painful esophageal distention. The effect of neuroticism was assessed using correlation analysis. RESULTS: There was a wide spread of neuroticism scores (range, 0-22) but no influence of neuroticism on skin conductance level and pain tolerance or pain ratings. However, a positive correlation between brain activity and neuroticism during anticipation was found in regions associated with emotional and cognitive pain processing, including the parahippocampus, insula, thalamus, and anterior cingulate cortex. These regions showed a negative correlation with neuroticism during pain (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel data suggesting higher neuroticism is associated with engagement of brain regions responsible for emotional and cognitive appraisal during anticipation of pain but reduced activity in these regions during pain. This may reflect a maladaptive mechanism in those with higher neuroticism that promotes overarousal during anticipation and avoidance coping during pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699797,N,no corr,,,

The effectiveness of monetary reinforcers during aversive learning and associated neural basis, however, remains a topic of debate. Specifically, it is unclear if the initial acquisition of aversive representations of monetary losses depends on similar neural systems as more traditional aversive conditioning that involves primary reinforcers. This study contrasts the efficacy of a biologically defined primary reinforcer (shock) and a socially defined secondary reinforcer (money) during aversive learning and its associated neural circuitry. During a two-part experiment, participants first played a gambling game where wins and losses were based on performance to gain an experimental bank. Participants were then exposed to two separate aversive conditioning sessions. In one session, a primary reinforcer (mild shock) served as an unconditioned stimulus (US) and was paired with one of two colored squares, the conditioned stimuli (CS+ and CS-, respectively). In another session, a secondary reinforcer (loss of money) served as the US and was paired with one of two different CS. Skin conductance responses were greater for CS+ compared to CS- trials irrespective of type of reinforcer. Neuroimaging results revealed that the striatum, a region typically linked with reward-related processing, was found to be involved in the acquisition of aversive conditioned response irrespective of reinforcer type. In contrast, the amygdala was involved during aversive conditioning with primary reinforcers, as suggested by both an exploratory fMRI analysis and a follow-up case study with a patient with bilateral amygdala damage. Taken together, these results suggest that learning about potential monetary losses may depend on reinforcement learning related systems, rather than on typical structures involved in more biologically based fears.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637321,N,no corr,,,

A subset of these regions demonstrated a linear pattern of increased responding from safe to medium to strong trials, including the bilateral insula, ACC, and inferior frontal gyrus. These responses were modulated by individual differences in neuroticism, such that those high in neuroticism showed exaggerated anxiety experience across the entire task, and reduced brain activation from medium to strong trials in a subset of brain regions.

Behaviorally, subjects retrospectively misidentified a learned threat as a more intense stimulus and expressed greater skin conductance responses (SCR) to generalized stimuli of high intensity. Brain activity related to intensity-based fear generalization was observed in the striatum, insula, thalamus/periacqueductal gray, and subgenual cingulate cortex. The psychophysiological expression of generalized fear correlated with amygdala activity, and connectivity between the amygdala and extrastriate visual cortex was correlated with individual differences in trait anxiety.

During emotional empathy, patients with BPD exhibited greater brain activity than controls in the right middle insular cortex, a response that was associated with skin conductance responses in the patients. Results indicate that altered functioning of the STS/STG and insula represents pathophysiological mediators for reduced empathy in BPD, with an important role for intrusive symptomatology and levels of arousal.

Given known increases in catastrophic injury due to falls with older age, understanding the neural basis of proprioceptive processing for balance control is particularly important for older adults. In the present study, we linked neural activity in response to stimulation of key foot proprioceptors (i.e., muscle spindles) with balance ability across the lifespan. Twenty young and 20 older human adults underwent proprioceptive mapping; foot tendon vibration was compared with vibration of a nearby bone in an fMRI environment to determine regions of the brain that were active in response to muscle spindle stimulation. Several body sway metrics were also calculated for the same participants on an eyes-closed balance task. Based on regression analyses, multiple clusters of voxels were identified showing a significant relationship between muscle spindle stimulation-induced neural activity and maximum center of pressure excursion in the anterior-posterior direction. In this case, increased activation was associated with greater balance performance in parietal, frontal, and insular cortical areas, as well as structures within the basal ganglia. These correlated regions were age- and foot-stimulation side-independent and largely localized to right-sided areas of the brain thought to be involved in monitoring stimulus-driven shifts of attention.

However, it is not known to what extent CAN activation patterns reflect muscle sensory inputs, top-down signals from the motor cortex, and/or motor drive to cardiovascular structures. The present study explored the functional representation of somatosensory afferent input within the CAN with an a priori interest in the insula and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) (n = 12). Heart rate (HR) and functional MRI data were acquired during 1) 30 s periods of electrical stimulation of the wrist flexors at sub-motor (SUB; Type I,II afferents) and 2) motor thresholds (MOT; Type I,II,III afferents), 3) volitional wrist flexion at 5% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) to match the MOT tension (VOL5%), and 4) volitional handgrip at 35% MVC to elicit tachycardia (VOL35%). Compared with rest, HR did not change during SUB, MOT, or VOL5% but increased during VOL35% (p < 0.001). High frequency HR variability was 29.42 ± 18.87 ms2 (mean ± S.D.) at rest and 39.85 ± 27.60 ms2 during SUB (p = 0.06). High frequency HR variability was decreased during VOL35% compared to rest (p ≤ 0.005). SUB increased activity in the bilateral posterior insula, vMPFC, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), and posterior cingulate cortex. MOT increased activity in the left posterior insula and MCC. During VOL5%, activity increased in the right anterior-mid insula. VOL35% was associated with activity in the bilateral insula as well as vMPFC and subgenual ACC deactivation. These data suggest that the left posterior insula processes sensory input from muscle during passive conditions and specifically that Type I and/or II muscle afferent stimulation during SUB impacts the vMPFC and/or subgenual ACC, regions believed to be involved in brain default mode and parasympathetic activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20884359/,M,uns about coords,rand,,

Behaviorally, we found that subjects made healthier choices in the presence of health cues. In parallel, stimulus value signals in ventromedial prefrontal cortex were more responsive to the healthiness of foods in the presence of health cues, and this effect was modulated by activity in regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction of brain and the activation of BAT by analyzing differences in brain metabolism between patients with and without activated BAT. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) was used to determine the activation of BAT and brain metabolism. After reviewing FDG PET/CT scans, we retrospectively collected 42 patients, 21 with activated BAT and 21 matched controls without activated BAT. We used the method of defining regions of interest (ROI) to examine differences in metabolism between their hypothalami and voxel (volumetric pixel)-based statistical parametric mapping to analyze the whole brain.

Informal clinical observations suggest that DbetaH-deficient patients do not have obvious cognitive impairments, even when they are not medicated, which is remarkable given the important role of norepinephrine in normal neurocognitive function. This study provided the first systematic investigation of neurocognitive function in human DbetaH deficiency. We tested 5 DbetaH-deficient patients and 10 matched healthy control participants on a comprehensive cognitive task battery, and examined their pupil dynamics, brain structure, and the P3 component of the electroencephalogram. All participants were tested twice; the patients were tested once ON and once OFF medication. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain revealed that the patients had a smaller total brain volume than the control group, which is in line with the recent hypothesis that norepinephrine has a neurotrophic effect. In addition, the patients showed an abnormally small or absent task-evoked pupil dilation. However, we found no substantial differences in cognitive performance or P3 amplitude between the patients and the control participants, with the exception of a temporal-attention deficit in the patients OFF medication.

METHODS: Nineteen FMS female patients and 22 age-matched healthy female controls were enrolled in this study. Changes in cerebral activation area were measured using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast fMRI after application of both medium and high pressure stimuli to the left thumbnail bed. RESULTS: We identified the insular cortex (IC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) as regions of interest (ROIs) in this analysis. Cerebral activation at the bilateral IC in response to high pressure stimuli was significantly greater in FMS patients than it was in the controls, whereas there were no differences in BOLD signal changes in the STG regions between FMS patients and controls, irrespective of pain level. Prominent signal changes at both ROIs in FMS patients were noted between high and medium pressure (p<0.001 contralateral IC, p=0.001 for ipsilateral IC, p=0.008 for contralateral STG, and p=0.049 for ipsilateral STG). BOLD signal changes on the contralateral STG after medium stimuli were correlated with tender point count (r=0.586, p=0.013).

In these studies, it is important to provide behavioral evidence of conditioning to verify that differences in brain activity are learning-related and correlated with human behavior. Fear conditioning studies often monitor autonomic responses (e.g. skin conductance response; SCR) as an index of learning and memory. In addition, other behavioral measures can provide valuable information about the learning process and/or other cognitive functions that influence conditioning. For example, the impact unconditioned stimulus (UCS) expectancies have on the expression of the conditioned response (CR) and unconditioned response (UCR) has been a topic of interest in several recent studies. SCR and UCS expectancy measures have recently been used in conjunction with fMRI to investigate the neural substrates of aware and unaware fear learning and memory processes. Although these cognitive processes can be evaluated to some degree following the conditioning session, post-conditioning assessments cannot measure expectations on a trial-to-trial basis and are susceptible to interference and forgetting, as well as other factors that may distort results. Monitoring autonomic and behavioral responses simultaneously with fMRI provides a mechanism by which the neural substrates that mediate complex relationships between cognitive processes and behavioral/autonomic responses can be assessed. However, monitoring autonomic and behavioral responses in the MRI environment poses a number of practical problems. Specifically, 1) standard behavioral and physiological monitoring equipment is constructed of ferrous material that cannot be safely used near the MRI scanner, 2) when this equipment is placed outside of the MRI scanning chamber, the cables projecting to the subject can carry RF noise that produces artifacts in brain images, 3) artifacts can be produced within the skin conductance signal by switching gradients during scanning, 4) the fMRI signal produced by the motor demands of behavioral responses may need to be distinguished from activity related to the cognitive processes of interest. Each of these issues can be resolved with modifications to the setup of physiological monitoring equipment and additional data analysis procedures. Here we present a methodology to simultaneously monitor autonomic and behavioral responses during fMRI, and demonstrate the use of these methods to investigate aware and unaware memory processes during fear conditioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22006034,N,methods paper,,,

A design using an electric shock selected by subjects to be 'highly annoying but not painful' as an unconditioned stimulus (US) with partially reinforced cues allowed us to partly disentangle the expectancy- and prediction-error components from sensory components of the unconditioned response. RESULTS: Whereas responses to the conditioned stimulus (CS) were similar in PTSD and TENC, the former displayed higher putamen, insula, caudate and amygdala responses to the US. Reactivity to the US in the anterior insula correlated with PTSD symptom severity. Functional connectivity analyses using the putamen as a seed region indicated that TENC subjects had increased amygdala-putamen connectivity during US delivery; this connection was disengaged in PTSD.

The quantitative relationship between neuronal activity and the measured signals is not yet precisely known, with uncertainties remaining about the relative contribution by their metabolic and hemodynamic components. Empirical observations have demonstrated the importance of the latter component and suggested that micro-vascular anatomy has a potential influence. The recent development of a 3D computer-assisted method for micro-vascular cerebral network analysis has produced a large quantitative library on the microcirculation of the human cerebral cortex (Cassot et al., 2006), which can be used to investigate the hemodynamic component of brain activation through fluid dynamic modeling. For this purpose, we perform the first simulations of blood flow in an anatomically accurate large human intra-cortical vascular network (~10000 segments), using a 1D non-linear model taking account of the complex rheological properties of blood flow in microcirculation. This model predicts blood pressure, blood flow and hematocrit distributions, as well as volumes of functional vascular territories, and regional flow at voxel and network scales. First, the influence of the prescribed boundary conditions (BCs) on the baseline flow structure is investigated, highlighting relevant lower- and upper-bound BCs. Independent of these BCs, large heterogeneities of baseline flow from vessel to vessel and from voxel to voxel, are demonstrated. These heterogeneities are controlled by the architecture of the intra-cortical vascular network. In particular, a correlation between the blood flow and the proportion of vascular volume occupied by arterioles or venules, at voxel scale, is highlighted. Then, the extent of venous contamination downstream to the sites of neuronal activation is investigated, demonstrating a linear relationship between the catchment surface of the activated area and the diameter of the intra-cortical draining vein.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20869450,N,methods paper,,,

The present study aimed at directly comparing two subtypes of specific phobia: snake phobia (SP) representing the animal, and dental phobia (DP) representing the blood-injection-injury subtype. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activation and skin conductance was measured during phobogenic video stimulation in 12 DP, 12 SP, and 17 healthy controls. For SP, the previously described activation of fear circuitry structures encompassing the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus could be replicated and was furthermore associated with autonomic arousal. In contrast, DP showed circumscribed activation of the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex (PFC/OFC) when directly compared to SP, being dissociated from autonomic arousal. Results provide preliminary evidence for the idea that snake and dental phobia are characterized by distinct underlying neural systems during sustained emotional processing with evaluation processes in DP being controlled by orbitofrontal areas, whereas phobogenic reactions in SP are primarily guided by limbic and paralimbic structures. Findings support the current diagnostic classification conventions, separating distinct subtypes in DSM-IV-TR. They highlight that caution might be warranted though for generalizing findings derived from animal phobia to other phobic and anxiety disorders.

However its mode of action remains elusive. Since the long delay to meaningful effect suggests that ONS induces slow neuromodulation, we have searched for changes in central pain-control areas using metabolic neuroimaging. METHODS: Ten drCCH patients underwent an 18FDG-PET scan after ONS, at delays varying between 0 and 30 months. All were scanned with ongoing ONS (ON) and with the stimulator switched OFF. RESULTS: After 6-30 months of ONS, 3 patients were pain free and 4 had a >/= 90% reduction of attack frequency (responders). In all patients compared to controls, several areas of the pain matrix showed hypermetabolism: ipsilateral hypothalamus, midbrain and ipsilateral lower pons. All normalized after ONS, except for the hypothalamus. Switching the stimulator ON or OFF had little influence on brain glucose metabolism. The perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) was hyperactive in ONS responders compared to non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic normalization in the pain neuromatrix and lack of short-term changes induced by the stimulation might support the hypothesis that ONS acts in drCCH through slow neuromodulatory processes. Selective activation in responders of PACC, a pivotal structure in the endogenous opioid system, suggests that ONS could restore balance within dysfunctioning pain control centres. That ONS is nothing but a symptomatic treatment might be illustrated by the persistent hypothalamic hypermetabolism, which could explain why autonomic attacks may persist despite pain relief and why cluster attacks recur shortly after stimulator arrest.

Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and investigated brain processing associated with cutaneous sympathetic vasoconstrictor reflexes during noxious stimulation. When a classical fMRI analysis based on the applied block design was performed, we were able to detect activations well known to be engaged in the central processing of touch and pain. A parametric fMRI analysis in which cutaneous vasoconstrictor activity was correlated with MRI signals revealed two distinct patterns of brain activity. During (i) noxious stimulation itself, brain activity correlated with sympathetic activity in the anterior insula, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). During (ii) baseline, brain activity correlated with sympathetic activity in the VMPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), OFC, PCC, cuneus, precuneus, occipital areas, and hypothalamus. Conjunction analysis revealed significant similar responses during periods of noxious stimulation and periods of sympathetic activation in the anterior insula, ACC and VLPFC (activation) and VMPFC, OFC, PCC, cuneus and precuneus (deactivation). Therefore, we here describe a cerebral network which may be engaged in the processing of the autonomic subdimension of the human pain experience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21126587,Y,corr,uns,,

One approach is drug-challenge pharmaco-magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI). We have previously shown that intravenous administration of the 5-HT(2C) agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) elicits increases in blood oxygenation dependent signal (BOLD) in regions consistent with the distribution of 5-HT(2C) receptors. In the current study we determined whether BOLD signal responses to mCPP could be blocked by pre-treatment with a 5-HT(2C) antagonist. Healthy male volunteers received oral mirtazapine, 5-HT(2)/5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, or placebo 90min prior to intravenous mCPP challenge phMRI. BOLD signal increases following mCPP infusion occurred in areas known to be rich in 5-HT(2C) receptors such as the substantia nigra, hypothalamus, pallidum and amygdala. These responses were attenuated by mirtazapine pre-treatment. The results suggest that mCPP-challenge phMRI produces reliable patterns of response that are mediated by 5-HT(2C) receptors; these responses may therefore be useful in-vivo measures of 5-HT(2C) function in psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21726650,N,no phys of interest,,,

Due to the clinically heterogeneous nature of these disorders, studying the effect of genetic variation in the BDNF gene on a common attribute such as fear processing may elucidate how the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism impacts brain function. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging examine the effect of the BDNF Val66Met genotype on neural activity for fear processing. Forty healthy participants performed an implicit fear task during scanning, where subjects made gender judgments from facial images with neutral or fearful emotion. Subjects were tested for facial emotion recognition post-scan. Functional connectivity was investigated using psycho-physiological interactions. Subjects were genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the measures compared between genotype groups. Met carriers showed overactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brainstem and insula bilaterally for fear processing, along with reduced functional connectivity from the ACC to the left hippocampus, and impaired fear recognition ability. The results show that during fear processing, Met allele carriers show an increased neural response in regions previously implicated in mediating autonomic arousal. Further, the Met carriers show decreased functional connectivity with the hippocampus, which may reflect differential retrieval of emotional associations. Together, these effects show significant differences in the neural substrate for fear processing with genetic variation in BDNF.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310593,N,no phys of interest,,,

A simple way of elevating blood CO(2) concentrations to characterise subject differences in vascular reactivity is through breath-holds but two aspects of this measure are often neglected: (1) breath-holds are usually modelled as blocks even though CO(2) accumulates over time and (2) increases in CO(2) differ between subjects. This study demonstrates that the BOLD breath-hold response is best modelled by convolving the end-tidal CO(2) trace with a standard haemodynamic response function and including its temporal derivative. Inclusion of the BOLD breath-hold response as a voxel-dependent covariate in a group level analysis increases the spatial extent of activation in stimulus evoked and resting state datasets. By expressing the BOLD breath-hold response as a percentage signal increase with respect to an absolute change in the partial pressure of CO(2) (expressed in mmHg), the spatial extent of stimulus-evoked activation is further improved. This demonstrates that individual end-tidal CO(2) increases to breath-hold should be accounted for to provide an accurate measure of vascular reactivity resulting in more statistically active voxels in group level analyses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20682354,N,methods paper,,,

However, corresponding functional neuroimaging models are difficult to reconcile with functional imaging and electrophysiological findings in schizophrenia. Resolving the discrepancies between different observational levels is critical to understand the complex pharmacological ketamine action and its usefulness for modeling schizophrenia pathophysiology. METHODS: We conducted a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacoimaging study in twenty-four male volunteers. Subjects were given low-dose S-ketamine (bolus prior to functional imaging: 0.1mg/kg during 5min, thereafter continuous infusion: 0.015625mg/kg/min reduced by 10% every ten minutes) or placebo while performing a visual oddball task during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with continuous recording of event-related potentials (P300) and electrodermal activity (EDA). Before and after intervention, psychopathological status was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale. RESULTS: P300 amplitude and corresponding BOLD responses were diminished in the ketamine condition in cortical regions being involved in sensory processing/selective attention. In both measurement modalities separation of drug conditions was achieved with area under the curve (AUC) values of up to 0.8-0.9. Ketamine effects were also observed in the clinical, behavioral and peripheral physiological domains (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, reaction hit and false alarm rate, electrodermal activity and heart rate) which were in part related to the P300/fMRI measures. CONCLUSION: The findings from our ketamine experiment are consistent across modalities and directly related to observations in schizophrenia supporting the validity of the model.

As part of this process it is important to characterize and quantify putative metabolites. In contrast to the ubiquitous positron emission tomography (PET) tracer (18)F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]2FDG) which is phosphorylated and trapped intracellularly, the substitution of fluorine for a hydroxyl group at carbon-6 in [(18)F]6FDG should prevent its phosphorylation. Consequently, [(18)F]6FDG has the potential to trace the transport step of glucose metabolism without the confounding effects of phosphorylation and subsequent steps of metabolism. Herein the focus is to determine whether, and the degree to which, [(18)F]6FDG remains unchanged following intravenous injection. METHODS: Biodistribution studies were performed using 6FDG labeled with (18)F or with the longer-lived radionuclides (3)H and (14)C. Tissues were harvested at 1, 6, and 24 h following intravenous administration and radioactivity was extracted from the tissues and analyzed using a combination of ion exchange columns, high-performance liquid chromatography, and chemical reactivity. RESULTS: At the 1 h time-point, the vast majority of radioactivity in the liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and blood was identified as 6FDG. At the 6-h and 24-h time points, there was evidence of a minor amount of radioactive material that appeared to be 6-fluoro-6-deoxy-D-sorbitol and possibly 6-fluoro-6-deoxy-D-gluconic acid. CONCLUSION: On the time scale typical of PET imaging studies radioactive metabolites of [(18)F]6FDG are negligible.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718942,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 15.","Electrophysiology, behavioral, and neuroimaging studies have revealed sex-related differences in autonomic cardiac control, as reflected in measurements of heart rate variability (HRV). Imaging studies indicate that the neurobiological correlates of autonomic nervous system (ANS) function can be investigated by measuring indices of HRV during the performance of mildly strenuous motor tasks or mildly stressful cognitive tasks. In this preliminary study, fifteen male and seven female healthy subjects underwent H(2)(15)O-positron emission tomography (PET) and electrocardiograph (ECG) recording while performing a handgrip motor task and an n-back task. Indices of HRV were calculated and correlated with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). We hypothesized that sex differences would be evident in brain regions known to participate in autonomic regulation: the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala. Our study found that associations between rCBF and parasympathetic indices differed significantly between female and male subjects in the amygdala. Females showed a positive correlation between rCBF and parasympathetic indices while males exhibited negative correlations. This differential correlation of amygdala rCBF and parasympathetic activity between males and females may reflect differences in parasympathetic/sympathetic balance between sexes, consistent with known sexual dimorphism in the amygdala and closely related structures such as the hypothalamus. These preliminary imaging results are consistent with earlier reports of significant correlation between brain activity and HRV, and extend these findings by demonstrating prominent sex differences in the neural control of the ANS. While the generalizability of our results was limited by the small size of the study samples, the relatively robust effect size of the differences found between groups encourages further work in larger samples to characterize sex differences in the neural correlates of autonomic arousal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21414364,M,uns which coords,rand,,

In addition, stress-induced atrophy in the prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum which are involved in the goal-directed action and hypertrophy of the dorsolateral striatum which is critical for the habit action were parallel with the effects of chronic stress on behaviors. The present study tested whether these previous findings in animal studies are compatible in humans by analyzing effects of chronic stress on neural and cardiovascular responses, which are likely important for performing appropriate actions. Twenty healthy men exposed to low or high chronic job stress performed a stochastic reversal learning task, which required cognitive flexibility and the goal-directed action. Regional cerebral blood flow was evaluated during the task using (15)O-water positron emission tomography, and cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate were also measured. During the reversal learning task, whereas participants with low chronic job stress exhibited activity in the anterior caudate, as well as orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and midbrain, which might be related to the goal-directed action, participants with high chronic job stress exhibited no activity in such brain regions. Furthermore, participants with high chronic job stress exhibited less reactivity in diastolic blood pressure, which might be mediated by anterior cingulate cortical activity. These findings, in line with previous studies, suggested that chronic job stress correlates with less activity in brain regions related to the goal-directed action, and insensitive physiological responses in humans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21763760,Y,corr,,,

Animal research suggests that such effects may result from actions of catecholamines and glucocorticoids that converge in brain regions that regulate motivated behaviors and incentive processing. At present, however, little is known about the acute effects of stress on these circuits in humans. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), twenty-seven healthy young women performed a modified version of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task, which is known to robustly engage ventral striatal and medial prefrontal regions. To induce psychological stress, strongly aversive movie clips (versus neutral movie clips) were shown with the instruction to imagine being an eyewitness. Physiological (cortisol levels, heart rate frequency, and heart rate variability) and subjective measurements confirmed successful induction of moderate levels of acute psychological stress. Brain imaging data revealed that stress induction resulted in a significant decrease in reward-related responses in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) without affecting ventral striatal responses. Our results thus show that acute psychological stress induces regionally specific changes in functioning of incentive processing circuits. This regional specificity is in line with animal data showing inverted U-shaped relations between levels of stress-related neuromodulators and functioning of the PFC, a structure that is believed to be critical for coordinating behavior in accordance with higher order internal goals. Our findings thus suggest that stress-related increases in habitual and reward-seeking behaviors may be triggered primarily by an impairment of such PFC-dependent cognitive control mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21126593,N,no phys of interest,,,

Nitrite has been discovered to be a vasodilator that is preferentially harnessed in hypoxia. Thus, both infused and inhaled nitrite are being studied as therapeutic agents for a variety of diseases. In addition, nitrite derived from nitrate in the diet has been shown to decrease blood pressure and improve exercise performance. Thus, dietary nitrate may also be important when increased blood flow in hypoxic or ischemic areas is indicated. These conditions could include age-associated dementia and cognitive decline. The goal of this study was to determine if dietary nitrate would increase cerebral blood flow in older adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this investigation we administered a high vs. low nitrate diet to older adults (74.7+/-6.9 years) and measured cerebral perfusion using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. We found that the high nitrate diet did not alter global cerebral perfusion, but did lead to increased regional cerebral perfusion in frontal lobe white matter, especially between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex.

Interregional correlations of binding potential (BP) values were high for areas within DA pathways in younger and elderly adults alike. Furthermore, interregional correlations in D1 BP between DA pathways were uniformly high in younger adults, indicating that D1 receptor densities in striatal, limbic, and cortical areas are not regulated independently, despite dopaminergic innervation from different midbrain areas. For elderly adults, between-pathway correlations of D1 receptor densities were preserved only between mesolimbic and mesocortical areas, whereas striatal BPs were weakly related to those in limbic and neocortical regions. Importantly, weak between-pathway correlations in elderly adults were found only for the slower half of the sample when BP was estimated during a cognitive interference task. These results suggest that D1 receptor densities in different pathways are not regulated independently in younger adults, but segregate in older age, and that this segregation of D1 receptor systems may be related to age-related cognitive slowing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21258043,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2011 Jan 9.","Music, an abstract stimulus, can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal dopaminergic system. Using the neurochemical specificity of [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning, combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity, we found endogenous dopamine release in the striatum at peak emotional arousal during music listening. To examine the time course of dopamine release, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same stimuli and listeners, and found a functional dissociation: the caudate was more involved during the anticipation and the nucleus accumbens was more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. These results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. Notably, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the peak pleasure itself. Our results help to explain why music is of such high value across all human societies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21217764,N,no phys of interest,,,

We correlated executive function, attention and memory with BP control and cerebrovascular damage in 60 undemented middle-aged hypertensives at baseline and after 6-year follow-up. At first evaluation, the patients with poor BP control had higher score of white matter lesions, reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity and greater carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) than those with good BP control. Performance on executive tests correlated with IMT and with performance on attention tests, which was impaired by low diastolic BP. At long-term follow-up, performance in attention and executive tests improved in spite of the minor improvement of BP control, increased IMT and worse memory. Low diastolic BP has a negative effect on attention, which affects executive performance at first cross-sectional examination. This confounding effect has to be taken into consideration when planning studies on cognitive function. Longitudinal studies are required to unravel the effect of BP control on cognitive function, as only long-term antihypertensive treatment improves both attention and executive performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20237503,N,no brain data,,,

The objective of this study was to obtain (82)Rb dose estimates under stress. METHODS: (82)Rb biokinetics were obtained in 10 healthy volunteers (5 male, 5 female; mean age +/- SD, 33 +/- 10 y; age range, 18-50 y) using whole-body PET/CT. The 76-s half-life of (82)Rb and the corresponding need for pharmacologic vasodilation require that all imaging be completed within 10 min. To accommodate these constraints, while acquiring the data needed for dosimetry we used the following protocol. First, a whole-body attenuation correction CT scan was obtained. Then, a series of 3 whole-body PET scans was acquired after a single infusion of 1.53 +/- 0.12 GBq of (82)Rb at rest. Four minutes after the infusion of a 0.56 mg/kg dose of the vasodilator, dipyridamole, 3 serial whole-body PET scans were acquired after a single infusion of 1.50 +/- 0.16 GBq of (82)Rb under stress. The time-integrated activity coefficient (TIAC) for stress was obtained by scaling the mean rest TIAC obtained from our previous rest study by the stress-to-rest TIAC ratio obtained from the rest-stress measurements described in this report. RESULTS: The highest mean organ-absorbed doses under stress were as follows: heart wall, 5.1, kidneys, 5.0, lungs, 2.8, and pancreas, 2.4 muGy/MBq (19, 19, 10.4, and 8.9 mrad/mCi, respectively). The mean effective doses under stress were 1.14 +/- 0.10 and 1.28 +/- 0.10 muSv/MBq using the tissue-weighting factors of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, publications 60 and 103, respectively. CONCLUSION: Appreciable differences in source-organ biokinetics were observed for heart wall and kidneys during stress when compared with the previously reported rest study. The organ receiving the highest dose during stress was the heart wall.

In order to visualize negative PE signaling during fear conditioning, we employed combined functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and skin conductance response (SCR) measurements in a conditioning task with visual stimuli and mild electrical shocks. Positive PE signaling was associated with increased activation in the bilateral insula, supplementary motor area, brainstem, and visual cortices. Negative PE signaling was associated with increased activation in the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, the left lateral orbital gyrus, the middle temporal gyri, angular gyri, and visual cortices.

In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, subjects repeatedly viewed normed videos that displayed different degrees of aggressive behavior. We found a downward linear adaptation in skin conductance responses with increasing aggression and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. Our results further revealed adaptation in a fronto-parietal network including the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), right precuneus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules, again showing downward linear adaptations and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. Granger causality mapping analyses revealed attenuation in the left lOFC, indicating that activation during viewing aggressive media is driven by input from parietal regions that decreased over time, for more aggressive videos. We conclude that aggressive media activates an emotion-attention network that has the capability to blunt emotional responses through reduced attention with repeated viewing of aggressive media contents, which may restrict the linking of the consequences of aggression with an emotional response, and therefore potentially promotes aggressive attitudes and behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20934985,N,adolescents,,,

OBJECTIVES: In an effort to elucidate potential enhancing effects, we explored the impact of transdermal nicotine on neural functioning in minimally deprived smokers and, in addition, assessed differences between smokers and non-smokers using a mixed block/event-related fMRI design that attempted to isolate specific central executive operations (attentional switch events) within general WM function (task blocks). METHODS: In task blocks, participants performed a continuous counting paradigm that required the simultaneous maintenance of, and frequent switching of attentional focus between, two running tallies in WM on some trials. Cigarette smokers (n = 30) were scanned twice, once each with a nicotine and placebo patch, while non-smokers (n = 27) were scanned twice with no patch. RESULTS: Across both groups, task blocks were associated with bilateral activation, notably in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior insula, and parietal regions, whereas individual attentional switch trials were associated with activation in a similar, but predominantly left-lateralized network. Within the smoker group, although nicotine increased heart rate, altered performance and mood, and reduced tobacco cravings, no acute drug (state-like) effect on brain activity was detected for either the task or switch effects. However, relative to non-smokers, smokers showed greater tonic activation in medial superior frontal cortex, right anterior insula, and bilateral anterior PFC throughout task blocks (trait-like effect).

The third group (learned aware) was not informed about the contingencies, but learned them despite the distractors. Main effects of contingency awareness on conditioned responses emerged in several brain structures. Post hoc tests revealed differential dorsal anterior cingulate, insula and ventral striatum responses in aware conditioning only, whereas the amygdala was activated independent of contingency awareness. Differential responses of the hippocampus were specifically observed in learned aware subjects, indicating a role in the development of contingency awareness. The orbitofrontal cortex showed varying response patterns: lateral structures showed higher responses in instructed aware than unaware subjects, the opposite was true for medial parts. Conditioned subjective and electrodermal responses emerged only in the two aware groups.

METHODS: Forty-nine typically developing young adolescents participated in a social stress test during which they contributed salivary cortisol samples. Following this, they underwent rs-fMRI scanning. We examined the association of FC of the SN [composed of anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula regions] with cortisol responsivity. RESULTS: Greater cortisol responsivity was significantly positively correlated with higher FC between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (Cg25) and the SN, controlling for participant age.

These processes are coupled to the BOLD signal by different mechanisms, and represent variations with very different frequency content; however, because of the low sampling rate of fMRI, these signals are generally not separable by frequency, as the cardiac and respiratory waveforms alias into the LFO band. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of the individual noise processes by conducting concurrent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and fMRI studies on six subjects during a resting state acquisition. Three time series corresponding to LFO, respiration, and cardiac pulsation were extracted by frequency from the NIRS signal (which has sufficient temporal resolution to critically sample the cardiac waveform) and used as regressors in a BOLD fMRI analysis. Our results suggest that LFO and cardiac signals modulate the BOLD signal independently through the circulatory system. The spatiotemporal evolution of the LFO signal in the BOLD data correlates with the global cerebral blood flow.

During encoding, participants viewed unfamiliar faces, each paired with a job title and name. During retrieval, each learned face was presented with two job titles or two names, and participants were required to choose the correct job title or name. Retrieval success activity (RSA) was identified by comparing retrieval-phase activity for hits versus misses in N and J, and the RSAs in each task were compared between young and older adults. The study yielded three main findings. First, the hippocampus showed significant RSA in both tasks of N and J, and the activity was greater for young compared to older subjects. Second, the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) showed greater RSA in N than in J, but there was no age difference in the activity in this region. Third, functional connectivity between hippocampal and ATL activities in both retrieval tasks was higher for young than for older adults. Taken together, age-related differences in hippocampal activities and hippocampus-ATL connectivity could contribute to age-related decline in relational memory and to complaints of poor retrieval of people's names by older adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20350057,N,no phys of interest,,,

Additionally, heart rate was registered during the measurements, and subjective ratings of hunger/satiety and of the valence of chocolate milk were assessed using a Likert scale. RESULTS: In participants with anorexia nervosa, drinking chocolate milk in the hunger condition induced significant activations in the right amygdala and in the left medial temporal gyrus relative to healthy controls. When contrasting neuronal responses to drinking chocolate milk during satiety with those evoked during hunger, a significant activation was found in the left insula in healthy controls, whereas in participants with anorexia nervosa, neuronal activity in the inferior temporal gyrus, covering the extrastriate body area, was observed.

The validity of this profile was supported by heart rate variability (HRV) data showing a significant correspondence across participants between intensity ratings and HRV measurements obtained during fMRI. With this ecologically valid stimulus we found that narrative intensity was accompanied by activation in temporal cortices, medial geniculate nuclei in the thalamus and amygdala, brain regions that are all part of the system for processing conditioned emotional responses to auditory stimuli.

In the current study, we take advantage of a particularity of the Chinese writing system in order to manipulate word-likeness parametrically, from real characters, to pseudo-characters that vary in whether they contain phonological and semantic cues, to artificial stimuli with varying surface similarity to real characters. In a one-back task, BOLD activity in the left mid-fusiform was inversely related to word-likeness, such that the least activity was observed in response to real characters, and the greatest to artificial stimuli that violate the orthotactic constraints of the writing system. One possible explanation for this surprising result is that the short-term memory demands of the one-back task put more pressure on the visual system when other sources of information cannot be used to aid in detecting repeated stimuli. For real characters and, to a lesser extent for pseudo-characters, information about meaning and pronunciation can contribute to performance, whereas artificial stimuli are entirely dependent on visual information.

The extent of the reduction was more pronounced than similar indices obtained in visual-evoked fMRI, suggesting a selective suppression effect on resting-state neural activity.

During moving grating stimuli of 1, 2, 10 and 20Hz temporal frequencies, we measured 9.4-T BOLD fMRI responses simultaneously in the primary visual cortex of area 17 (A17) and area 18 (A18), and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of isoflurane-anesthetized cat. Our results showed that preferred temporal frequencies of the BOLD responses for A17, A18 and LGN were 3.1Hz, 4.5Hz and 6.0Hz, respectively, which were comparable to the previously reported electrophysiological data. Additionally, the difference of BOLD response onset time between LGN and A17 was 0.5s, which is 18 times larger than the difference of neural activity onset time between these areas. We then compared the frequency-dependent BOLD fMRI response of A17 with tissue partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) and electrophysiological data of the same animal model reported by Viswanathan and Freeman (Nature Neuroscience, 2007). The BOLD tuning curve resembled the low frequency band (<12Hz) of local field potential (LFP) tuning curve rather than spiking activity, gamma band (25-90Hz) of LFP, and tissue pO(2) tuning curves, suggesting that the BOLD fMRI signal relates closer to low frequency LFP.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21704712,N,methods paper,,,

It originates from both learned (e.g. adverse social conditioning) and innate (e.g. shyness) factors. Research on social anxiety has traditionally focused on negative emotions induced by visual and auditory social cues in socially anxious clinical populations, and posits a dysfunctional orbitofrontal-amygdala circuit as a primary etiological mechanism. Yet as a trait, social anxiety is independent of one's specific emotional state. Here we probe the neural substrate of intrinsic social anxiety by employing a unique type of social stimuli, airborne human social chemosensory cues that are inherently social, ubiquitously present, and yet operating below verbal awareness. We show that the adopted social chemosensory cues were not perceived to be human-related, did not differentially bias self-report of anxiety or autonomic nervous system responses, yet individuals with elevated social anxiety demonstrated a reduced recruitment of the orbitofrontal cortex to social chemosensory cues. No reciprocal activity in the amygdala was observed. Our findings point to an intrinsic neural substrate underlying social anxiety that is not associated with prior adverse social conditioning, thereby providing the first neural evidence for the inherent social aspect of this enigmatic phenomenon.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195189,N,no corr,,,

Nine patients with PTSD and six healthy trauma survivors were scanned while resting, clenching teeth, and listening to neutral and traumatic scripts. Brain function was evaluated using H2O15 positron emission tomography (PET). HR was monitored by electrocardiogram. Data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Subjects with PTSD exhibited a significant increase in HR upon exposure to traumatic scripts, while trauma survivors did not. Correlations between regional cerebral blood flow and HR were found only in patients with PTSD, in orbitofrontal, precentral and occipital regions. Neither group showed correlation between rCBF and HR in the amygdala or hippocampus.

METHODS: Ninty-seven cognitively normal participants underwent annual resting-state positron emission tomography scans at baseline and over a period of up to 8 years (mean interval, 7.4 years). Images quantifying voxel-wise longitudinal rates of CBF change were calculated and used to examine the relationship between baseline FCRP score and changes over time in regional CBF. Individual components of the FCRP score (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking status, and type 2 diabetes) were also correlated with changes in regional CBF to examine the independent contributions of each component to the overall pattern of change. RESULTS: Higher baseline FCRP scores were associated with accelerated longitudinal decline in CBF in orbitofrontal, medial frontal/anterior cingulate, insular, precuneus, and brain stem regions. Of the components that comprise the FCRP score, higher diastolic blood pressure and diabetes were associated independently with greater decline in the medial frontal/anterior cingulate and insular regions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline cardiovascular risk factors are associated with greater rates of decline in resting state regional brain function. The regions showing accelerated decline participate in higher-order cognitive processes and are also vulnerable to age-related neuropathology. These results, in conjunction with other studies, encourage early treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in older individuals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22492519,N,no specific phys,,,

We combined brainstem-sensitive functional magnetic resonance imaging with heart rate recording and time-resolved rating of the needling sensation to measure neuronal correlates of sensations and autonomic reactions during acupuncture. On the cortical level, needling sensation activated typical pain-related areas, of which the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex were further involved in mediating the heart rate response. In the brainstem, needling sensation activated nuclei of the descending pain control system, in which a network of hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, rostral ventromedial medulla, and ventrolateral medulla was identified as the source of the heart rate changes.

Epub 2011 Dec 19.","INTRODUCTION: We assessed sex differences in behavioural and neural responses to rectal pain stimuli in healthy subjects. METHODS: In age- and body mass index-matched healthy subjects (n = 15 men, 15 women), rectal sensory and pain thresholds were assessed with a pressure-controlled barostat device. The blood oxygen level-dependent response during cued anticipation and painful stimulation was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Retrospective pain evaluations were accomplished with visual analogue scales. For fMRI data, region-of-interest (ROI) analyses and additional whole-brain analyses were carried out. RESULTS: There were no sex differences in rectal thresholds or pain ratings. ROI analyses revealed comparable distension-induced activation of the thalamus, somatosensory cortex, insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Only in additional whole-brain analyses did we find increased activation in women in DLPFC and middle temporal gyrus during pain anticipation and in the cerebellum and medial frontal gyrus during pain. A significant inverse association between rectal pain threshold and distension-induced activation in virtually all ROIs was found in women. In men, pain thresholds and insula activation were positively correlated, as were pain ratings and anterior cingulate cortex activation. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy men and women do not differ in behavioural measures of visceral pain sensitivity. The pattern of neural activation is comparable in the majority of pain-processing brain regions, although women may differ in the activation of DLPFC which could reflect sex differences in cognitive-emotional pain regulation. Women with lower pain thresholds showed greater neural responses, which may be relevant in the pathophysiology of visceral hyperalgesia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22337318,N,no phys of interest,,,

Animal studies have shown that this could include enduring changes to brain serotonin neurotransmission. In the present study, we tested whether perinatal adversity in humans has a long-term impact on brain serotonin neurotransmission in adulthood. Twenty-six healthy males, recruited from a 27-year longitudinal study, underwent a positron emission tomography scan with the tracer alpha-[(1)(1)C]methyl-L-tryptophan ((1)(1)C-AMT), as an index of serotonin synthesis capacity. The trapping constant is taken as a proxy for the regional 5-HT synthesis. Birth complications, especially a delivery where the fetus showed signs of physiological distress, predicted lower (1)(1)C-AMT trapping in the hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Lower (1)(1)C-AMT trapping in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was also predicted by maternal smoking and lower birth weight. There were no effects of childhood or recent adversity. This is the first human study reporting associations between perinatal adversity and adult (1)(1)C-AMT trapping in the hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. The associations suggest that limbic serotonin pathways may be particularly vulnerable to environmental challenges during the period when they undergo the most prominent neurodevelopmental changes. In combination with other risk factors, perinatal stressors may contribute to increased vulnerability for psychiatric disorders in which serotonin plays a major role.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22257439,N,children,,,

Epub 2012 Jan 29.","Anxiety is typically considered an impediment to cognition. We propose anxiety-related impairments in cognitive-behavioral performance are the consequences of enhanced stimulus-driven attention. Accordingly, reflexive, habitual behaviors that rely on stimulus-driven mechanisms should be facilitated in an anxious state, while novel, flexible behaviors that compete with the former should be impaired. To test these predictions, healthy adults (N=17) performed a mixed-saccade task, which pits habitual actions (pro-saccades) against atypical ones (anti-saccades), under anxiety-inducing threat of shock and safe conditions. Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) captured oscillatory responses in the preparatory interval preceding target onset and saccade execution. Results showed threat-induced anxiety differentially impacted response times based on the type of saccade initiated, slowing anti-saccades but facilitating erroneous pro-saccades on anti-saccade trials. MEG source analyses revealed that successful suppression of reflexive pro-saccades and correct initiation of anti-saccades during threat was marked by increased theta power in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortical and midbrain regions (superior colliculi) implicated in stimulus-driven attention. Theta activity may delay stimulus-driven processes to enable generation of an anti-saccade. Moreover, compared to safety, threat reduced beta desynchronization in inferior parietal cortices during anti-saccade preparation but increased it during pro-saccade preparation. Differential effects in inferior parietal cortices indicate a greater readiness to execute anti-saccades during safety and to execute pro-saccades during threat. These findings suggest that, in an anxiety state, reduced cognitive-behavioral flexibility may stem from enhanced stimulus-driven attention, which may serve the adaptive function of optimizing threat detection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22289426,N,MEG,,,

Using resting-state fMRI and measures of empathy in healthy adults, we show that relative empathic ability (REA) is reflected in the brain's intrinsic functional dynamics. Dominance of AE was associated with stronger functional connectivity among social-emotional regions (ventral anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, perigenual anterior cingulate). Dominance of CE was related to stronger connectivity among areas implicated in interoception, autonomic monitoring and social-cognitive processing (brainstem, superior temporal sulcus, ventral anterior insula). These patterns were distinct from those observed with AE and CE separately. Finally, REA and the strength of several functional connections were associated with symptoms of psychopathology.

In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exaggerated stress-induced analgesia to trauma reminders was proposed. The present study investigated whether enhanced analgesia occurs in response to a trauma-unrelated cognitive stressor in PTSD. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from fourteen outpatients with PTSD and 14 trauma-exposed subjects without PTSD (NPTSD) during mechanical painful stimulation before and after stress. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses were assessed during painful stimulation. Pain ratings, pain thresholds and pain tolerance were assessed pre- and post-stress. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before, during and after stress. RESULTS: In comparison to NPTSD, PTSD-patients showed significantly more analgesia in terms of an increase of pain threshold and tolerance and a decrease in pain ratings after the stressor. Post-stress, PTSD-patients compared to NPTSD displayed more activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and decreased neural activity in brain areas associated with pain perception. However heart rate increase during stress and blood pressure decrease post-stress was lower in PTSD pointing to a dysregulation of the cardiovascular system in response to stress. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size represents a limiting factor in interpreting the results and might have led to low levels of significance for the group differences in BOLD response changes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show enhanced stress reactivity and accompanying reduced pain perception in PTSD-patients in contrast to traumatized participants without PTSD. The results suggest that the previously reported enhanced analgesic response after trauma-related stress in PTSD transfers to trauma-unrelated stressors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21733577,N,no corr,,,

This study investigated the neural correlates of observing social interactions in a business setting, in which whole-body dynamic stimuli displayed approach and avoidance behaviors that were preceded or not by a handshake and were followed by participants' ratings of these behaviors. First, approach was associated with more positive evaluations than avoidance behaviors, and a handshake preceding social interaction enhanced the positive impact of approach and diminished the negative impact of avoidance behavior on the evaluation of social interaction. Second, increased sensitivity to approach than to avoidance behavior in the amygdala and STS was linked to a positive evaluation of approach behavior and a positive impact of handshake. Third, linked to the positive effect of handshake on social evaluation, nucleus accumbens showed greater activity for Handshake than for No-handshake conditions.

Interestingly, omission of the aversive stimulus often produces another response around the time the event was expected. This omission response suggests that the subject detected a mismatch between what was predicted and what actually occurred, thereby providing an indirect measure of cognitive expectancy. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether omission-related brain activity reflects fear expectancy during learning and generalization of conditioned fear. During conditioning, a face expressing a moderate amount of fear (conditioned stimulus, CS+) signaled delivery of an aversive shock unconditioned stimulus (US), whereas the same face with a neutral expression was unreinforced. In a subsequent generalization test, subjects were presented with faces expressing more or less fear intensity than the CS+. Psychophysiological results revealed an increase in the skin conductance response (SCR) during learning when the US was omitted. Omission-related SCRs were also observed during the generalization test following the offset of high- but not low-intensity face expressions. Neuroimaging results revealed omission-related neural activity during learning in the anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, insula, and striatum. These same regions also showed omission-related responses during the generalization test following highly expressive fearful faces. Finally, regression analysis on omission responses during the generalization test revealed correlations in offset-related SCRs and neural activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex.

Epub 2012 Feb 9.","Confounding noise in BOLD fMRI data arises primarily from fluctuations in blood flow and oxygenation due to cardiac and respiratory effects, spontaneous low frequency oscillations (LFO) in arterial pressure, and non-task related neural activity. Cardiac noise is particularly problematic, as the low sampling frequency of BOLD fMRI ensures that these effects are aliased in recorded data. Various methods have been proposed to estimate the noise signal through measurement and transformation of the cardiac and respiratory waveforms (e.g. RETROICOR and respiration volume per time (RVT)) and model-free estimation of noise variance through examination of spatial and temporal patterns. We have previously demonstrated that by applying a voxel-specific time delay to concurrently acquired near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, we can generate regressors that reflect systemic blood flow and oxygenation fluctuations effects. Here, we apply this method to the task of removing physiological noise from BOLD data. We compare the efficacy of noise removal using various sets of noise regressors generated from NIRS data, and also compare the noise removal to RETROICOR+RVT. We compare the results of resting state analyses using the original and noise filtered data, and we evaluate the bias for the different noise filtration methods by computing null distributions from the resting data and comparing them with the expected theoretical distributions. Using the best set of processing choices, six NIRS-generated regressors with voxel-specific time delays explain a median of 10.5% of the variance throughout the brain, with the highest reductions being seen in gray matter. By comparison, the nine RETROICOR+RVT regressors together explain a median of 6.8% of the variance in the BOLD data. Detection of resting state networks was enhanced with NIRS denoising, and there were no appreciable differences in the bias of the different techniques. Physiological noise regressors generated using Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offer an effective method for efficiently removing hemodynamic noise from BOLD data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22342801,N,nirs,,,

Despite the absence of response monitoring demands and thus overt response conflicts, the experiment revealed a differential physiological response pattern as a function of item type. First, probes elicited the largest skin conductance responses. Second, differential hemodynamic responses were observed in bilateral inferior frontal regions, the right supramarginal gyrus and the supplementary motor area as a function of item type. Probes and targets were accompanied by a larger signal increase than irrelevant items in these regions. Moreover, the responses to probes differed substantially from targets.

In animals and humans, psychological stressors suppress the capacity of the arterial baroreflex to control short-term fluctuations in BP, reflected by reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). While animal studies have characterized the brain systems that link stressor processing to BRS suppression, comparable human studies are lacking. Here, we measured beat-to-beat BP and heart rate (HR) in 97 adults who performed a multisource interference task that evoked changes in spontaneous BRS, which were quantified by a validated sequence method. The same 97 participants also performed the task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity. Across participants, task performance (i) increased BP and HR and (ii) reduced BRS. Analyses of fMRI data further demonstrated that a greater task-evoked reduction in BRS covaried with greater activity in brain systems important for central autonomic and cardiovascular control, particularly the cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). Moreover, task performance increased the functional connectivity of a discrete area of the anterior insula with both the cingulate cortex and amygdala. In parallel, this same insula area showed increased task-evoked functional connectivity with midbrain PAG and pons. These novel findings provide human evidence for the brain systems presumptively involved in suppressing baroreflex functionality, with relevance for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of stressor-related cardiovascular reactivity and associated risk for essential hypertension and atherosclerotic heart disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21567664,Y,corr,rand,,

However, the representation of somatosensory afferents, and the consequent cardiovascular effects, may be modified by levels of baroreceptor input. Thus, we examined the cortical regions involved with processing somatosensory inputs during baroreceptor unloading. Neuroimaging sessions (functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) recorded brain activity during 30 mmHg lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) alone and combined with somatosensory stimulation (LBNP+SS) of the forearm (n = 14). Somatosensory processing was also assessed during increased sympathetic outflow via end-expiratory apnea. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (Q), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were recorded during the same protocols in a separate laboratory session. SS alone had no effect on any cardiovascular or MSNA variable at rest. Measures of HR, BP, and Q during LBNP were not different compared with LBNP+SS. The rise in MSNA burst frequency was attenuated during LBNP+SS versus LBNP alone (8 vs. 12 bursts/min, respectively, P < 0.05). SS did not affect the change in MSNA during apnea. Activations within the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) observed during LBNP were not seen during LBNP+SS. Anterior insula and ACC activations occurring during apnea were not modified by SS. Thus, the absence of insular and dorsal ACC activity during LBNP+SS along with an attenuation of MSNA burst frequency suggest sympathoinhibitory effects of sensory stimulation during decreased baroreceptor input by a mechanism that includes conjoint insula-dorsal ACC regulation.

Cardiac baroreceptors, activated at systole within each cardiac cycle, provide short-term visceral feedback. Here we explored how phasic baroreceptor activation may alter the appraisal of brief emotional stimuli and consequent cardiovascular reactions. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to measure brain responses to emotional face stimuli presented before and during cardiac systole. We observed that the processing of emotional stimuli was altered by concurrent natural baroreceptor activation. Specifically, facial expressions of disgust were judged as more intense when presented at systole, and rebound heart rate increases were attenuated after expressions of disgust and happiness. Neural activity within prefrontal cortex correlated with emotionality ratings. Activity within periaqueductal gray matter reflected both emotional ratings and their interaction with cardiac timing. Activity within regions including prefrontal and visual cortices correlated with increases in heart rate evoked by the face stimuli, while orbitofrontal activity reflected both evoked heart rate change and its interaction with cardiac timing. Our findings demonstrate that momentary physiological fluctuations in cardiovascular afferent information (1) influence specific emotional judgments, mediated through regions including the periaqueductal gray matter, and (2) shape evoked autonomic responses through engagement of orbitofrontal cortex. Together these findings highlight the close coupling of visceral and emotional processes and identify neural regions mediating bodily state influences on affective judgment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21988743,Y,corr,uns,,

Epub 2012 Apr 19.","In nonsedated newborn lambs, nasal pressure support ventilation (nPSV) can lead to an active glottal closure in early inspiration, which can limit lung ventilation and divert air into the digestive system, with potentially deleterious consequences. During volume control ventilation (nVC), glottal closure is delayed to the end of inspiration, suggesting that it is reflexly linked to the maximum value of inspiratory pressure. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to test whether inspiratory glottal closure develops at the end of inspiration during nasal neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (nNAVA), an increasingly used ventilatory mode where maximal pressure is also reached at the end of inspiration. Polysomnographic recordings were performed in eight nonsedated, chronically instrumented lambs, which were ventilated with progressively increasing levels of nPSV and nNAVA in random order. States of alertness, diaphragm, and glottal muscle electrical activity, tracheal pressure, Spo(2), tracheal Pet(CO(2)), and respiratory inductive plethysmography were continuously recorded. Although phasic inspiratory glottal constrictor electrical activity appeared during nPSV in 5 of 8 lambs, it was never observed at any nNAVA level in any lamb, even at maximal achievable nNAVA levels. In addition, a decrease in Pco(2) was neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of inspiratory glottal constrictor activity. In conclusion, nNAVA does not induce active inspiratory glottal closure, in contrast to nPSV and nVC. We hypothesize that this absence of inspiratory activity is related to the more physiological airway pressurization during nNAVA, which tightly follows diaphragm electrical activity throughout inspiration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22518828,N,animals,,,

This integrated part of the complex number furnished by the MR scanners can also be used for exploring direct detection of neuronal activity and for thermography. Few studies have explicitly addressed the issue of the available signal stability in the context of phase time-series, and therefore we explored the spatial pattern of frequency specific phase fluctuations, and evaluated the effect of physiological noise components (heart beat and respiration) on the phase signal. Three categories of retrospective noise reduction techniques were explored and the temporal signal stability was evaluated in terms of a physiologic noise model, for seven fMRI measurement protocols in eight healthy subjects at 3T, for segmented CSF, gray and white matter voxels. We confirmed that for most processing methods, an efficient use of the phase information is hampered by the fact that noise from physiological and instrumental sources contributes significantly more to the phase than to the magnitude instability. Noise regression based on the phase evolution of the central k-space point, RETROICOR, or an orthonormalized combination of these were able to reduce their impact, but without bringing phase stability down to levels expected from the magnitude signal. Similar results were obtained after targeted removal of scan-to-scan variations in the bulk magnetic field by the dynamic off-resonance in k-space (DORK) method and by the temporal off-resonance alignment of single-echo time series technique (TOAST). We found that spatial high-pass filtering was necessary, and in vivo a Gaussian filter width of 20mm was sufficient to suppress physiological noise and bring the phase fluctuations to magnitude levels. Stronger filters brought the fluctuations down to levels dictated by thermal noise contributions, and for 62.5mm(3) voxels the phase stability was as low as 5 mrad (0.27 degrees ). In conditions of low SNR(o) and high temporal sampling rate (short TR); we achieved an upper bound for the phase instabilities at 0.0017 ppm, which is close to the dHb contribution to the GM/WM phase contrast.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079450,N,methods paper,,,

While the majority of brain imaging studies of emotion have utilised the galvanic skin response as a means of inferring changes in skin sympathetic nerve activity (SSNA), spontaneous fluctuations in the galvanic skin response bear little relation to spontaneous fluctuations in SSNA. To improve our understanding of the central neural processes involved in the generation of autonomic emotional markers, we recorded SSNA concurrently with brain functional magnetic resonance imaging in 13 subjects. Emotional changes were evoked by presentation of positively-charged (erotica) or negatively-charged (mutilation) images from the International Affective Picture System. Positive and negative emotionally-charged images evoked significant increases in total SSNA and signal intensity in the orbital, dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and anterior insula. Increases in signal intensity during increases in SSNA occurred in a number of brain regions, including the central and lateral amygdala, dorsolateral pons, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellar cortex.

Moreover, they might play a pivotal role in conveying the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of a (more or less) stronger proneness for, or resilience against psychopathology. There are only few insights in the neurobiology of genetically and environmentally based individual differences in fear learning and extinction. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 74 healthy subjects were investigated. These were invited according to 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 (S+ vs. L(A)L(A); triallelic classification) and TPH2 (G(-703)T) (T+ vs. T-) genotype. The aim was to investigate the influence of genetic factors and traumatic life events on skin conductance responses (SCRs) and neural responses (amygdala, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)) during acquisition and extinction learning in a differential fear conditioning paradigm. Fear acquisition was characterized by stronger late conditioned and unconditioned responses in the right insula in 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers. During extinction traumatic life events were associated with reduced amygdala activation in S-allele carriers vs. non-carriers. Beyond that, T-allele carriers of the TPH2 (G(-703)T) polymorphism with a higher number of traumatic life events showed enhanced responsiveness in the amygdala during acquisition and in the vmPFC during extinction learning compared with non-carriers. Finally, a combined effect of the two polymorphisms with higher responses in S- and T-allele carriers was found in the dACC during extinction. The results indicate an increased expression of conditioned, but also unconditioned fear responses in the insula in 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers. A combined effect of the two polymorphisms on dACC activation during extinction might be associated with prolonged fear expression. Gene-by-environment interactions in amygdala and vmPFC activation may reflect a neural endophenotype translating genetic and adverse environmental influences into vulnerability for or resilience against developing affective psychopathology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22957066,N,no phys of interest,,,

Traditionally, speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SATs) have been almost exclusively ascribed to changes in the amount of sensory evidence required to support a response (""response caution"") and the neural correlates associated with the later stages of decision making (e.g., motor response generation and execution). Here, we investigated whether performance decrements under speed pressure also reflect suboptimal information processing in early sensory areas such as primary visual cortex (V1). Human subjects performed an orientation discrimination task while emphasizing either response speed or accuracy. A model of choice behavior revealed that the rate of sensory evidence accumulation was selectively modulated when subjects emphasized accuracy, but not speed, suggesting that changes in sensory processing also influence the SAT. We then used fMRI and a forward encoding model to derive orientation-selective tuning functions based on activation patterns in V1. When accuracy was emphasized, the extent to which orientation-selective tuning profiles exhibited a theoretically optimal gain pattern predicted both response accuracy and the rate of sensory evidence accumulation. However, these relationships were not observed when subjects emphasized speed.

SETTING: Academic medical center at Stanford University School of Medicine. PATIENTS: Twelve adults with high and 12 adults with low hypnotizability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure functional connectivity networks at rest, including default-mode, salience, and executive-control networks; structural T1 magnetic resonance imaging to measure regional gray and white matter volumes; and diffusion tensor imaging to measure white matter microstructural integrity. RESULTS: High compared with low hypnotizable individuals had greater functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an executive-control region of the brain, and the salience network composed of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, amygdala, and ventral striatum, involved in detecting, integrating, and filtering relevant somatic, autonomic, and emotional information using independent component analysis. Seed-based analysis confirmed elevated functional coupling between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in high compared with low hypnotizable individuals.

The retrieval of fear extinction memories (safety signals) may be particularly affected; although schizophrenic patients can extinguish conditioned fear, they show a deficit in retrieving fear extinction memories after a delay. The neurobiological basis of this abnormality is unknown, but clues have emerged from studies in rodents and humans demonstrating that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a key mediator of extinction memory retrieval. OBJECTIVE To measure autonomic and neural responses during the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear and the delayed recall of fear and extinction memories in patients with schizophrenia and healthy control participants. DESIGN Cross-sectional case control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study. SETTING Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Twenty schizophrenic patients and 17 healthy control participants demographically matched to the patient group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Skin conductance and blood oxygen level-dependent responses. RESULTS During fear conditioning, schizophrenic patients showed blunted autonomic responses and abnormal blood oxygen level-dependent responses, relative to control participants, within the posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and other regions. Several of these abnormalities were linked to negative symptoms. During extinction learning, patients with schizophrenia and control participants showed comparable autonomic and neural responses. Twenty-four hours after the learning phases, the control subjects exhibited decreased fear and increased vmPFC responses in the extinction (safe) context as expected, indicating successful retention of the extinction memory. In contrast, the schizophrenic patients showed inappropriately elevated fear and poor vmPFC responses in the safe context. CONCLUSION Failure of extinction memory retrieval in schizophrenia is associated with vmPFC dysfunction. In future studies, abnormalities in fear learning and extinction recall may serve as quantitative phenotypes that can be linked to genetic, symptom, or outcome profiles in schizophrenia and those at risk for the disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22945619,N,no corr,,,

Although it is increasingly acknowledged that central nervous system mechanisms contribute to pain amplification and chronicity in TMDs, further research is needed to unravel neural correlates that might abet the development of chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: The insular cortex (IC) and cingulate cortex (CC) are both critically involved in the experience of pain. The current study sought specifically to investigate IC-CC functional connectivity in TMD patients and healthy controls (HCs), both during resting state and during the application of a painful stimulus. METHODS: Eight patients with TMD, and 8 age- and sex-matched HCs were enrolled in the present study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data during resting state and during the performance of a pressure pain stimulus to the temple were acquired. Predefined seed regions were placed in the IC (anterior and posterior insular cortices) and the extracted signal was correlated with brain activity throughout the whole brain. Specifically, we were interested whether TMD patients and HCs would show differences in IC-CC connectivity, both during resting state and during the application of a painful stimulus to the face. RESULTS: As a main finding, functional connectivity analyses revealed an increased functional connectivity between the left anterior IC and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in TMD patients, during both resting state and applied pressure pain. Within the patient group, there was a negative correlation between the anterior IC-ACC connectivity and clinical pain intensity as measured by a visual analog scale. CONCLUSIONS: Since the pregenual region of the ACC is critically involved in antinociception, we hypothesize that an increase in anterior IC-ACC connectivity is indicative of an adaptation of the pain modulatory system early in the chronification process.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21929661,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2011 Nov 11.","The understanding of individual differences in responses to disgusting stimuli is important to gain more insight into the development of certain psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate conditioned disgust responses, its potential overlap with conditioned fear responses (CRs) and the influence of disgust sensitivity on blood oxygen level-dependent responses. Yet even though current studies report evidence that disgust sensitivity is a vulnerability factor, the knowledge about the underlying neural mechanisms remains very limited. Two groups were exposed either to a disgust- or a fear-conditioning paradigm. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified a conjoint activated network including the cingulate cortex, the nucleus accumbens, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the occipital cortex within the disgust- and the fear-conditioning group. Moreover, we report evidence of increased insula activation in the disgust-conditioning group. In addition, functional connectivity analysis revealed increased interconnections, most pronounced within the insula in the high disgust sensitivity group compared with the low disgust sensitivity group. The conjunction results suggest that the conditioned responses in disgust and fear conditioning recruit the same neural network, implicating that different conditioned responses of aversive learning depend on a common neural network. Increased insula activation within the disgust-conditioning group might be attributable to heightened interoceptive processes, which might be more pronounced in disgust. Finally, the findings regarding disgust sensitivity are discussed with respect to vulnerability factors for certain psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22108614,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 1.","Resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that allows repeated assessments of functional connectivity in resting state. While task-related FMRI is limited to indirectly measured drug effects in areas affected by the task, resting state can show direct CNS effects across all brain networks. Hence, RS-FMRI could be an objective measure for compounds affecting the CNS. Several studies on the effects of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB(1))-receptor agonist delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on task-dependent FMRI have been performed. However, no studies on the effects of cannabinoids on resting state networks using RS-FMRI have been published. Therefore, we investigated the effects of THC on functional brain connectivity using RS-FMRI. Twelve healthy volunteers (9 male, 3 female) inhaled 2, 6 and 6 mg THC or placebo with 90-minute intervals in a randomized, double blind, cross-over trial. Eight RS-FMRI scans of 8 min were obtained per occasion. Subjects rated subjective psychedelic effects on a visual analog scale after each scan, as pharmacodynamic effect measures. Drug-induced effects on functional connectivity were examined using dual regression with FSL software (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford). Eight maps of voxel-wise connectivity throughout the entire brain were provided per RS-FMRI series with eight predefined resting-state networks of interest. These maps were used in a mixed effects model group analysis to determine brain regions with a statistically significant drug-by-time interaction. Statistical images were cluster-corrected, and results were Bonferroni-corrected across multiple contrasts. THC administration increased functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network, and was associated with dissociable lateralized connectivity changes in the right and left dorsal visual stream networks. The brain regions showing connectivity changes included the cerebellum and dorsal frontal cortical regions. Clear increases were found for feeling high, external perception, heart rate and cortisol, whereas prolactin decreased. This study shows that THC induces both increases and (to a lesser extent) decreases in functional brain connectivity, mainly in brain regions with high densities of CB(1)-receptors. Some of the involved regions could be functionally related to robust THC-induced CNS-effects that have been found in previous studies (Zuurman et al., 2008), such as postural stability, feeling high and altered time perception.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22885247,N,pharma study,,,

Here, we investigated olfactory sensory perception of threat as an alternative causal mechanism of anxiety. Combining an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm with an olfactory discrimination task, we examined how anxiety modulates basic perception of olfactory threats at behavioral and neural levels. In spite of subthreshold presentation of negative and neutral odors, a positive systematic association emerged between negative odor discrimination accuracy and anxiety levels. In parallel, the right olfactory primary (piriform) cortex indicated augmented response to subthreshold negative (vs. neutral) odors as a function of individual differences in anxiety. Using a psychophysiological interaction analysis, we further demonstrated amplified functional connectivity between the piriform cortex and emotion-related regions (amygdala and hippocampus) in response to negative odor, particularly in anxiety. Finally, anxiety also intensified skin conductance response to negative (vs. neutral) odor, indicative of potentiated emotional arousal to subliminal olfactory threat in anxiety. Together, these findings elucidate exaggerated processing of olfactory threat in anxiety across behavioral, autonomic physiological, and neural domains. Critically, our data emphasized anxiety-related hyper-sensitivity of the primary olfactory cortex and basic olfactory perception in response to threat, highlighting neurosensory mechanisms that may underlie the deleterious symptoms of anxiety.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22866182,N,no corr,,,

We investigated the brain mechanisms of these perceptual differences. METHODS: We analyzed data from 44 women with IBS and 20 female healthy subjects (controls). IBS symptom severity was determined by a severity scoring system. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression score. Blood oxygen level-dependent signals were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during expectation and delivery of high (45 mmHg) and low (15 mmHg) intensity rectal distensions. Perception thresholds to rectal distension were determined in the scanner. Brain imaging data were compared among 18 normosensitive and 15 hypersensitive patients with IBS and 18 controls. Results were reported significant if peak P-values were </=.05, with family-wise error correction in regions of interest. RESULTS: The subgroups of patients with IBS were similar in age, symptom duration, psychological symptoms, and IBS symptom severity. Although brain responses to distension were similar between normosensitive patients and controls, hypersensitive patients with IBS had greater activation of insula and reduced deactivation in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex during noxious rectal distensions, compared to controls and normosensitive patients with IBS. During expectation of rectal distension, normosensitive patients with IBS had more activation in right hippocampus than controls.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate sex differences in brain activity in these regions during fear conditioning and extinction. METHODS: Subjects were 12 healthy men comparable to 12 healthy women who underwent a 2-day experiment in a 3 T MR scanner. Fear conditioning and extinction learning occurred on day 1 and extinction recall occurred on day 2. The conditioned stimuli were visual cues and the unconditioned stimulus was a mild electric shock. Skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded throughout the experiment as an index of the conditioned response. fMRI data (blood-oxygen-level-dependent [BOLD] signal changes) were analyzed using SPM8. RESULTS: Findings showed no significant sex differences in SCR during any experimental phases. However, during fear conditioning, there were significantly greater BOLD-signal changes in the right amygdala, right rostral anterior cingulate (rACC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in women compared with men. In contrast, men showed significantly greater signal changes in bilateral rACC during extinction recall.

Epub 2012 Mar 6.","Carbon dioxide (CO(2)), a potent vasodilator, is known to have a significant impact on the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. With the growing interest in studying synchronized BOLD fluctuations during the resting state, the extent to which the apparent synchrony is due to variations in the end-tidal pressure of CO(2) (PETCO(2)) is an important consideration. CO(2)-related fluctuations in BOLD signal may also represent a potential confound when studying task-related responses, especially if breathing depth and rate are affected by the task. While previous studies of the above issues have explored retrospective correction of BOLD fluctuations related to arterial PCO(2), here we demonstrate an alternative approach based on physiological clamping of the arterial CO(2) level to a near-constant value. We present data comparing resting-state functional connectivity within the default-mode-network (DMN), as well as task-related BOLD responses, acquired in two conditions in each subject: 1) while subject's PETCO(2) was allowed to vary spontaneously; and 2) while controlling subject's PETCO(2) within a narrow range. Strong task-related responses and areas of maximal signal correlation in the DMN were not significantly altered by suppressing fluctuations in PETCO(2). Controlling PETCO(2) did, however, improve the performance of retrospective physiological noise correction techniques, allowing detection of additional regions of task-related response and resting-state connectivity in highly vascularized regions such as occipital cortex.

A large corpus of candidate gene studies indicate that individual differences in amygdala activity may be caused by genetic variants within monoaminergic signaling pathways such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. However, to our knowledge, the use of genome-wide data to discover genetic variants underlying individual differences in adult amygdala activity is novel. In the present study, the combination of genome-wide data and functional imaging phenotypes from an emotional faces task yielded a significant association between rs10014254 and the amygdala using a region of interest approach. This single nucleotide polymorphism is located in a regulatory region upstream of the Paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) gene; therefore it could affect the expression of this gene. PHOX2B regulates the expression of enzymes necessary for the synthesis of several monoamines and is essential for the development of the autonomic nervous system. However, an attempt to replicate the finding in an independent sample from North America did not succeed. The synthesis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and genome-wide data takes a hypothesis-free approach as to which genetic variants are of interest. Therefore, we believe that an undirected finding within such a plausible region is of interest, and that our results add further support to the hypothesis that monoaminergic signaling pathways play a central role in regulating amygdala activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22856363,N,no phys of interest,,,

Real-time fMRI using whole brain 4-slab EVI with 286 ms temporal resolution (4mm isotropic voxel size) and partial brain 2-slab EVI with 136 ms temporal resolution (4x4x6 mm(3) voxel size) was performed on a clinical 3 Tesla MRI scanner equipped with 12-channel head coil. Four-slab EVI of visual and motor tasks significantly increased mean (visual: 96%, motor: 66%) and maximum t-score (visual: 263%, motor: 124%) and mean (visual: 59%, motor: 131%) and maximum (visual: 29%, motor: 67%) BOLD signal amplitude compared with EPI. Time domain moving average filtering (2s width) to suppress physiological noise from cardiac and respiratory fluctuations further improved mean (visual: 196%, motor: 140%) and maximum (visual: 384%, motor: 200%) t-scores and increased extents of activation (visual: 73%, motor: 70%) compared to EPI. Similar sensitivity enhancement, which is attributed to high sampling rate at only moderately reduced temporal signal-to-noise ratio (mean: -52%) and longer sampling of the BOLD effect in the echo-time domain compared to EPI, was measured in auditory cortex. Two-slab EVI further improved temporal resolution for measuring task-related activation and enabled mapping of five major resting state networks (RSNs) in individual subjects in 5 min scans. The bilateral sensorimotor, the default mode and the occipital RSNs were detectable in time frames as short as 75 s. In conclusion, the high sampling rate of real-time multi-slab EVI significantly improves sensitivity for studying the temporal dynamics of hemodynamic responses and for characterizing functional networks at high field strength in short measurement times.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22398395,N,methods paper,,,

Stress-sensitive neuromodulators (e.g., catecholamines) are believed to cause this low reliability by altering neurocognitive processes underlying memory formation. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated neural activity during memory formation in 44 young, healthy human participants while incidentally encoding emotionally neutral, complex scenes embedded in either a stressful or neutral context. We recorded event-related pupil dilation responses as an indirect index of phasic noradrenergic activity. Autonomic, endocrine, and psychological measures were acquired to validate stress manipulation. Acute stress during encoding led to a more liberal response bias (more hits and false alarms) when testing memory for the scenes 24 h later. The strength of this bias correlated negatively with pupil dilation responses and positively with stress-induced heart rate increases at encoding. Acute stress, moreover, reduced subsequent memory effects (SMEs; items later remembered vs forgotten) in hippocampus and midbrain, and in pupil dilation responses. The diminished SMEs indicate reduced selectivity and specificity in mnemonic processing during memory formation. This is in line with a model in which stress-induced catecholaminergic hyperactivation alters phasic neuromodulatory signaling in memory-related circuits, resulting in generalized (gist-based) processing at the cost of specificity. Thus, one may speculate that loss of specificity may yield less discrete memory representations at time of encoding, thereby causing a more liberal response bias when probing these memories.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22442069,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2011 Apr 27.","BACKGROUND: Neuromodulatory techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been increasingly studied as possible treatments for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. tDCS is capable of inducing changes in regional cerebral blood flow in both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by positron emission tomography studies, and might conceivably affect hypothalamic and autonomic nervous system functions. However, it remains unknown whether acute changes in autonomic or hypothalamic functions may be triggered by conventional tDCS protocols. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To verify whether tDCS, when performed with a bipolar cephalic montage, is capable of inducing acute changes in autonomic or hypothalamic functions in healthy subjects. METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers were studied. tDCS was performed with the anode over the C3 position and the cathode over the right supraorbital region. Subjects received either real or sham tDCS. Parameters assessed before and after a 20-minute session included blood pressure, tympanic thermometry, hand skin temperature, heart rate and ventilatory rate. Plasma concentrations of cortisol were also measured in a sub-set of 10 participants. RESULTS: A repeated-measures, mixed-design ANOVA showed significant changes in hand skin temperature (P = .005) and cortisol levels (P < .001) after both real and sham stimulation. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the other measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in hand temperature and cortisol levels, having occurred in both the sham and experimental groups, probably reflect a non-specific stress response to a new procedure. There were no significant changes in autonomic functions, ventilation rate or core body temperature that can be attributed to conventional tDCS applied to healthy volunteers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037121,N,clinical,,,

Epub 2012 Jan 8.","Dynamic functional integration of distinct neural systems plays a pivotal role in emotional experience. We introduce a novel approach for studying emotion-related changes in the interactions within and between networks using fMRI. It is based on continuous computation of a network cohesion index (NCI), which is sensitive to both strength and variability of signal correlations between pre-defined regions. The regions encompass three clusters (namely limbic, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and cognitive), each previously was shown to be involved in emotional processing. Two sadness-inducing film excerpts were viewed passively, and comparisons between viewer's rated sadness, parasympathetic, and inter-NCI and intra-NCI were obtained. Limbic intra-NCI was associated with reported sadness in both movies. However, the correlation between the parasympathetic-index, the rated sadness and the limbic-NCI occurred in only one movie, possibly related to a ""deactivated"" pattern of sadness. In this film, rated sadness intensity also correlated with the mPFC intra-NCI, possibly reflecting temporal correspondence between sadness and sympathy. Further, only for this movie, we found an association between sadness rating and the mPFC-limbic inter-NCI time courses. To the contrary, in the other film in which sadness was reported to commingle with horror and anger, dramatic events coincided with disintegration of these networks. Together, this may point to a difference between the cinematic experiences with regard to inter-network dynamics related to emotional regulation. These findings demonstrate the advantage of a multi-layered dynamic analysis for elucidating the uniqueness of emotional experiences with regard to an unguided processing of continuous and complex stimulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22285693,N,FC analysis,,,

We observed an almost linear increase of perceived loudness and percent signal change from baseline (PSC) in all examined stages of the upper auditory pathway. Across individuals, the slope of the underlying growth function for perceived loudness was significantly correlated with the slope of the growth function for the PSC in the auditory cortex, but not in subcortical structures.

Our model for some of the molecular mechanics of this regulation of energy stores is based on the concept of a neurally encoded 'threshold' for minimum body fat, below which compensatory physiology is invoked to restore body fat. The existence of such a centrally encoded threshold is supported by the similarities in response to maintenance of a reduced weight between lean and obese individuals, and the tendency for weight-reduced individuals to regain weight to levels of fat stores similar to those present prior to initial weight loss. Brain responses to food and the observed changes in energy expenditure that occur during maintenance of a reduced weight are largely reversed by the administration of the adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin. .",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23128762,N,no brain data,,,

Behavioral results from the conditioning session revealed that participants learned normally and fMRI data recorded during learning identified a number of stimulus-evoked changes that were consistent with previous work. A direct comparison between the pre- and post-conditioning amygdala connectivity revealed a region of dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the superior frontal gyrus that showed a significant increase in connectivity following the conditioning session. A behavioral measure of explicit memory performance was positively correlated with the change in amygdala connectivity within a neighboring region in the superior frontal gyrus. Additionally, an implicit autonomic measure of conditioning was positively correlated with the change in connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The resting-state data show that amygdala connectivity is altered following Pavlovian fear conditioning and that these changes are also related to behavioral outcomes.

Recent research suggests that stress may alter the contributions of multiple memory systems to learning, yet the underlying mechanism in the human brain remains completely unknown.

We found that stress reduced declarative knowledge about the learning task and changed the used learning strategy from a single-cue-based declarative strategy to a multicue-based procedural strategy, whereas learning performance per se remained unaffected by stress. Neuroimaging revealed that hippocampal activity correlated positively with task performance in the control condition, whereas striatal activity correlated with performance in the stress condition. After stress, hippocampal activity was reduced and even negatively correlated with learning performance. These findings show for the first time that stress alters the engagement of multiple memory systems in the human brain. Stress impaired the hippocampus-dependent system and allowed the striatum to control behavior.

The present study tested the hypothesis that HDBR deconditioning would modify the forebrain organization for heart rate (HR) control during baroreflex unloading. Heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure and plasma hormones were analysed at rest, whereas HR and cortical autonomic activation patterns (functional magnetic resonance imaging) were measured during graded and randomly assigned lower body negative pressure treatments (LBNP, -15 and -35 mmHg) both before (Pre) and after (Post) a 24 h HDBR protocol (study 1; n = 8). An additional group was tested before and following diuretic-induced hypovolaemia (study 2; n = 9; spironolactone, 100 mg day(-1) for 3 days) that mimicked the plasma volume lost during HDBR (-15% in both studies; P < 0.05). Head-down bed rest with hypovolaemia did not affect baseline HR, mean arterial pressure, HRV or plasma catecholamines. Head-down bed rest augmented the LBNP-induced HR response (P < 0.05), and this was associated with bed-rest-induced development of the following changes: (i) enhanced activation within the genual anterior cingulate cortex and the right anterior insular cortex; and (ii) deactivation patterns within the subgenual regions of the anterior cingulate cortex. Diuretic treatment (without HDBR) did not affect baseline HR and mean arterial pressure, but did reduce resting HRV and elevated circulating noradrenaline and plasma renin activity (P < 0.05). The greater HR response to LBNP following diuretic (P < 0.05) was associated with diminished activation of the right anterior insula. Our findings indicate that 24 h of HDBR minimized the impact of diuretic treatment on baseline autonomic and cardiovascular variables. The findings also indicate that despite the similar augmentation of HR responses to LBNP and despite similar pre-intervention cortical activation patterns, HDBR and diuretic treatment produced different effects on the cortical responses, with HDBR affecting anterior cingulate cortex and right insula regions, whereas diuretic treatment affected primarily the right insula alone, but in a direction that was opposite to HDBR. The data indicate that physical deconditioning can induce rapid functional changes within the cortical circuitry associated with baroreflex unloading, changes that are distinct from diuretic-induced hypovolaemia.

We here aimed to identify the DMN in the challenging patient population of disorders of consciousness encountered following coma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A spatial independent component analysis-based methodology permitted DMN assessment, decomposing connectivity in all its different sources either neuronal or artifactual. Three different selection criteria were introduced assessing anticorrelation-corrected connectivity with or without an automatic masking procedure and calculating connectivity scores encompassing both spatial and temporal properties. These three methods were validated on 10 healthy controls and applied to an independent group of 8 healthy controls and 11 severely brain-damaged patients [locked-in syndrome (n = 2), minimally conscious (n = 1), and vegetative state (n = 8)]. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: All vegetative patients showed fewer connections in the default-mode areas, when compared with controls, contrary to locked-in patients who showed near-normal connectivity. In the minimally conscious-state patient, only the two selection criteria considering both spatial and temporal properties were able to identify an intact right lateralized BOLD connectivity pattern, and metabolic PET data suggested its neuronal origin.

While we obtained concurrent fear-potentiated startle, neuroimaging (fMRI), and US-expectancy data, healthy participants underwent a fear-conditioning paradigm in which one of two conditioned stimuli (CS(+) but not CS(-)) was paired with a shock (unconditioned stimulus [US]).

We examined individual differences in discriminative fear conditioning by classifying participants (as conditionable vs. unconditionable) according to whether they showed successful differential startle potentiation.

In the current study we investigated whether cortisol levels under relatively stress-free circumstances are related to amygdala resting-state functional connectivity with the mPFC. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 20 healthy male participants. Salivary cortisol was sampled at multiple times throughout the experiment. The cortisol area under the curve increase (AUCi) was calculated as a measure of cortisol dynamics. Next, seed based correlations were employed on the resting-state fMRI data to reveal regions of amygdala functional connectivity related to variations in cortisol AUCi. The resulting statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster based thresholding (Z>2.3, p<.05). Two regions in the mPFC showed decreasing negative functional connectivity with the amygdala when a lesser decrease in cortisol AUCi was observed: the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal pole (BA10). Although we initially showed a relation with cortisol AUCi, it seemed that the baseline cortisol levels were actually driving this effect: higher baseline cortisol levels related to stronger negative functional connectivity with the mPFC. Endogenous cortisol levels may modulate amygdala functional connectivity with specific regions in the mPFC, even under relatively stress-free circumstances. Our results corroborate previous findings from both animal and human studies, suggesting cortisol-mediated regulation of the amygdala by the mPFC. We propose that through this feedback mechanism the stress response might be adjusted, pointing to the putative role of cortisol in modulating stress- and, more generally, emotional responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22204928,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, the mechanisms mediating symptom reduction and their underlying neurobiological processes are poorly understood. Therefore, we presented the same fear-relevant and neutral stimuli repeatedly to individuals with high and low fear of animals during fMRI scanning. High-, but not low-fearful individuals showed an initial fear-stimulus-related potentiation of amygdala and insula activity. Potentiation of the amygdala in the high-fearful group habituated quickly, but insula activity was still potentiated during later repetition trials. Both groups showed an initial potentiation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) that continuously decreased in low-, but not in high-fearful participants. Thus, within-session habituation may occur on an automatic processing level (amygdala), but does not cause lasting neural changes on a higher order cortical level (dmPFC).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22913381,N,no phys of interest,,,

Previous studies have focused on reward anticipation or on rewarded executive functioning tasks and have described a striatal hyporesponsiveness and orbitofrontal alterations in adult and adolescent ADHD. Passive reward delivery and its link to behavioral impulsivity are less well understood. To study this crucial aspect of reward processing we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electrodermal assessment in male and female adult ADHD patients (N=28) and matched healthy control participants (N=28) during delivery of monetary and non-monetary rewards. Further, two behavioral tasks assessed risky decision making (game of dice task) and delay discounting. Results indicated that both groups activated ventral and dorsal striatum and the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) in response to high-incentive (i.e. monetary) rewards. A similar, albeit less strong activation pattern was found for low-incentive (i.e. non-monetary) rewards. Group differences emerged when comparing high and low incentive rewards directly: activation in the mOFC coded for the motivational change in reward delivery in healthy controls, but not ADHD patients. Additionally, this dysfunctional mOFC activity in patients correlated with risky decision making and delay discounting and was paralleled by physiological arousal. Together, these results suggest that the mOFC codes reward value and type in healthy individuals whereas this function is deficient in ADHD. The brain-behavior correlations suggest that this deficit might be related to behavioral impulsivity. Reward value processing difficulties in ADHD should be considered when assessing reward anticipation and emotional learning in research and applied settings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22197790,N,no phys of interest,,,

This is demonstrated during Pavlovian fear conditioning when the unconditioned response (UCR) to a predictable unconditioned stimulus (UCS) is diminished compared to the UCR to an unpredictable UCS. The present study investigated the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal response associated with Pavlovian conditioned UCR diminution to better understand the relationship between individual differences in behavior and the neural mechanisms of the threat-related emotional response. Healthy volunteers participated in a fear conditioning study in which trait anxiety, skin conductance response (SCR), UCS expectancy, and the fMRI signal were assessed. During acquisition trials, a tone (CS+) was paired with a white noise UCS and a second tone (CS-) was presented without the UCS. Test trials consisted of the CS+ paired with the UCS, CS- paired with the UCS, and presentations of the UCS alone to assess conditioned UCR diminution. UCR diminution was observed within the dorsolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), anterior insula, and amygdala. The threat-related activity within the dorsolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, posterior cingulate cortex, and IPL varied with individual differences in trait anxiety. In addition, anticipatory (i.e. CS elicited) activity within the PFC showed an inverse relationship with threat-related (i.e. UCS elicited) activity within the PFC, IPL, and amygdala. Further, the emotional response (indexed via SCR) elicited by the threat was closely linked to amygdala activity.

This study sought to investigate the impact of autonomic dysfunction by Ewing's classification on functional outcome 2 months after acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: 34 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients within 7 days after onset were enrolled. On admission, autonomic function was assessed by Ewing's battery tests. Stroke severity was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), autonomy in activities of daily living by the Barthel Index (BI), and global disability by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). BI and mRS were also evaluated 2 months after ischemic stroke onset. RESULTS: On admission, eight patients were diagnosed as minor autonomic dysfunction and 26 patients as relatively severe autonomic dysfunction. The prevalence of relatively severe autonomic dysfunction in ischemic stroke patients was 76.5%. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the minor and severe autonomic dysfunction groups. 2 months after stroke onset, the mean BI score of patients with minor autonomic dysfunction and severe autonomic dysfunction increased from 76.3+/-15.3 on admission to 95.0+/-7.1, 66.5+/-15.2 on admission to 74.8+/-15.9 respectively. The mean BI score after 2-month stroke onset and the change in BI from admission to 2-month outcome (delta BI) in patients with severe autonomic dysfunction were lower than those in patients with minor autonomic dysfunction (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic dysfunction occurs in acute stroke patients. Relatively severe autonomic dysfunction is related to an unfavorable functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22088362,N,clinical,,,

The current study addressed this gap in knowledge by examining the neural convergence of these two phenomena within the same population. In one task, participants monitored their own heartbeat; in another task they watched emotional video clips and rated their own emotional responses to the videos. Consistent with prior research, heartbeat monitoring engaged a circumscribed area spanning insular cortex and adjacent inferior frontal operculum. Critically, this interoception-related cluster also was engaged when participants rated their own emotion, and activity here correlated with the trial-by-trial intensity of participants' emotional experience.

Many studies sought to identify the neural correlates of heightened arousal as indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR). However, the observed regional activations may be confounded by task events. We addressed this issue by recording SCR in 25 adults performing a stop signal task (SST) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compared only go trials with high and low SCR in order to isolate the event-independent processes. Furthermore, we distinguished go trials that followed another go, a stop success, or a stop error trial to examine whether the neural activities are contingent on the local context in which changes in SCR occurred. The results showed that the supplementary motor area responded to increased SCR irrespective of the preceding trial. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex increased activation to heightened arousal most significantly in response to stop errors. The medial prefrontal cortex increased activation to SCR following a stop error but decreased activation following a go or stop success trial. These new findings specify the regional activations that accompany changes in physiological arousal during the SST and support distinct processes for the changes that occur under different local contexts. In particular, the MPFC shows opposing responses by increasing activation to changes in arousal evoked by salient stimuli and decreasing activation to the control of arousal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22634217,N,contrast,rand,,

Predictions are demonstrated to have a close fit to recorded physiological phase, with median Pearson correlation scores between recorded and predicted values of 0.99 for the best case scenario (cardiac cycle trained on a subject's own data) down to 0.83 for the worst case scenario (respiratory predictions trained on group data), as compared to random chance correlation score of 0.70.

Using Fourier transforms and seed based correlation analysis, RETROICOR is shown to produce similar effects whether recorded physiological phase values are used, or they are predicted using this technique. This was seen by similar levels of noise reduction noise in the same regions of the Fourier spectra, and changes in seed based correlation scores in similar regions of the brain.

In each experimental trial, participants saw a picture of a forest location followed by a picture of a spider, snake, or bird, and then rated their personal risk of encountering these animals in this context, as well as their fear. The greater the visual avoidance of spiders that a phobic participant demonstrated (as measured by eye tracking), the higher were her autonomic arousal and neural activity in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus at picture onset. Visual avoidance of spiders in phobics also went hand in hand with subsequently reduced cognitive risk of encounters.

In addition, they showed reduced encounter risk estimates when they looked longer at the animal pictures. Our data are consistent with the idea that one reason for phobics to avoid phobic information may be grounded in heightened activity in the fear circuit, which signals potential threat. Because of the absence of alternative efficient regulation strategies, visual avoidance may then function to down-regulate cognitive risk evaluations for threatening information about the phobic stimuli. Control participants, in contrast, may be characterized by a different coping style, whereby paying visual attention to potentially threatening information may help them to actively down-regulate cognitive evaluations of risk.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23754994,Y,corr,uns,,

Stimuli were initiated for 10 s from a baseline resting temperature (32 degrees C) to three different levels (37, 42, 45 degrees C). RESULTS: Significantly increased heat pain thresholds were observed in patients. A stronger activation during heat pain perception was found in the left posterior insula in controls. In contrast, higher levels of activity were shown in the ipsilateral pons in patients when compared to controls. In patients, we found a significant interrelation between the depression score (Beck depression inventory) and heat pain activations. CONCLUSION: We suggest that reduced activity in the left posterior insula might contribute to increased pain thresholds in patients, while increased activations in the right anterior insula and pons mirror augmented sympathetic modulation putatively related to amplification of adrenergic descending pain inhibition.

Despite a preserved performance during visuo-spatial attention task, AP induced increased reaction times and a positive modulation on the activation of the right posterior parietal cortex, the occipital cortex, the periaquiductal gray, and nuclei of the brainstem. We speculate that this modulation of brain activity represents, at different anatomical levels, a compensation mechanism to maintain cognitive efficiency under parasympathetic stimulation, which is traditionally considered as the system for energy regain and storage.

This effect is hypothesized to result from testosterone's down regulating effects on the amygdala, a key region in the detection of threat and instigator of fight-or-flight behavior. However, neuroimaging studies employing testosterone administration in humans have consistently shown increased amygdala responsivity. Yet, no study to date has investigated specifically how testosterone affects the amygdala response to fearful emotional expressions. Such stimuli signal the presence of environmental threat and elicit robust amygdala responses that have consistently been associated with anxious traits. In the present study, we therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with a single administration of 0.5mg testosterone in 12 healthy women to assess testosterone's effects on amygdala responses to dynamic fearful (and happy control) faces. Our results show that both stimuli activate the amygdala. Notably, testosterone increased the amygdala response to both stimuli, and to an equal degree. Thus, testosterone appears not to reduce fear by attenuating the amygdala response toward signals of threat. Data further show that testosterone selectively increases activation of the superficial amygdala (SFA) and, to a lesser extent, the basolateral amygdala (BLA). No effect was found in the central nucleus, which is involved in the generation of autonomic fear responses. Both the SFA and BLA are considered input regions, and enhanced activation by testosterone might reflect the role of this hormone in adaptive responding to socially relevant stimuli. Furthermore, literature on the distinct roles of the SFA and BLA in fear processing show that increased activation of these subregions of the amygdala is consistent with a fear reducing effect of testosterone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999654,N,no phys of interest,,,

A pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted with a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, investigating effects of the endocannabinoid agonist 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain function related to emotional processing in 11 healthy subjects. Performance and brain activity during matching of stimuli with a negative ('fearful faces') or a positive content ('happy faces') were assessed after placebo and THC administration. After THC administration, performance accuracy was decreased for stimuli with a negative but not for stimuli with a positive emotional content. Our task activated a network of brain regions including amygdala, orbital frontal gyrus, hippocampus, parietal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and regions in the occipital cortex. THC interacted with emotional content, as activity in this network was reduced for negative content, while activity for positive content was increased. These results indicate that THC administration reduces the negative bias in emotional processing.

Beyond Noise: Using Temporal ICA to Extract Meaningful Information from High-Frequency fMRI Signal Fluctuations during Rest,Front Hum Neurosci,"Boubela, Roland N,Kalcher, Klaudius,Huf, Wolfgang,Kronnerwetter, Claudia,Filzmoser, Peter,Moser, Ewald,eng,P 23533/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria,Switzerland,Front Hum Neurosci. 2013 May 1;7:168. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2013.00168. eCollection 2013.","Analysis of resting-state networks using fMRI usually ignores high-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal - be it because of low TR prohibiting the analysis of fluctuations with frequencies higher than 0.25 Hz (for a typical TR of 2 s), or because of the application of a bandpass filter (commonly restricting the signal to frequencies lower than 0.1 Hz). While the standard model of convolving neuronal activity with a hemodynamic response function suggests that the signal of interest in fMRI is characterized by slow fluctuation, it is in fact unclear whether the high-frequency dynamics of the signal consists of noise only. In this study, 10 subjects were scanned at 3 T during 6 min of rest using a multiband EPI sequence with a TR of 354 ms to critically sample fluctuations of up to 1.4 Hz. Preprocessed data were high-pass filtered to include only frequencies above 0.25 Hz, and voxelwise whole-brain temporal ICA (tICA) was used to identify consistent high-frequency signals. The resulting components include physiological background signal sources, most notably pulsation and heart-beat components, that can be specifically identified and localized with the method presented here. Perhaps more surprisingly, common resting-state networks like the default-mode network also emerge as separate tICA components. This means that high-frequency oscillations sampled with a rather T1-weighted contrast still contain specific information on these resting-state networks to consistently identify them, not consistent with the commonly held view that these networks operate on low-frequency fluctuations alone. Consequently, the use of bandpass filters in resting-state data analysis should be reconsidered, since this step eliminates potentially relevant information. Instead, more specific methods for the elimination of physiological background signals, for example by regression of physiological noise components, might prove to be viable alternatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23641208,N,methods paper,,,

However, the brainstem's location close to major arteries and adjacent pulsatile cerebrospinal fluid filled spaces, means that it is difficult to reliably record functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from. These physiological sources of noise generate time varying signals in fMRI data, which if left uncorrected can obscure signals of interest. In this Methods Article we will provide a practical introduction to the techniques used to correct for the presence of physiological noise in time series fMRI data. Techniques based on independent measurement of the cardiac and respiratory cycles, such as retrospective image correction (RETROICOR, Glover et al., 2000), will be described and their application and limitations discussed. The impact of a physiological noise model, implemented in the framework of the general linear model, on resting fMRI data acquired at 3 and 7 T is presented. Data driven approaches based such as independent component analysis (ICA) are described. MR acquisition strategies that attempt to either minimize the influence of physiological fluctuations on recorded fMRI data, or provide additional information to correct for their presence, will be mentioned. General advice on modeling noise sources, and its effect on statistical inference via loss of degrees of freedom, and non-orthogonality of regressors, is given.

Using a sliding window analysis on resting state fMRI data from 35 young, healthy male subjects, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) covaries with temporal changes in whole-brain functional connectivity with seed regions previously described to mediate effects of vigilance and arousal (amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; dACC). We identified a set of regions, including brainstem, thalamus, putamen, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, that became more strongly coupled with the dACC and amygdala seeds during states of elevated HRV. Effects differed between high and low frequency components of HRV, suggesting specific contributions of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone on individual connections. Furthermore, dynamics of functional connectivity could be separated from those primarily related to BOLD signal fluctuations.

From a cohort of children arrested before the age of 12 years, participants who were diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder in previous waves (mean age of onset 6.5 years, s.d. 3.2) were reassessed at mean age 17.6 years (s.d. 1.4) and categorized as persistent (n=25) or desistent (n=25) DBD. Using the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory and functional magnetic resonance imaging during a fear conditioning task, these subgroups were compared with 26 matched healthy controls from the same cohort. Both persistent and desistent DBD subgroups were found to show higher activation in fear processing-related brain areas during fear conditioning compared with healthy controls. In addition, regression analyses revealed that impulsive-irresponsible and grandiose-manipulative psychopathic traits were associated with higher activation, whereas callous-unemotional psychopathic traits were related to lower activation in fear-related areas. Finally, the association between neural activation and DBD subgroup membership was mediated by impulsive-irresponsible psychopathic traits.

The anterior cingulate (AC) is activated during ""awareness of mind wandering."" The AC modulates both the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the central locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine systems, which form the principal neuromodulatory system, regulating in multiple ways both neuronal and non-neuronal cells to maximize adaptation in changing environments. The LC is the primary source of central norepinephrine (C-NE) and nearly the exclusive source of cortical norepinephrine. Normally activated by novel or salient stimuli, the AC initially inhibits the SNS reflexively, lowering peripheral norepinephrine and activates the LC, increasing C-NE. Moderate levels of C-NE enhance working memory through alpha 2 adrenergic receptors, while higher levels of C-NE, acting on alpha 1 and beta receptors, enhance other executive network functions such as the stopping of ongoing behavior, attentional set-shifting, and sustained attention. The actions of the AC on both the central and peripheral noradrenergic systems are implicated in the beneficial effects of meditation.

METHODS: A 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in a university research center. Participants were 23 healthy postmenopausal women aged 49 to 55 years. Cognitive performance was assessed with a computerized cognitive battery administered to all participants on 0, 12, and 26 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 13 participants before and after treatment using tasks of verbal fluency and mental rotation.

Epub 2013 May 10.","OBJECT: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) represents an established tool in neurosurgery to increase patient safety. Its application, however, is controversial. Its use has been described as helpful in avoiding neurological deterioration during intracranial aneurysm surgery. Its impact on extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery involving parent artery occlusion for the treatment of complex aneurysms has not yet been studied. The authors therefore sought to evaluate the effects of IONM on patient safety, the surgeon's intraoperative strategies, and functional outcome of patients after cerebral bypass surgery. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring results were compared with those of intraoperative blood flow monitoring to assess bypass graft perfusion. METHODS: Compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) were generated using transcranial electrical stimulation in patients undergoing EC-IC bypass surgery. Preoperative and postoperative motor function was analyzed. To assess graft function, intraoperative flowmetry and indocyanine green fluorescence angiography were performed. Special care was taken to compare the relevance of electrophysiological and blood flow monitoring in the detection of critical intraoperative ischemic episodes. RESULTS: The study included 31 patients with 31 aneurysms and 1 bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid arteries, undergoing 32 EC-IC bypass surgeries in which radial artery or saphenous vein grafts were used. In 11 cases, 15 CMAP events were observed, helping the surgeon to determine the source of deterioration and to react to it: 14 were reversible and only 1 showed no recovery. In all cases, blood flow monitoring showed good perfusion of the bypass grafts. There were no false-negative results in this series. New postoperative motor deficits were transient in 1 case, permanent in 1 case, and not present in all other cases. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is a helpful tool for continuous functional monitoring of patients undergoing large-caliber vessel EC-IC bypass surgery. The authors' results suggest that continuous neurophysiological monitoring during EC-IC bypass surgery has relevant advantages over flow-oriented monitoring techniques such as intraoperative flowmetry or indocyanine green-based angiography.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23662820,N,clinical,,,

We studied 120 healthy subjects in whom the baseline personality and anxiety traits and the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype were measured. Real-time autonomic nervous system parameters and serum cortisol were measured at baseline and after standardised visceral and somatic pain stimuli. Brain processing reactions to visceral pain were studied in 29 subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The reproducibility of the psychophysiological responses to pain was assessed at year. In group analysis, visceral and somatic pain caused an expected increase in sympathetic and cortisol responses and activated the pain matrix according to fMRI studies. However, using cluster analysis, we found 2 reproducible PCs: at baseline, PC1 had higher neuroticism/anxiety scores (P </= 0.01); greater sympathetic tone (P<0.05); and higher cortisol levels (P </= 0.001). During pain, less stimulus was tolerated (P </= 0.01), and there was an increase in parasympathetic tone (P </= 0.05). The 5-HTTLPR short allele was over-represented (P </= 0.005). PC2 had the converse profile at baseline and during pain. Brain activity differed (P </= 0.001); greater activity occurred in the left frontal cortex in PC1, whereas PC2 showed greater activity in the right medial/frontal cortex and right anterior insula.

We investigated the relationship between the behavioural and cardiac response in dogs (N= 30) while being approached by a threatening stranger in separation vs. in the presence of the owner, presented in a balanced order. Non-invasive telemetric measures of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) data during the threatening approaches was compared to periods before and after the encounters. Dogs that showed distress vocalisation during separation (N = 18) and that growled or barked at the stranger during the threatening approach (N = 17) were defined as behaviourally reactive in the given situation. While characteristic stress vocalisations were emitted during separations, the absence of the owner did not have an effect on dogs' mean HR, but significantly increased the HRV. The threatening approach increased dogs' mean HR, with a parallel decrease in the HRV, particularly in dogs that were behaviourally reactive to the encounter. Importantly, the HR increase was significantly less pronounced when dogs faced the stranger in the presence of the owner. Moreover, the test order, whether the dog encountered the stranger first with or without its owner, also proved important: HR increase associated with the encounter in separation seemed to be attenuated in dogs that faced the stranger first in the presence of their owner. We provided evidence for human analogue safe haven effect of the owner in a potentially dangerous situation.

Nevertheless, how the pattern of stimulation affects sensitization and/or desensitization to visceral stimulation remains unknown. METHODS: In 45 nonclinical healthy participants (12 women, 33 men; 20-26 years old), brain processing of visceral sensation induced by colonic distension was examined using H2(15)O positron emission tomography. Subjective feelings regarding the stimuli were also measured. The descending colon was stimulated using six patterns of three bag pressures (0, 20, and 40 mm Hg). To evaluate the neural sensitization to visceral stimulation arising from the precedence effect, the effects of a 20- or 40-mm Hg distention after a sham or 20- or 40-mm Hg distension were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. The level of significance was set at a voxelwise level of p < .0001, with cluster extent sizes of k > 50. RESULTS: The midbrain, insula, and cerebellum, were more strongly activated by a 20-mm Hg distension with a preceding 40-mm Hg distention than by a 20-mm Hg distention without a preceding stimulation (p < .0001).

Short and long-term effects of these drugs on brain physiology remain poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear whether any physiological effect in the brain may be different for FGAs and SGAs. Immediate (+3.30 h) and different effects of single-dose FGA (haloperidol, 3 mg) and a SGA (aripiprazole, 10 mg) on resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were explored in the same 20 healthy volunteers using a pulsed continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) sequence (1.5T) in a placebo-controlled, repeated measures design. Both antipsychotics increased striatal rCBF but the effect was greater after haloperidol. Both decreased frontal rCBF, and opposite effects of the drugs were observed in the temporal cortex (haloperidol decreased, aripiprazole increased rCBF) and in the posterior cingulate (haloperidol increased, aripiprazole decreased rCBF). Further increases were evident in the insula, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate after both antipsychotics, in the motor cortex following haloperidol and in the occipital lobe the claustrum and the cerebellum after aripiprazole. Further decreases were observed in the parietal and occipital cortices after aripiprazole. This study suggests that early and different rCBF changes are evident following a single-dose of FGA and SGA. The effects occur in healthy volunteers, thus may be independent from any underlying pathology, and in the same regions identified as structurally and functionally altered in schizophrenia, suggesting a possible relationship between antipsychotic-induced rCBF changes and brain alterations in schizophrenia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22451196,N,no corr,,,

However, in trace conditioning, the CS and US are separated by a period of time called the trace interval, and thus do not overlap. Therefore, determining brain regions that support associative learning by maintaining a CS representation during the trace interval is an important issue for conditioning research. Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has identified brain regions that support trace-conditioning processes. However, relatively little is known about whether this activity is specific to the trace CS, the trace interval, or both periods of time. The present study was designed to disentangle the hemodynamic response produced by the trace CS from that associated with the trace interval, in order to identify learning-related activation during these distinct components of a trace-conditioning trial. Trace-conditioned activity was observed within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsolateral PFC, insula, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and posterior cingulate (PCC). Each of these regions showed learning-related activity during the trace CS, while trace-interval activity was only observed within a subset of these areas (i.e., dorsomedial PFC, PCC, right dorsolateral PFC, right IPL, right superior/middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral insula). Trace-interval activity was greater in right than in left dorsolateral PFC, IPL, and superior/middle temporal gyrus. These findings indicate that components of the prefrontal, cingulate, insular, and parietal cortices support trace-interval processes, as well as suggesting that a right-lateralized fronto-parietal circuit may play a unique role in trace conditioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23263840,N,no phys of interest,,,

To date, research into mechanisms through which inflammation impacts cardiovascular health rarely takes into account central effects on autonomic cardiovascular control, instead emphasizing direct effects of peripheral inflammatory responses on endothelial reactivity and myocardial function. However, brain responses to inflammation engage neural systems for motivational and homeostatic control and are expressed through depressed mood state and changes in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Here we combined an inflammatory challenge, known to evoke an acute reduction in mood, with neuroimaging to identify the functional brain substrates underlying potentially detrimental changes in autonomic cardiovascular control. We first demonstrated that alterations in the balance of low to high frequency (LF/HF) changes in heart rate variability (a measure of baroreflex sensitivity) could account for some of the inflammation-evoked changes in diastolic blood pressure, indicating a central (rather than solely local endothelial) origin. Accompanying alterations in regional brain metabolism (measured using (18)FDG-PET) were analysed to localise central mechanisms of inflammation-induced changes in cardiovascular state: three discrete regions previously implicated in stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity, the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate and pons, strongly mediated the relationship between inflammation and blood pressure. Moreover, activity changes within each region predicted the inflammation-induced shift in LF/HF balance. These data are consistent with a centrally-driven component originating within brain areas supporting stressor evoked blood pressure reactivity. Together our findings highlight mechanisms binding psychological and physiological well-being and their perturbation by peripheral inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23416033,N,inflammation induced changes,,,

The present pilot study investigates the effects of this novel technique of auricular transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in depressed patients for the first time. A total of 37 patients suffering from major depression were included in two randomized sham controlled add-on studies. Patients were stimulated five times a week on a daily basis for the duration of 2 weeks. On days 0 and 14, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were assessed. In contrast to sham-treated patients, electrically stimulated persons showed a significantly better outcome in the BDI. Mean decrease in the active treatment group was 12.6 (SD 6.0) points compared to 4.4 (SD 9.9) points in the sham group. HAMD score did not change significantly in the two groups. An antidepressant effect of a new transcutaneous auricular nerve stimulation technique has been shown for the first time in this controlled pilot study.

In the present study we measured femoral bone blood flow and glucose uptake in young healthy subjects by positron emission tomography in three separate protocols. In 6 women, blood flow was measured in femoral bone at rest and during one-leg intermittent isometric exercise with increasing exercise intensities. In 9 men, blood flow in the femur was determined at rest and during dynamic one-leg exercise and two other physiological perturbations: moderate systemic hypoxia (14 O2 ) at rest and during exercise, and during intrafemoral infusion of high-dose adenosine. Bone glucose uptake was measured at rest and during dynamic one-leg exercise in 5 men. The results indicate that isometric exercise increased femoral bone blood flow from rest (1.8 +/- 0.6 mL/100 g/min) to low intensity exercise (4.1 +/- 1.5 mL/100 g/min, p = 0.01), but blood flow did not increase further with increasing intensity. Resting femoral bone blood flow in men was similar to that of women and dynamic one-leg exercise increased it to 4.2 +/- 1.2 mL/100 g/min, p < 0.001. Breathing of hypoxic air did not change femoral bone blood flow at rest or during exercise, but intra-arterial infusion of adenosine during resting conditions increased bone blood flow to 5.7 +/- 2.4 mL/100 g/min, to the level of moderate-intensity dynamic exercise. Dynamic one-leg exercise increased femoral bone glucose uptake 4.7-fold compared to resting contralateral leg. In conclusion, resting femoral bone blood flow increases by physical exercise, but appears to level off with increasing exercise intensities. Moreover, although moderate systemic hypoxia does not change bone blood flow at rest or during exercise, intra-arterially administered adenosine during resting conditions is capable of markedly enhancing bone blood flow in humans. Finally, bone glucose uptake also increases substantially in response to exercise.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23280932,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2012 Oct 27.","Animal models of predator defense distinguish qualitatively different behavioral modes that are activated at increasing levels of predation threat. A defense mode observed at intermediate threat levels is freezing: a cessation of locomotion that is characterized by a parasympathetically dominated autonomic nervous system response that causes heart rate deceleration, or fear bradycardia. Studies in rodents have shown that freezing depends on amygdalar projections to the periaqueductal grey (PAG). In humans, freezing-like behaviors are implicated in development and maintenance of psychopathology, but neural mechanisms underlying freezing or its characteristic autonomic response profile have not been identified. Here, we combined event-related blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) with autonomic response measures in a picture viewing paradigm to probe activity and interconnectivity within the amygdala-PAG pathway and test for an association with parasympathetic as opposed to sympathetic activation. In response to negatively arousing pictures, we observed parasympathetic (bradycardia) and sympathetic (pupil dilation) autonomic responses, BOLD responses in the amygdala and PAG, and effective connectivity between these regions. Critically, BOLD responses in the PAG to negative pictures correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with bradycardia but not pupil dilation. This correlation with bradycardia remained significant when partialling out pupil dilation. Additionally, activity in regions associated with motor planning and inhibition mirrored the PAG response. Thus, our findings implicate the human PAG in a parasympathetically dominated defense mode that subserves a state of attentive immobility. Mechanistic insight into this qualitatively distinct defense mode may importantly advance translational models of anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110885,N,PPI,rand,,

FMRI studies of these same subjects have shown leptin-sensitive increases in activation of the right hypothalamus and reduced activation of the cingulate, medial frontal and parahippocampal gryi, following weight loss, in response to food stimuli. In the present study, we expanded our cohort of in-patient subjects and employed psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to examine changes in the functional connectivity of the right hypothalamus. During reduced-weight maintenance with placebo injections, the functional connectivity of the hypothalamus increased with visual areas and the dorsal anterior cingulate (dorsal ACC) in response to food cues, consistent with higher sensitivity to food. During reduced-weight maintenance with leptin injections, however, the functional connectivity of the right hypothalamus increased with the mid-insula and the central and parietal operculae, suggesting increased coupling with the interoceptive system, and decreased with the orbital frontal cortex, frontal pole and the dorsal ACC, suggesting a down-regulated sensitivity to food.

In the current fMRI study, we investigated interactions between reward and threat by investigating the effects of monetary reward on the processing of task-irrelevant threat stimuli during a visual discrimination task. Reward was manipulated by linking fast and accurate responses to foreground stimuli with monetary reward; threat was manipulated by pairing the background context with mild aversive shock. The behavioral results in terms of both accuracy and reaction time revealed that monetary reward eliminated the influence of threat-related stimuli. Paralleling the behavioral results, during trials involving both reward and threat, the imaging data revealed increased engagement of the ventral caudate and anterior mid-cingulate cortex, which were accompanied by increased task-relevant processing in the visual cortex.

The gray matter volume of the dACC was correlated with the duration of disease in migraine patients, and thus we chose this region as the seeding area for resting-state analysis. We found that migraine patients showed increased functional connectivity between several regions and the left dACC, i.e. the bilateral middle temporal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, the functional connectivity between the dACC and two regions (i.e. DLPFC and OFC) was correlated with the duration of disease in migraine patients.

This study used an instructed fear task combined with functional MRI (fMRI) and skin conductance response (SCR) to test hypotheses about mechanisms of disturbed fronto-limbic neural circuitry underlying dysfunctional emotional processing in BPD. METHODS: Female BPD patients and matched control subjects were exposed to two visual stimuli during fMRI scanning and SCR recording. Subjects were instructed shortly before scanning that one stimulus (Threat) potentially represents an aversive event whereas another stimulus (Safe) represents safety. The aversive event (electrodermal stimulation) itself was only experienced before this instruction and never occurred during fMRI scanning. RESULTS: Both groups showed stronger SCR to Threat compared to Safe indicating differential fear response which habituated over time. BPD compared to control subjects did not show fMRI signal decrease of amygdala activity or relative ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity increase over time. Moreover, BPD patients showed increased connectivity of the amygdala with vmPFC but decreased connectivity of subgenual ACC with dorsal ACC compared to control subjects.

To test this, we conducted behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in which two participants simultaneously played a virtual ball-toss game where either the subjects' partner or an unfamiliar player was isolated by the other players. The subjects showed sympathetic behavior by tossing the ball to the isolated player and reported enhancement of self-positive feelings and anticipation of feeling improvements of the isolated player during sympathetic behaviors. Activation in the bilateral dorsal striatum became more prominent during the behaviors, supporting the empathic joy hypothesis. Dorsal striatal activity when helping a romantic partner positively correlated with affective empathic traits toward that partner, whereas the activity measured when helping a stranger positively correlated with perspective-taking traits.

Conflict-related themes should therefore provoke strong reactions on the behavioral, physiological, and neural level. We confronted N = 18 healthy subjects with a vast array of sentences describing typical psychodynamic conflict themes in the fMRI scanner and let them associate spontaneously in reaction. The overt associations were then analyzed according to psychoanalytic theory and the system of operationalized psychodynamic diagnosis and used as a genuinely psychodynamic indicator, whether each potentially conflict-related sentence actually touched a conflict theme of the individual. Behavioral, physiological, and neural reactions were compared between those subjects with an ""apparent conflict"" and those with ""absent conflicts."" The first group reported stronger agreement with the conflict-related sentences, more negative valence in reaction, had higher levels of skin conductance reactivity and exhibited stronger activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, amongst other functions involved in emotion processing and conflict-monitoring. In conjunction, we interpret this activity as a possible correlate of subjects' inherent reactions and regulatory processes evoked by conflict themes. This study makes a point for the fruitfulness of the neuropsychoanalytic endeavor by using free association, the classical technique most commonly used in psychoanalysis, to investigate aspects of conflict processing in neuroimaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298244,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2012 Sep 25.","Growing interest in pharmacological resting state fMRI (RSfMRI) necessitates developing standardized and robust analytical approaches that are insensitive to spurious correlated physiological signals. However, in pharmacological experiments physiological variations constitute an important aspect of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profile of drug action; therefore retrospective corrective methods that discard physiological signals as noise may not be suitable. Previously, we have shown that template-based dual regression analysis is a sensitive method for model-free and objective detection of drug-specific effects on functional brain connectivity. In the current study, the robustness of this standard approach to physiological variations in a placebo controlled, repeated measures pharmacological RSfMRI study of morphine and alcohol in 12 healthy young men is tested. The impact of physiology-related variations on statistical inferences has been studied by: 1) modeling average physiological rates in higher level group analysis; 2) Regressing out the instantaneous respiration variation (RV); 3) applying retrospective image correction (RETROICOR) in the preprocessing stage; and 4) performing combined RV and heart rate correction (RVHRCOR) by regressing out physiological pulses convolved with canonical respiratory and cardiac hemodynamic response functions. Results indicate regional sensitivity of the BOLD signal to physiological variations, especially in the vicinity of large vessels, plus certain brain structures that are reported to be involved in physiological regulation, such as posterior cingulate, precuneus, medial prefrontal and insular cortices, as well as the thalamus, cerebellum and the brainstem. The largest impact of ""correction"" on final statistical test outcomes resulted from including the average respiration frequency and heart rate in the higher-level group analysis. Overall, the template-based dual regression method seems robust against physical noise that is corrected by RV regression or RETROICOR. However, convolving the RV and HR with canonical hemodynamic response functions caused a notable change in the BOLD signal variance, and in resting state connectivity estimates. The impact of RVHRCOR on statistical tests was limited to elimination of both morphine and alcohol effects related to the somatosensory network that consists of insula and cingulate cortex-important structures for autonomic regulation. Although our data do not warrant speculations about neuronal or vascular origins of these effects, these observations raise caution about the implications of physiological 'noise' and the risks of introducing false positives (e.g. increased white matter connectivity) by using generalized physiological correction methods in pharmacological studies. The obvious sensitivity of the posterior part of the default mode network to different correction schemes, underlines the importance of controlling for physiological fluctuations in seed-based functional connectivity analyses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022093,N,methods paper,,,

However, evoked-pain connectivity studies have employed cutaneous and/or brief stimuli, which induce sensations that differ appreciably from the clinical pain experience. Sustained myofascial pain evoked by pressure cuff affords an excellent opportunity to evaluate functional connectivity change to more clinically relevant sustained deep-tissue pain. Connectivity in specific networks known to be modulated by evoked pain (sensorimotor, salience, dorsal attention, frontoparietal control, and default mode networks: SMN, SLN, DAN, FCN, and DMN) was evaluated with functional-connectivity magnetic resonance imaging, both at rest and during a sustained (6-minute) pain state in healthy adults. We found that pain was stable, with no significant changes of subjects' pain ratings over the stimulation period. Sustained pain reduced connectivity between the SMN and the contralateral leg primary sensorimotor (S1/M1) representation. Such SMN-S1/M1 connectivity decreases were also accompanied by and correlated with increased SLN-S1/M1 connectivity, suggesting recruitment of activated S1/M1 from SMN to SLN. Sustained pain also increased DAN connectivity to pain processing regions such as mid-cingulate cortex, posterior insula, and putamen. Moreover, greater connectivity during pain between contralateral S1/M1 and posterior insula, thalamus, putamen, and amygdala was associated with lower cuff pressures needed to reach the targeted pain sensation. These results demonstrate that sustained pain disrupts resting S1/M1 connectivity by shifting it to a network known to process stimulus salience. Furthermore, increased connectivity between S1/M1 and both sensory and affective processing areas may be an important contribution to interindividual differences in pain sensitivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23718988,N,no phys of interest,,,

We hypothesized that increases in MSNA evoked by these simulated apneas are accompanied by BOLD contrast changes in the insular cortex, thalamus and limbic cortex. A series of 150 whole-brain images were collected during 3 randomly performed 16-second end-expiratory BHs and MMs (-30 mmHg).

The time course of the sympathoexcitatory response to both breathing tasks were correlated with whole-brain BOLD signal changes. Brain sites demonstrating both positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) correlations with the MSNA time course were identified.

Moreover, because disgust sensitivity (DS) is considered as a relevant factor for learning processes, this study also investigated the potential relationship between DS and disgust extinction learning. The aim of this study was to explore the neuronal correlates of disgust extinction, as well as changes in skin conductance responses (SCRs) and evaluative conditioning. Twenty subjects were exposed to a differential extinction paradigm, in which a previous conditioned, and now unreinforced, stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was compared to a second stimulus (CS-), which was previously not associated with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Extinction learning was measured on three different response levels (BOLD responses, SCRs, and evaluative conditioning). Regarding evaluative conditioning, the CS+ was rated as more unpleasant than the CS-. Interestingly, significantly increased amygdala responses and SCRs toward to the CS- were observed. Finally, a (negative) trend was found between DS scores and BOLD responses of the prefrontal cortex. The present findings showed a dissociation of different response levels. The increased CS- responses could be explained by the assumption that the increased amygdala activity may reflect a safety learning signal during the first extinction trials and the subjective focus may therefore shift from the CS+ to the CS-. The correlation finding supports previous studies postulating that DS hampers extinction processes. The present results point toward dissociations between the response levels in context of extinction processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23731074,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2012 Apr 16.","BACKGROUND: Current models suggest that a variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) is associated with altered amygdala reactivity not only towards negative but also towards positive stimuli, which has been neglected in the past. This association may possibly convey an elevated vulnerability for psychopathology like abuse, craving, and relapses. Since appetitive conditioning is a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of these psychiatric disorders, the identification of specific factors contributing to interindividual variation is important. METHODS: In the present study (N = 86), an appetitive conditioning paradigm was conducted, in which a neutral stimulus (CS+) was associated with appetitive stimuli, while a second stimulus (CS-) predicted their absence. Subjects were genotyped according to the 5-HTTLPR genotype. RESULTS: As the main result, we report a significant association between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and hemodynamic responses. Individuals with the s-allele displayed elevated conditioned bilateral amygdala activity in contrast to l/l-allele carriers. Further, increased hemodynamic responses in s-allele carriers were also found in the extended emotional network including the orbitofrontal cortex, the thalamus, and the ventral striatum. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate an association of the 5-HTTLPR and altered conditioned responses in appetitive conditioning. Further, the findings contribute to the ongoing debate on 5-HTTLPR dependent hemodynamic response patterns by emphasizing that s-allele carriers are not exclusively biased towards fearful, but also towards positive stimuli. In conclusion, our results imply that s-allele carriers might be better described as hyper-reactive towards salient stimuli, which may convey vulnerability for the development of psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22505321,N,no phys of interest,,,

Various therapeutic techniques in the treatment of facet-related pain have been described in the literature, including intraarticular lumbar facet joint steroid injections and radiofrequency denervation. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of intraarticular facet joint steroid injections and radiofrequency denervation. METHODS: Our randomized, double-blind, controlled study included patients who received intraarticular steroid infiltrations in the lumbar facet joints (L3/L4-L5/S1) and patients who underwent radiofrequency denervation of L3/L4-L5/S1 segments. The inclusion criteria were based first on magnetic resonance imaging findings showing hypertrophy of the facet joints L3/L4-L5/S1 and a positive response to an intraarticular test infiltration of the facet joints L3/L4-L5/S1 with local anesthetics. The primary end point was the Roland-Morris Questionnaire. Secondary end points were the visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index. All outcome assessments were performed at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were randomized; 24 of 29 patients in the steroid injection group and 26 of 27 patients in the denervation group completed the 6-month follow-up.

In the ""relative relief context,"" moderate pain represented the best outcome, since the alternative outcome was intense pain. However, in the control context, moderate pain represented the worst outcome and elicited negative hedonic feelings. The context manipulation resulted in a ""hedonic flip,"" such that moderate pain elicited positive hedonics in the relative relief context.

This ""hedonic flip"" was corroborated by physiological and functional neuroimaging data. When moderate pain was perceived as pleasant, skin conductance and activity in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate were significantly attenuated relative to the control moderate stimulus. ""Pleasant pain"" also increased activity in reward and valuation circuitry, including the medial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Furthermore, the change in outcome hedonics correlated with activity in the periacqueductal grey (PAG) of the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS).

METHODS: Ten volunteers were enrolled in the study. We performed ultrasound-guided single-shot paravertebral blocks with 20 ml mepivacaine 1% at the thoracic six level at both sides on two consecutive days. After each paravertebral blockade, a magnetic resonance imaging investigation was performed to investigate the three-dimensional spread of the LA. In addition, sensory spread of blockade was evaluated via pinprick testing. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) cranial and caudal distribution of the LA relative to the thoracic six puncture level was 1.0 (2.5) and 3.0 (0.75) [=4.0 vertebral levels] for the left and 0.5 (1.0) and 3.0 (0.75) [=3.5 vertebral levels] for the right side. Accordingly, the LA distributed more caudally than cranially. The median (interquartile range) number of sensory dermatomes which were affected by the thoracic paravertebral blockade was 9.8 (6.5) for the left and 10.7 (8.8) for the right side. The sensory distribution of thoracic paravertebral blockade was significantly larger compared with the spread of LA. CONCLUSIONS: Although the spread of LA was reproducible, the anesthetic effect was unpredictable, even with a standardized ultrasound-guided technique in volunteers. While it can be assumed that approximately 4 vertebral levels are covered by 20 ml LA, the somatic distribution of the thoracic paravertebral blockade remains unpredictable. In a significant percentage, the LA distributes into the epidural space, prevertebral, or to the contralateral side.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23442752,N,pharma study,,,

The methodology has been described here. Test centres were located in Manchester, UK; Paris, France; Leiden, The Netherlands; Tartu, Estonia and Jyvaskyla, Finland. In total, 182 young (18-30 years old, 52.2 % female) and 322 older adults (69-81 years old, 50 % female) have been examined. The participants were independent living, socially active and free from disease that impaired mobility levels. The older participants were selected based on physical activity levels, such that half exceeded current recommended physical activity levels and the other half had lower physical activity levels than is recommended to maintain health. Measurements consisted of blood pressure; anthropometry and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging); lung function; standing balance and cognitive function (CANTAB). Mobility was assessed using the Timed Up and Go, a 6 min walk, activity questionnaires and accelerometers to monitor habitual daily activities. Muscle strength, power, fatigue and neural activation were assessed using a combination of voluntary and electrically stimulated contractions. Fasting blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies were collected for detailed examination of cell and molecular differences between young and older individuals. The results from this study will provide a detailed insight into ""normal, healthy"" ageing, linking whole-body function to the structure and function of the neuromuscular system and the molecular characteristics of skeletal muscle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722256,N,no brain data,,,

In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we tested whether a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) compared to a control condition influenced subsequent fear conditioning in 48 men and 48 women taking oral contraceptives (OCs). One of two pictures of a geometrical figure was always paired (conditioned stimulus, CS+) or never paired (CS-) with an electrical stimulation (unconditioned stimulus). BOLD responses as well as skin conductance responses were assessed. Sex-independently, stress enhanced the CS+/CS- differentiation in the hippocampus in early acquisition but attenuated conditioned responses in the medial frontal cortex in late acquisition. In early acquisition, stress reduced the CS+/CS- differentiation in the nucleus accumbens in men, but enhanced it in OC women. In late acquisition, the same pattern (reduction in men, enhancement in OC women) was found in the amygdala as well as in the anterior cingulate. Thus, psychosocial stress impaired the neuronal correlates of fear learning and expression in men, but facilitated them in OC women. A sex-specific modulation of fear conditioning after stress might contribute to the divergent prevalence of men and women in developing psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23790683,N,no corr,,,

Additionally, during cortical stimulation TMJ movements and swallowing show a high overlap of representational areas in the primary motor cortex. It has thus been hypothesized that they overall might share the same neural structures. To differentiate these two movements, we performed a functional MRI (fMRI) study that enabled a direct comparison of functional representation of both actions in the same subject group. Effort during these tasks was controlled by skin conductance response. When balancing effort, we found a comparable neural representation pattern for both tasks but increased resources necessary to perform swallowing in direct comparison between tasks. For the first time, with the usage of fMRI, we demonstrated a representation in the brainstem for swallowing and occlusion. Increased activation for swallowing was observed in bilateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor and supplementary motor cortex, motor cingulate, thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, left pallidum, bilateral pons, and midbrain. Peaks of activation in primary motor cortex between both conditions were about 5 mm adjacent. Brainstem activation was found corresponding to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the solitary nucleus for swallowing, and the trigeminal nucleus for occlusion. Our data suggest that cerebral representation of occlusion and swallowing are spatially widely overlapping, differing predominantly with respect to the quantity of neural resources involved. Both brainstem and primary motor representation differ in location with respect to somatotopy and contribution of cranial nerve nuclei.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23494122,N,no corr,,,

Elevated fear and anxiety are common characteristics of this disorder. The neurobiology of fear regulation and consolidation of safety memories have not been examined in this patient population. OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychophysiological and neurobiological correlates of conditioned fear extinction in patients with OCD. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one patients with OCD and 21 healthy participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Skin conductance responses and blood oxygenation level-dependent responses. RESULTS: The between-group difference noted in our psychophysiological measure (skin conductance responses) was during extinction recall: patients with OCD showed impaired extinction recall relative to control subjects. Regarding the functional magnetic resonance imaging data, patients with OCD showed significantly reduced activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex across training phases. Moreover, reduced activation in the patients with OCD was noted in the caudate and hippocampus during fear conditioning, as well as in the cerebellum, posterior cingulate cortex, and putamen during extinction recall. Contrary to our prediction, OCD symptom severity was positively correlated with the magnitude of extinction memory recall. Also contrary to our prediction, functional responses of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex were positively correlated with symptom severity, and functional responses of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were inversely correlated with symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: As expected, our study showed that fear extinction and its neural substrates are impaired in patients with OCD. However, this study also yielded some surprising and unexpected results regarding the correlates between extinction capacity and its neural substrates and the severity of symptoms expressed in this disorder. Thus, our data report neural correlates of deficient fear extinction in patients with OCD. The negative correlations between fear extinction deficits and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale symptoms in OCD suggest that there may be other factors, in addition to fear extinction deficiency, that contribute to the psychopathology of OCD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740049,N,no corr,,,

Indeed, functional neuroimaging studies have shown the activation of specific brain structures, the brainstem in migraine and posterior hypothalamus in cluster headache (CH), as well as in other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. We describe the functional neuroimaging findings in a patient suffering from CH headache, investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during typical pain attacks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two typical, consecutive CH attacks were investigated by two fMRI imaging sessions on the same day. Both fMRI scans were performed at rest, during the CH attacks and the pain-free state induced by subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan. RESULTS: Significant activation of the bilateral red nucleus, ventral pons and trigeminal root entry zone ipsilaterally to the pain side was detected during the pain state, in addition to the hypothalamic region ipsilaterally to the pain side. CONCLUSION: Being that such structures are mainly involved in motor function and reactive behaviour, their activation, in our hypothesis, may be linked to pain avoidance and may well represent a defence reaction in cluster headache, which is characterised by a ""fight-or-flight"" type behavioural pattern during pain attacks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23359873,N,no phys of interest,,,

Prior studies have revealed that sympathetic arousal increases, particularly at the beginning of the examination. Against this background it appears likely that those stress reactions during the scanning procedure may influence task performance and neural correlates. However, the question how sympathetic arousal elicited by the scanning procedure itself may act as a potential confounder of fMRI data remains unresolved today. Thirty-seven scanner naive healthy subjects performed a simple cued target detection task. Levels of salivary alpha amylase (sAA), as a biomarker for sympathetic activity, were assessed in samples obtained at several time points during the lab visit. SAA increased two times, immediately prior to scanning and at the end of the scanning procedure. Neural activation related to motor preparation and timing as well as task performance was positively correlated with the first increase. Furthermore, the first sAA increase was associated with task induced deactivation (TID) in frontal and parietal regions. However, these effects were restricted to the first part of the experiment. Consequently, this bias of scanner related sympathetic activation should be considered in future fMRI investigations. It is of particular importance for pharmacological investigations studying adrenergic agents and the comparison of groups with different stress vulnerabilities like patients and controls or adolescents and adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23967320,N,no phys of interest,,,

Each subject was scanned in two separate days in counterbalanced order: one with the MIST and one with the control task. Binding potential (BP ND ) maps of the whole brain were calculated for each scan, using a simplified reference tissue compartmental model. Then BP ND was compared between subjects. Heart rate, galvanic skin response, and salivary cortisol level were measured during the scans. RESULTS: The psychological stressor significantly decreased [(18)F]fallypride binding values in the dorsal part of the medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), corresponding to the rostal part of the cingulate motor zone. The greater the stress-induced decrease in [(18)F]fallypride binding in the dmPFC, the greater the stress-induced increases in heart rate.

Epub 2012 Apr 14.","Autonomic nervous system (ANS) response to acupuncture has been investigated by multiple studies; however, the brain circuitry underlying this response is not well understood. We applied event-related fMRI (er-fMRI) in conjunction with ANS recording (heart rate, HR; skin conductance response, SCR). Brief manual acupuncture stimuli were delivered at acupoints ST36 and SP9, while sham stimuli were delivered at control location, SH1. Acupuncture produced activation in S2, insula, and mid-cingulate cortex, and deactivation in default mode network (DMN) areas. On average, HR deceleration (HR-) and SCR were noted following both real and sham acupuncture, though magnitude of response was greater following real acupuncture and inter-subject magnitude of response correlated with evoked sensation intensity. Acupuncture events with strong SCR also produced greater anterior insula activation than without SCR. Moreover, acupuncture at SP9, which produced greater SCR, also produced stronger sharp pain sensation, and greater anterior insula activation. Conversely, acupuncture-induced HR- was associated with greater DMN deactivation. Between-event correlation demonstrated that this association was strongest for ST36, which also produced more robust HR-. In fact, DMN deactivation was significantly more pronounced across acupuncture stimuli producing HR-, versus those events characterized by acceleration (HR+). Thus, differential brain response underlying acupuncture stimuli may be related to differential autonomic outflows and may result from heterogeneity in evoked sensations. Our er-fMRI approach suggests that ANS response to acupuncture, consistent with previously characterized orienting and startle/defense responses, arises from activity within distinct subregions of the more general brain circuitry responding to acupuncture stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504841,M,acupuncture,,,

Primary analyses were performed on 29 individuals (18 males) ranging from 21 to 80 years of age, who produced a HR response >3bpm to an isometric handgrip (IHG) task. HR and cortical activity were recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging with blood oxygen level-dependent contrast. The average change in HR from baseline was 6bpm +/-2. Activity in the MPFC and left HC was reduced relative to baseline in all subjects when correlated with the HR time course. Measures of connectivity demonstrated that the MPFC engaged in significantly stronger functional connectivity to the left HC during a 40% IHG task. Effective connectivity revealed a directionality of influence from the MPFC to the left HC. A second group (n=15) of individuals without a HR response (~1bpm) to IHG were studied post-hoc and these individuals showed no deactivation in either the MPFC or left HC.

Our specific application requires synchronizing an external patient motion-tracking system with a medical imaging system by multiplexing the tracking input with the ECG input. The authors believe that their methodology can be adapted for use in a variety of medical imaging modalities including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: The authors insert a unique pulse sequence into a single physiological input channel. This sequence is then recorded in the list-mode acquisition along with the R-wave pulse used for ECG gating. The specific form of our pulse sequence allows for recognition of the time point being synchronized even when portions of the pulse sequence are lost due to collisions with R-wave pulses. This was achieved by altering our software used in binning the list-mode data to recognize even a portion of our pulse sequence. Limitations on heart rates at which our pulse sequence could be reliably detected were investigated by simulating the mixing of the two signals as a function of heart rate and time point during the cardiac cycle at which our pulse sequence is mixed with the cardiac signal. RESULTS: The authors have successfully achieved accurate temporal synchronization of our motion-tracking system with acquisition of SPECT projections used in 17 recent clinical research cases. In our simulation analysis the authors determined that synchronization to enable compensation for body and respiratory motion could be achieved for heart rates up to 125 beats-per-minute (bpm). CONCLUSIONS: Synchronization of list-mode acquisition with external patient monitoring devices such as those employed in motion-tracking can reliably be achieved using a simple method that can be implemented using minimal external hardware and software modification through a single input channel, while still recording cardiac gating signals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24320538,N,SPECT,,,

RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, BD patients performed significantly worse during the episodic memory task. The results further indicate that verbal episodic memory deficits in BD are associated with abnormal functional activity patterns in frontal, occipital and limbic regions, and an increase in stress parameters. LIMITATIONS: We aimed to minimise sample heterogeneity by setting clear criteria for remission, based on the scores of a depression (BDI II) and mania scale (BRMAS) and on the DSM IV criteria.

In line with this hypothesis, the present study tested whether sympathetic activity shows an association with a tonic dimension of decision-making, exploratory tendency represented by entropy in information theory, and further examined the neural mechanisms of the association. Twenty participants performed a stochastic reversal learning task that required decision-making in an unstable and uncertain situation. Regional cerebral blood flow was evaluated using (15)O-water positron emission tomography (PET), and cardiovascular indices and concentrations of catecholamine in peripheral blood were also measured, during the task. In reversal learning, increased epinephrine during the task positively correlated with larger entropy, indicating a greater tendency for exploration in decision-making. The increase of epinephrine also correlated with brain activity revealed by PET in the somatosensory cortices, anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsal pons. This result is consistent with previously reported brain matrixes of representation of bodily states and interoception. In addition, activity of the anterior insula specifically correlated with entropy, suggesting possible mediation of this brain region between peripheral sympathetic arousal and exploration in decision-making.

A significantly longer latency of BOLD signal changes following Petco2 fluctuations was found in the eyes closed condition compared to with eyes open, which may reveal different intrinsic vascular response delays in CO2 reactivity or an alteration in the net BOLD signal arising from Petco2 fluctuations and altered neural activity with eyes closed. By allowing a spatially varying time delay for the compensation of this temporal difference, a more spatially consistent CO2 correlation map can be obtained. Finally, Granger-causality analysis demonstrated a ""causal"" relationship between Petco2 and BOLD.

Fifteen healthy volunteers (mean +/- SD: age, 26 +/- 5 year; body mass, 79 +/- 10 kg; height, 174 +/- 9 cm) completed 5 minutes of 20 and 40 mm Hg LBPP, in a randomized order, separated by 5 minutes rest (baseline). Beat-to-beat MCAv and blood pressure, partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PET CO2 ) and heart rate were recorded and presented as the change from the preceding baseline. All measures were similar between baseline periods (all P>0.30). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased by 7 +/- 6 (8 +/- 7%) and 13 +/- 7 mm Hg (19 +/- 11%) from baseline during 20 and 40 mm Hg (P<0.01), respectively. The greater MAP increase at 40 mm Hg (P<0.01 versus 20 mm Hg) was mediated via a greater increase in total peripheral resistance (P<0.01), with heart rate, cardiac output (Model flow) and PET CO2 remaining unchanged (all P>0.05) throughout. MCAv increased from baseline by 3 +/- 4 cm s(-1) (5 +/- 5%) during 20 mm Hg (P = 0.003), whilst no change (P = 0.18) was observed during 40 mm Hg. Our results indicate a divergent response, in that 20 mm Hg LBPP-induced modest increases in both MCAv and MAP, yet no change in MCAv was observed at the higher LBPP of 40 mm Hg despite a further increase in MAP.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23701382,N,no brain data,,,

The specific function of the latter two regions during emotional actions is still under debate. The current study investigated brain responses during imitation of positive in comparison to non-emotional facial expressions. Differences in brain activation of the amygdala and insula were additionally examined during observation and execution of facial expressions. Participants imitated, executed and observed happy and non-emotional facial expressions, as well as neutral faces. During imitation, higher right hemispheric activation emerged in the happy compared to the non-emotional condition in the right anterior insula and the right amygdala, in addition to the pre-supplementary motor area, middle temporal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that the right insula was more strongly recruited by (i) imitation and execution than by observation of facial expressions, that (ii) the insula was significantly stronger activated by happy than by non-emotional facial expressions during observation and imitation and that (iii) the activation differences in the right amygdala between happy and non-emotional facial expressions were increased during imitation and execution, in comparison to sole observation. We suggest that the insula and the amygdala contribute specifically to the happy emotional connotation of the facial expressions depending on the task. The pattern of the insula activity might reflect increased bodily awareness during active execution compared to passive observation and during visual processing of the happy compared to non-emotional facial expressions. The activation specific for the happy facial expression of the amygdala during motor tasks, but not in the observation condition, might reflect increased autonomic activity or feedback from facial muscles to the amygdala.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990890,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2013 Jan 31.","Hypersexuality with compulsive sexual behaviour is a significant source of morbidity for patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopamine replacement therapies. We know relatively little about the pathophysiology of hypersexuality in Parkinson's disease, and it is unknown how visual sexual stimuli, similar to the portrayals of sexuality in the mainstream mass media may affect the brain and behaviour in such susceptible individuals. Here, we have studied a group of 12 patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality using a functional magnetic resonance imaging block design exposing participants to both sexual, other reward-related and neutral visual cues. We hypothesized that exposure to visual sexual cues would trigger increased sexual desire in patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality that would correspond to changes in brain activity in regions linked to dopaminergically stimulated sexual motivation. Patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality were scanned ON and OFF dopamine drugs, and their results were compared with a group of 12 Parkinson's disease control patients without hypersexuality or other impulse control disorders. Exposure to sexual cues significantly increased sexual desire and hedonic responses in the Parkinson's disease hypersexuality group compared with the Parkinson's disease control patients. These behavioural changes corresponded to significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes in regions within limbic, paralimbic, temporal, occipital, somatosensory and prefrontal cortices that correspond to emotional, cognitive, autonomic, visual and motivational processes. The functional imaging data showed that the hypersexuality patients' increased sexual desire correlated with enhanced activations in the ventral striatum, and cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. When the patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality were OFF medication, the functional imaging data showed decreases in activation during the presentation of sexual cues relative to rest. These deactivations were not observed when the patients were ON medication, suggesting that dopamine drugs may release inhibition within local neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex that may contribute to compulsive sexual behaviour. The findings of this study have implications with respect to the potential influence of cue exposure via exposure to mass media in enhancing libido, which in this group of vulnerable patients can lead to devastating social consequences and occasionally, custodial sentences. Stimulation through exposure to sexual visual cues in patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality provides a motivational impetus for seeking this reward behaviour through activations and deactivations of cerebral cortex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378222,N,no phys of interest,,,

Much less studied is the possibility of a similar distinction operating at the level of Pavlovian conditioning. In the present study, we scanned human participants while they participated in a Pavlovian conditioning task with a simple structure while measuring activity in the human amygdala using a high-resolution fMRI protocol. After fitting a model-based algorithm and a variety of model-free algorithms to the fMRI data, we found evidence for the superiority of a model-based algorithm in accounting for activity in the amygdala compared to the model-free counterparts. These findings support an important role for model-based algorithms in describing the processes underpinning Pavlovian conditioning, as well as providing evidence of a role for the human amygdala in model-based inference.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23436990,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2012 Aug 16.","BACKGROUND: Distorted images of the observable self are considered crucial in the development and maintenance of social anxiety. We generated an experimental situation in which participants viewed themselves from an observer's perspective when exposed to scrutiny and evaluation by others. Method Twenty patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 20 control subjects were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the public exposure of pre-recorded videos in which they were each shown performing a verbal task. The examiners acted as the audience in the experiment and rated performance. Whole-brain functional maps were computed using Statistical Parametric Mapping. RESULTS: Robust activation was observed in regions related to self-face recognition, emotional response and general arousal in both study groups. Patients showed significantly greater activation only in the primary visual cortex. By contrast, they showed significant deactivation or smaller activation in dorsal frontoparietal and anterior cingulate cortices relevant to the cognitive control of negative emotion. Task-related anxiety ratings revealed a pattern of negative correlation with activation in this frontoparietal/cingulate network. Importantly, the relationship between social anxiety scores and neural response showed an inverted-U function with positive correlations in the lower score range and negative correlations in the higher range. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that exposure to scrutiny and evaluation in SAD may be associated with changes in cortical systems mediating the cognitive components of anxiety. Disorder severity seems to be relevant in shaping the neural response pattern, which is distinctively characterized by a reduced cortical response in the most severe cases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895096,N,no corr,,,

A hallmark complaint of subjects with Gulf War Illness is post-exertional malaise; defined as an exacerbation of symptoms following physical and/or mental effort. To study the causal relationship between exercise, the brain, and changes in symptoms, 28 Gulf War veterans and 10 controls completed an fMRI scan before and after two exercise stress tests to investigate serial changes in pain, autonomic function, and working memory. Exercise induced two clinical Gulf War Illness subgroups. One subgroup presented with orthostatic tachycardia (n = 10). This phenotype correlated with brainstem atrophy, baseline working memory compensation in the cerebellar vermis, and subsequent loss of compensation after exercise. The other subgroup developed exercise induced hyperalgesia (n = 18) that was associated with cortical atrophy and baseline working memory compensation in the basal ganglia. Alterations in cognition, brain structure, and symptoms were absent in controls.

Epub 2013 Sep 16.","Abnormal autonomic function is common in pediatric diseases. Assessment of central mechanisms underlying autonomic challenges may reveal vulnerabilities antecedent to system failure. Our objective was to characterize central markers and physiological responses to a cold pressor challenge in normal children as a critical step for establishing such screening. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and collected physiological measures during cold application to the foot in 24 healthy adolescents (15.5 +/- 0.4 years, 13 male). The protocol included a 120-sec baseline, 120-sec right-foot cold water immersion (4 degrees C), and 120-sec recovery. Analyses included heart rate (HR) cross-correlations with fMRI signals. Cold application increased HR 13% 5-7 sec after onset, which remained elevated throughout the challenge. Respiratory rate transiently increased (peak 22%), then declined (nadir 12% below baseline), before normalizing at 75 sec. Cold onset rapidly increased somatosensory cortex and medullary signals, which fell after 25 sec. Right anterior insular cortex signals increased early, followed after 20 sec by the left anterior insula, with HR declining 8 sec later. Amygdalae signals also rose, but signals declined in the posterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Declining signals appeared late in the cerebellar fastigial nuclei (60-120 sec), and in the pons and thalamus. Somatosensory cortex, fastigial nuclei, and hypothalamic responses were principally left-sided, with bilateral responses elsewhere. Late left anterior insula responses likely underlie the HR decline; the late cerebellar pattern may modulate recovery. The laterality, timing, and amplitude of normative responses and rostral response differentiation indicate the complex integration of adolescent autonomic processing and provide indices for pathological comparisons.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24105663,N,no coords,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for Abeta deposition in cognitively healthy middle-aged and older adults. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals with a vascular risk factor such as hypertension, in combination with a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele), would show greater amyloid burden than those without such risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighteen well-screened and cognitively normal adults, aged 47 to 89 years. Participants were classified in the hypertension group if they reported a medical diagnosis of hypertension or if blood pressure exceeded 140 mm Hg systolic/90 mm Hg diastolic, as measured across 7 occasions at the time of study. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent Abeta positron emission tomography imaging with radiotracer fluorine 18-labeled florbetapir. Participants were genotyped for apolipoprotein E and were classified as epsilon4(+) or epsilon4(-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Amyloid burden. RESULTS: Participants in the hypertension group with at least 1 epsilon4 allele showed significantly greater amyloid burden than those with only 1 risk factor or no risk factors. Furthermore, increased pulse pressure was strongly associated with increased mean cortical amyloid level for subjects with at least 1 epsilon4 allele.

Various donor nerves can be used. If a nerve supply other than the facial nerve is used, the patient has to adapt to generate a smile. If branches of the fifth cranial nerve are used, the patient has to learn to clench teeth and smile. Currently, controversy exists regarding whether a patient develops a spontaneous smile if a nerve other than the facial nerve is used. The authors postulate that brain adaptation in facial palsy patients can occur because of neural plasticity. The authors aimed to determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging could topographically differentiate activity between the facial nerve- and the trigeminal nerve-related cortical areas. METHODS: A new paradigm of study using functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygen level-dependent signal activation was tested on 15 voluntary healthy subjects to find a sensitive localizer for teeth clenching and smiling. Subjects smiled to stimulate the facial nerve-related cortex, clenched their jaws to stimulate the trigeminal nerve-related cortex, and tapped their finger as a control condition. RESULTS: Smiling and teeth clenching showed distinct and consistent areas of cortical activation. Trigeminal and facial motor cortex areas were found to be distinct areas with minimal overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: The authors successfully devised a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm effective for activating specific areas corresponding to teeth clenching and smiling.

Because of its relevance to evolutionary biology, this phenomenon has been the focus of recent investigations in non-human species. In line with the empathic hypothesis, contagious yawning has been shown to correlate with the level of social attachment in several primate species. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have also shown the ability to yawn contagiously. To date, however, the social modulation of dog contagious yawning has received contradictory support and alternative explanations (i.e., yawn as a mild distress response) could explain positive evidence. The present study aims to replicate contagious yawning in dogs and to discriminate between the two possible mediating mechanisms (i.e., empathic vs. distress related response). Twenty-five dogs observed familiar (dog's owner) and unfamiliar human models (experimenter) acting out a yawn or control mouth movements. Concurrent physiological measures (heart rate) were additionally monitored for twenty-one of the subjects. The occurrence of yawn contagion was significantly higher during the yawning condition than during the control mouth movements. Furthermore, the dogs yawned more frequently when watching the familiar model than the unfamiliar one demonstrating that the contagiousness of yawning in dogs correlated with the level of emotional proximity. Moreover, subjects' heart rate did not differ among conditions suggesting that the phenomenon of contagious yawning in dogs is unrelated to stressful events. Our findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning is modulated by affective components of the behavior and may indicate that rudimentary forms of empathy could be present in domesticated dogs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23951146,N,animals,,,

Experiencing humor not only encourages social interactions, but also produces positive physiological effects on the human body, such as lowering blood pressure. Recent neuro-imaging studies have shown evidence for distinct mental state changes at work in people experiencing humor. However, the temporal characteristics of these changes remain elusive. In this paper, we objectively measured humor-related mental states from single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained while subjects viewed comedy TV programs. Measured fMRI data were labeled on the basis of the lag before or after the viewer's perception of humor (humor onset) determined by the viewer-reported humor experiences during the fMRI scans. We trained multiple binary classifiers, or decoders, to distinguish between fMRI data obtained at each lag from ones obtained during a neutral state in which subjects were not experiencing humor. As a result, in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right temporal area, the decoders showed significant classification accuracies even at two seconds ahead of the humor onsets. Furthermore, given a time series of fMRI data obtained during movie viewing, we found that the decoders with significant performance were also able to predict the upcoming humor events on a volume-by-volume basis. Taking into account the hemodynamic delay, our results suggest that the upcoming humor events are encoded in specific brain areas up to about five seconds before the awareness of experiencing humor. Our results provide evidence that there exists a mental state lasting for a few seconds before actual humor perception, as if a viewer is expecting the future humorous events.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324656,N,no phys of interest,,,

Despite initial interest in the use of phospholipids (PLs) for ARCD, in recent years there has been a hiatus in such research. Because of safety concerns regarding PLs derived from bovine cortex, and the equivocal efficacy of soybean-derived PLs, there is an important need for the development of new PL alternatives. Phospholipids derived from milk proteins represent one potential candidate treatment.

Participants will undergo testing at baseline, 90 days and 180 days. The primary outcome is a composite memory score from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive (verbal learning, working memory, prospective and retrospective memory, processing speed and attention), mood (depression, anxiety, stress and visual analogue scales), cardiovascular (blood pressure, blood velocity and pulse wave pressure), gastrointestinal microbiota and biochemical measures (oxidative stress, inflammation, B vitamins and Homocysteine, glucoregulation and serum choline).

Stress may modulate the neurocircuitry of fear and is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of fear-related disorders. Therefore, we tested in the present experiment the hypothesis that noradrenaline and glucocorticoids, two major stress mediators, have differential effects on fear processing in men and women. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind between-subject design, 80 healthy men and women were administered orally the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine and/or the synthetic glucocorticoid hydrocortisone before they rated images of neutral and fearful faces with respect to the degree of fearfulness of the facial expression. During presentation of facial expressions, functional magnetic resonance images were collected. Yohimbine increased subjective ratings of the fearfulness of the faces in women but reduced fearfulness ratings in men. Neuroimaging data showed that yohimbine increased amygdala activity in response to fearful faces in women, whereas it attenuated amygdala responsivity to fearful faces in men. Moreover, yohimbine decreased orbitofrontal activity while viewing fearful faces in women. Hydrocortisone did not affect fear processing, neither in men nor in women. Our findings suggest that noradrenergic arousal may have opposite effects on fear processing in men and women.

Child, adolescent, and adult participants viewed cues indicating that a camera was alternately off, warming up, or projecting their image to a peer during the acquisition of behavioral-, autonomic-, and neural-response (functional MRI) data. Believing that a peer was actively watching them was sufficient to induce self-conscious emotion that rose in magnitude from childhood to adolescence and partially subsided into adulthood. Autonomic arousal was uniquely heightened in adolescents. These behavioral patterns were paralleled by emergent engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and striatum-MPFC connectivity during adolescence, which are thought to promote motivated social behavior in adolescence. These findings demonstrate that adolescents' self-consciousness is related to age-dependent sensitivity of brain systems critical to socioaffective processes. Further, unique interactions between the MPFC and striatum may provide a mechanism by which social-evaluation contexts influence adolescent behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804962,N,adolescent,,,

Epub 2013 Apr 11.","Genetic and pharmacological studies suggest an important role of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in flexible behavioral adaptation, mostly shown in reward-based learning paradigms. Recent evidence from imaging genetics indicates that also intentional cognitive flexibility, associated with lateral frontal cortex, is affected by variations in DRD2 signaling. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, we tested the effects of a direct pharmacological manipulation of DRD2 stimulation on intentional flexibility in a task-switching context, requiring switches between cognitive task rules and between response hands. In a double blind, counterbalanced design, participants received either a low dose of the DRD2 agonist bromocriptine or a placebo in two separate sessions. Bromocriptine modulated the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rule switching: rule-switching-related activity in the left posterior lateral frontal cortex and in the striatum was increased compared to placebo, at comparable performance levels. Fronto-striatal connectivity under bromocriptine was slightly increased for rule switches compared to rule repetitions. Hand-switching-related activity, in contrast, was reduced under bromocriptine in sensorimotor regions. Our results provide converging evidence for an involvement of DRD2 signaling in fronto-striatal mechanisms underlying intentional flexibility, and indicate that the neural mechanisms underlying different types of flexibility (cognitive vs motor) are affected differently by increased dopaminergic stimulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660437,N,no phys of interest,,,

Dopaminergic neurons from this system in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area complex (SN/VTA) fire in response to unexpected reinforcing cues. The goal of this study was to investigate whether individuals can gain voluntary control of SN/VTA activity, thereby potentially enhancing dopamine release to target brain regions. Neurofeedback and mental imagery were used to self-regulate the SN/VTA. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) provided abstract visual feedback of the SN/VTA activity while the subject imagined rewarding scenes. Skin conductance response (SCR) was recorded as a measure of emotional arousal. To examine the effect of neurofeedback, subjects were assigned to either receiving feedback directly proportional (n=15, veridical feedback) or inversely proportional (n=17, inverted feedback) to SN/VTA activity. Both groups of subjects were able to up-regulate SN/VTA activity initially without feedback. Veridical feedback improved the ability to up-regulate SN/VTA compared to baseline while inverted feedback did not. Additional dopaminergic regions were activated in both groups. The ability to self-regulate SN/VTA was differentially correlated with SCR depending on the group, suggesting an association between emotional arousal and neurofeedback performance. These findings indicate that SN/VTA can be voluntarily activated by imagery and voluntary activation is further enhanced by neurofeedback. The findings may lead the way towards a non-invasive strategy for endogenous control of dopamine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791838,N,no corr,,,

METHODS: We performed an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of brain responses to bladder filling in normal female subjects, evoked by infusion and withdrawal of fluid in and out of the bladder. Using the contrast (infusion-withdrawal), we imaged brain activity at small bladder volumes with weak filling sensation and also with full bladder and strong desire to void. RESULTS: Eleven women, average age 65 years (range: 60-71 years) were included. With full bladder and strong desire to void, filling provoked a well-known pattern of activation near the right insula and (as a trend) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area. There was no significant deactivation. With small bladder volume filling provoked widespread apparent deactivation and no significant activation. Apparent deactivation was associated with increased fMRI signal during withdrawal rather than decrease during infusion, suggesting artifact. A correction for global changes in cerebral blood flow eliminated it and revealed significant subcortical activation, although none in frontal or parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: In older women with normal bladder function, infusion into an already full bladder resulted in strong sensation and brain activation near the insula and in the dorsal anterior cingulate/supplementary motor complex. With near-empty bladder and little sensation, the situation during much of daily life, these cortical areas were not detectably activated, but activation in midbrain and parahippocampal regions presumably indicated unconscious monitoring of ascending bladder signals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23475745,N,no corr,,,

We investigate whether different respiratory manipulations, with arterial spin labeling used to measure CBF, lead to consistent measures of CVR. The approaches included: (1) an automated system delivering variable concentrations of inspired CO2 for prospective targeting of PETCO2, (2) administration of a fixed concentration of CO2 leading to subject-dependent changes in PETCO2, (3) a breath-hold (BH) paradigm with physiologic modeling of CO2 accumulation, and (4) a maneuver combining breath-hold and hyperventilation. When CVR was expressed as the percent change in CBF per mm Hg change in PETCO2, methods 1 to 3 gave consistent results. The CVR values using method 4 were significantly lower. When CVR was expressed in terms of the absolute change in CBF (mL/100 g per minute per mm Hg), greater discrepancies became apparent: methods 2 and 3 gave lower absolute CVR values compared with method 1, and the value obtained with method 4 was dramatically lower.

The present study assessed how pain-related neural processing varies across the menstrual cycle in normally cycling, healthy women, and whether menstrual cycle effects are based on fluctuating sex hormone levels. Fifteen subjects participated in 4 test sessions during their menstrual, midfollicular, ovulatory, and midluteal phases. Brain activity was measured while nonpainful and painful stimuli were applied with a pressure algometer. Serum hormone levels confirmed that scans were performed at appropriate cycle phases in 14 subjects. No significant cycle phase differences were found for pain intensity or unpleasantness ratings of stimuli applied during functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. However, lower pressure pain thresholds were found for follicular compared with other phases. Pain-specific brain activation was found in several regions traditionally associated with pain processing, including the medial thalamus, anterior and middle insula, midcingulate, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, cerebellum, and frontal regions. The inferior parietal lobule, occipital gyrus, cerebellum, and several frontal regions showed interaction effects between stimulus level and cycle phase, indicating differential processing of pain-related responses across menstrual cycle phases. Correlational analyses indicated that cycle-related changes in pain sensitivity measures and brain activation were only partly explained by varying sex hormone levels. These results show that pain-related cerebral activation varies significantly across the menstrual cycle, even when perceived pain intensity and unpleasantness remain constant. The involved brain regions suggest that cognitive pain or more general bodily awareness systems are most susceptible to menstrual cycle effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528204,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

It is not yet clear which physiological systems mediate the association between inter-individual variation in adiposity and white matter. We tested whether composite indicators of cardiovascular, lipid, glucose, and inflammatory factors would mediate the adiposity-related variation in white matter microstructure, measured with diffusion tensor imaging on a group of neurologically healthy adults (N=155). A composite factor representing adiposity (comprised of body mass index and waist circumference) was associated with smaller fractional anisotropy and greater radial diffusivity throughout the brain, a pattern previously linked to myelin structure changes in non-human animal models. A similar global negative association was found for factors representing inflammation and, to a lesser extent, glucose regulation. In contrast, factors for blood pressure and dyslipidemia had positive associations with white matter in isolated brain regions. Taken together, these competing influences on the diffusion signal were significant mediators linking adiposity to white matter and explained up to fifty-percent of the adiposity-white matter variance. These results provide the first evidence for contrasting physiological pathways, a globally distributed immunity-linked negative component and a more localized vascular-linked positive component, that associate adiposity to individual differences in the microstructure of white matter tracts in otherwise healthy adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639257,N,dti,,,

Therefore, the present study was designed to better understand the neural mechanisms that support associative learning processes, independent of expectancy, that influence the emotional response to a threat. Healthy volunteers took part in a Pavlovian conditioning procedure during which trait anxiety, expectation of the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), skin conductance response (SCR), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal were assessed. The results showed no evidence for associative learning that was independent of expectation. Threat-related SCR expression was diminished on predictable trials vs. unpredictable trials of the UCS (i.e. conditioned UCR diminution). Similar to SCR, conditioned UCR diminution was observed within the left dorsolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and left anterior insula. In contrast, potentiation of the threat-related fMRI signal response was observed within left dorsolateral PFC, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and posterior insula. A negative relationship was observed between UCS expectancy and UCR expression within the dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and anterior insula. Finally, the anticipatory fMRI signal responses within the PFC, posterior cingulate, and amygdala showed an inverse relationship with threat-related activation within the brain regions that showed UCR diminution.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 130 non-disabled, medically treated patients with either symptomatic extracranial carotid occlusion or intracranial stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery or middle cerebral arteries. All patients had baseline haemodynamic measurements with (15)O-gas positron emission tomography and were followed for 2 years or until stroke recurrence or death. RESULTS: There was a negative linear relationship between systolic BP (SBP) and risk of stroke in the territory of the diseased artery. The 2-year incidence of ischaemic stroke in the territory in patients with normal SBP (<130 mm Hg, 5/32 patients) was significantly higher than in patients with high SBP (2/98, p<0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that normal SBP and impaired perfusion were independently associated with increased risk of stroke in the previously affected territory, while risk of stroke elsewhere was positively correlated with SBP. Overall, high total stroke risk was observed at lower BP in patients with impaired perfusion and at higher BPs in patients without (interaction, p<0.01). Overall, the relationship between SBP and total stroke recurrence was J-shaped.

We quantified the concurrent changes of the EEG power in the alpha frequency band, the respiration volume, and the cardiac pulse rate, then assessed the temporal correlations between alpha EEG power and physiological signal fluctuations. In addition, time-shifted time courses of alpha EEG power or physiological data were included as regressors to examine their correlations with the whole-brain BOLD fMRI signals. We observed a significant correlation between alpha EEG global field power and respiration, particularly at eyes-closed resting condition. Similar spatial patterns were observed between the correlation maps of BOLD with alpha EEG power and respiration, with negative correlations coinciding in the visual cortex, superior/middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule and positive correlations in the thalamus and caudate.

Pathoepidemiological models propose a role for chronic social stress and perceived discrimination for mental health risk in ethnic minorities, but the neurobiology is unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To study neural social stress processing, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and associations with perceived discrimination in ethnic minority individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional design in a university setting using 3 validated paradigms to challenge neural social stress processing and, to probe for specificity, emotional and cognitive brain functions. Healthy participants included those with German lineage (n = 40) and those of ethnic minority (n = 40) from different ethnic backgrounds matched for sociodemographic, psychological, and task performance characteristics. Control comparisons examined stress processing with matched ethnic background of investigators (23 Turkish vs 23 German participants) and basic emotional and cognitive tasks (24 Turkish vs 24 German participants). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blood oxygenation level-dependent response, functional connectivity, and psychological and physiological measures. RESULTS: There were significant increases in heart rate (P < .001), subjective emotional response (self-related emotions, P < .001; subjective anxiety, P = .006), and salivary cortisol level (P = .004) during functional magnetic resonance imaging stress induction. Ethnic minority individuals had significantly higher perceived chronic stress levels (P = .02) as well as increased activation (family-wise error-corrected [FWE] P = .005, region of interest corrected) and increased functional connectivity (PFWE = .01, region of interest corrected) of perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The effects were specific to stress and not explained by a social distance effect. Ethnic minority individuals had significant correlations between perceived group discrimination and activation in perigenual ACC (PFWE = .001, region of interest corrected) and ventral striatum (PFWE = .02, whole brain corrected) and mediation of the relationship between perceived discrimination and perigenual ACC-dorsal ACC connectivity by chronic stress (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Epidemiologists proposed a causal role of social-evaluative stress, but the neural processes that could mediate this susceptibility effect were unknown. Our data demonstrate the potential of investigating associations from epidemiology with neuroimaging, suggest brain effects of social marginalization, and highlight a neural system in which environmental and genetic risk factors for mental illness may converge.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740491,N,no corr,,,

The extent to which violent media exposure impacts brain and behavior has been debated. Yet there is not enough experimental data to inform this debate. We hypothesize that reaction to violent media is critically dependent on personality/trait differences between viewers, where those with the propensity for physical assault will respond to the media differently than controls. The source of the variability, we further hypothesize, is reflected in autonomic response and brain functioning that differentiate those with aggression tendencies from others. To test this hypothesis we pre-selected a group of aggressive individuals and non-aggressive controls from the normal healthy population; we documented brain, blood-pressure, and behavioral responses during resting baseline and while the groups were watching media violence and emotional media that did not portray violence. Positron Emission Tomography was used with [18F]fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) to image brain metabolic activity, a marker of brain function, during rest and during film viewing while blood-pressure and mood ratings were intermittently collected. Results pointed to robust resting baseline differences between groups. Aggressive individuals had lower relative glucose metabolism in the medial orbitofrontal cortex correlating with poor self-control and greater glucose metabolism in other regions of the default-mode network (DMN) where precuneus correlated with negative emotionality. These brain results were similar while watching the violent media, during which aggressive viewers reported being more Inspired and Determined and less Upset and Nervous, and also showed a progressive decline in systolic blood-pressure compared to controls. Furthermore, the blood-pressure and brain activation in orbitofrontal cortex and precuneus were differentially coupled between the groups.

Patients with poorly controlled LTLE showed negative association between seizure frequency and activation in the bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate (p<0.05, corrected). This study is the first to characterize the cortical and physiologic responses to acute psychosocial stress and to show a significant relationship between seizure control in LTLE and both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and fMRI signal reactivity to acute psychosocial stress.

However, non-human animal data has shown that amygdala dependent threat (fear) learning can also lead to long lasting changes in cortical sensitivity, persisting even after extinction of fear responses. The neural mechanisms of long-lasting traces of such conditioning in humans have not yet been explored. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and assessed skin conductance responses (SCR) during threat acquisition, extinction learning and extinction retrieval. We provide evidence of lasting cortical plasticity in the human brain following threat extinction and show that enhanced blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal to the learned threat stimulus in the auditory association cortex is resistant to extinction. These findings point to a parallel avenue by which cortical processing of potentially dangerous stimuli can be long lasting, even when immediate threat and the associated amygdala modulation have subsided.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525224,N,no corr,,,

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural substrate underlying whole body instability, based on the self-recognition paradigm that uses video stimuli consisting of one's own and others' whole bodies depicted in stable and unstable states. Analyses revealed significant activity in the regions which would be activated during genuine unstable bodily states: The right parieto-insular vestibular cortex, inferior frontal junction, posterior insula and parabrachial nucleus.

In contrast to these findings, we show that individuals can learn to associate a face with the later occurrence of a shock, even if they are unable to perceive the face. We used a novel application of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to non-invasively record neural activity from the amygdala, which is known to be important for fear learning. We demonstrate rapid ( approximately 170-200 ms) amygdala responses during the stimulus free period between the face and the shock. These results suggest that unperceived faces can serve as signals for impending threat, and that rapid, automatic activation of the amygdala contributes to this process.

The explicit task required judgments about emotions being expressed in photographs of faces, while the implicit one required judgments about the age of the people in the photographs. Patients and healthy differed in labeling neutral faces, but not other emotions. They also differed in their SCR to emotions, though the profile depended on which hand the recordings were from. Finally, we found relationships between the thickness of the insula and SCR to each task: in the healthy group the thickness of the left insula was related to SCR to the emotion-labeling task; in the patient group it was between the thickness of the right insula and SCR in the age-labeling task.

Previous research in humans separately examined the mechanisms underlying acquisition and extinction of aversive and appetitive conditioned responses. It is yet unclear how aversive and appetitive learning interact on a neural level during counterconditioning in humans. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the interaction of fear conditioning and subsequent reward learning. In the first phase (fear acquisition), images predicted aversive electric shocks or no aversive outcome. In the second phase (counterconditioning), half of the CS+ and CS- were associated with monetary reward in the absence of electric stimulation. The third phase initiated reinstatement of fear through presentation of electric shocks, followed by CS presentation in the absence of shock or reward. Results indicate that participants were impaired at learning the reward contingencies for stimuli previously associated with shock. In the counterconditioning phase, prior fear association interacted with reward representation in the amygdala, where activation was decreased for rewarded compared to unrewarded CS- trials, while there was no reward-related difference in CS+ trials. In the reinstatement phase, an interaction of previous fear association and previous reward status was observed in a reward network consisting of substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), where activation was increased by previous reward association only for CS- but not for CS+ trials.

Here we demonstrate that VMN CB1 receptors regulate metabolic flexibility and actions of leptin. In chow-fed mice, conditional deletion of CB1 in VMN neurons (expressing the steroidogenic factor 1, SF1) decreases adiposity by increasing sympathetic activity and lipolysis, and facilitates metabolic effects of leptin. Conversely, under high-fat diet, lack of CB1 in VMN neurons produces leptin resistance, blunts peripheral use of lipid substrates and increases adiposity.

Analysis of skin conductance data during a delay phase revealed an interaction between reward and threat processing, such that the effect of reward was reduced during threat and the effect of threat was reduced during reward. Analysis of imaging data during the same task phase revealed interactions between reward and threat processing in several regions, including the midbrain/ventral tegmental area, caudate, putamen, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior insula, middle frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.

Human emotions can be conceptualised within a two-dimensional model comprised of emotional valence and arousal (intensity). These variables are at least in part distinct, but recent studies report interactive effects during implicit emotion processing and relate these to stimulus-evoked approach-withdrawal tendencies. The aim of the present study was to explore how valence and arousal interact at the neural level, during implicit emotion word processing. The emotional attributes of written word stimuli were orthogonally manipulated based on behavioural ratings from a corpus of emotion words. Stimuli were presented during an fMRI experiment while 16 participants performed a lexical decision task, which did not require explicit evaluation of a word's emotional content. Results showed greater neural activation within right insular cortex in response to stimuli evoking conflicting approach-withdrawal tendencies (i.e., positive high-arousal and negative low-arousal words) compared to stimuli evoking congruent approach vs. withdrawal tendencies (i.e., positive low-arousal and negative high-arousal words). Further, a significant cluster of activation in the left extra-striate cortex was found in response to emotional than neutral words, suggesting enhanced perceptual processing of emotionally salient stimuli. These findings support an interactive two-dimensional approach to the study of emotion word recognition and suggest that the integration of valence and arousal dimensions recruits a brain region associated with interoception, emotional awareness and sympathetic functions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440410,N,no phys of interest,,,

Our results show a gradient of informational specificity along the ventral stream from representations of image-based visual properties in early visual cortex, to categorical representations in the posterior ventral stream. A key finding showed that object-specific semantic information is uniquely represented in the perirhinal cortex, which was also increasingly engaged for objects that are more semantically confusable. These findings suggest a key role for the perirhinal cortex in representing and processing object-specific semantic information that is more critical for highly confusable objects.

The locus-coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system regulates a central orienting response to behaviorally relevant events, and might therefore signal the need to attend to and learn from performance feedback. Memories of such events also rely on elevated NE, suggesting that LC activity not only responds to salient performance outcomes but also strengthens memory for stimuli associated with their occurrence. In the present study, we used a monetary incentive delay paradigm to determine whether LC functional connectivity during reaction time feedback relates to trial-by-trial memory of preceding photo-objects. We used one psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to examine patterns of LC functional connectivity that were associated with subsequent memory for picture trials in which negative or positive feedback was given, and a second PPI analysis to investigate whether successfully encoded objects from trials with uncertain outcomes were related to distinct patterns of LC functional connectivity across the brain. The PPI results revealed that successfully encoded negative feedback trials (i.e., responses exceeding the response deadline) were uniquely associated with enhanced functional coupling between the LC and left anterior insula. Furthermore, successful memory for objects in low reaction time certainty trials (i.e., responses closest to the response deadline) were linked to positive LC functional coupling with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The origins of HFs may lie in brainstem structures where neuronal activity may occur earlier than in interoceptive centers, such as the insula and the prefrontal cortex. To study such time ordering, we conducted blood oxygen level-dependent-based fMRI in a group of postmenopausal women to measure neuronal activity in the brainstem, insula, and prefrontal cortex around the onset of an HF (detected using synchronously acquired skin conductance responses). Rise in brainstem activity occurred before the detectable onset of an HF. Activity in the insular and prefrontal trailed that in the brainstem, appearing following the onset of the HF. Additional activations associated with HF's were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex and the basal ganglia.

The collateral flow feature within the circle of Willis allows the ability to maintain cerebral perfusion of the brain. Unfortunately, this collateral flow feature can create undesirable flow impact locations due to anatomical variations within the CoW. The interaction between hemodynamic forces and the arterial wall are believed to be involved in the formation of cerebral aneurysms, especially at irregular geometries such as tortuous segments, bends, and bifurcations. The highest propensity of aneurysm formation is known to form at the anterior communicating artery (AcoA) and at the junctions of the internal carotid and posterior communicating arteries (PcoAs). Controversy still remains as to the existence of blood flow paths through the communicating arteries for a normal CoW. This paper experimentally describes the hemodynamic conditions through three thin walled patient specific models of a complete CoW based on medical images. These models were manufactured by a horizontal dip spin coating method and positioned within a custom made cerebral testing system that simulated symmetrical physiological afferent flow conditions through the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. The dip spin coating procedure produced excellent dimensional accuracy. There was an average of less than 4% variation in diameters and wall thicknesses throughout all manufactured CoW models. Our cerebral test facility demonstrated excellent cycle to cycle repeatability, with variations of less than 2% and 1% for the time and cycle averaged flow rates, respectively. The peak systolic flow rates had less than a 4% variation. Our flow visualizations showed four independent flow sources originating from all four inlet arteries impacting at and crossing the AcoA with bidirectional cross flows. The flow paths entering the left and right vertebral arteries dissipated throughout the CoW vasculature from the posterior to anterior sides, exiting through all efferent vessels. Two of the models had five flow impact locations, while the third model had an additional two impact locations within the posterior circulation caused by an additional bidirectional cross flows along the PcoAs during the accelerating and part of the decelerating phases. For a complete CoW, bidirectional cross flows exist within the AcoA and geometrical variations within the CoW geometry can either promote uni- or bidirectional cross flows along the PcoAs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24141631,N,clinical,,,

SP6 elicits greater and anatomically different activations than those of sham stimuli; that is, the salience network, a unique interoceptive autonomic circuit, may indicate the mechanism underlying acupuncture in restoring sleep deprivation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25024729,N,no corr,,,

Here, we investigated whether the processing of brief fear stimuli is selectively gated by their timing in relation to individual heartbeats. Emotional and neutral faces were presented to human volunteers at cardiac systole, when ejection of blood from the heart causes arterial baroreceptors to signal centrally the strength and timing of each heartbeat, and at diastole, the period between heartbeats when baroreceptors are quiescent. Participants performed behavioral and neuroimaging tasks to determine whether these interoceptive signals influence the detection of emotional stimuli at the threshold of conscious awareness and alter judgments of emotionality of fearful and neutral faces. Our results show that fearful faces were detected more easily and were rated as more intense at systole than at diastole. Correspondingly, amygdala responses were greater to fearful faces presented at systole relative to diastole. These novel findings highlight a major channel by which short-term interoceptive fluctuations enhance perceptual and evaluative processes specifically related to the processing of fear and threat and counter the view that baroreceptor afferent signaling is always inhibitory to sensory perception.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806682,N,no corr,,,

Proposed mechanisms include enhanced fear learning and impaired extinction or extinction recall. Documented extinction recall deficits and failure to use safety signals could result from general failure to use contextual information, a hippocampus-dependent process. This can be probed by adding a renewal phase to standard conditioning and extinction paradigms. Human subjects with PTSD and combat controls were conditioned (skin conductance response), extinguished, and tested for extinction retention and renewal in a scanner (fMRI). Fear conditioning (light paired with shock) occurred in one context, followed by extinction in another, to create danger and safety contexts. The next day, the extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS+E) was re-presented to assess extinction recall (safety context) and fear renewal (danger context). PTSD patients showed impaired extinction recall, with increased skin conductance and heightened amygdala activity to the extinguished CS+ in the safety context. However, they also showed impaired fear renewal; in the danger context, they had less skin conductance response to CS+E and lower activity in amygdala and ventral-medial prefrontal cortex compared with combat controls. Control subjects displayed appropriate contextual modulation of memory recall, with extinction (safety) memory prevailing in the safety context, and fear memory prevailing in the danger context. PTSD patients could not use safety context to sustain suppression of extinguished fear memory, but they also less effectively used danger context to enhance fear. They did not display globally enhanced fear expression, but rather showed a globally diminished capacity to use contextual information to modulate fear expression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274821,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2014 Jan 14.","BACKGROUND: Excessive adipose tissue, particularly with a centralized distribution, propagates hormonal and metabolic disturbance. The detrimental effects of adiposity may extend beyond the periphery and target the central nervous system, increasing vulnerability to cognitive decline. The aim of the current study was to determine how central adiposity impacts the brain at midlife by examining the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to a challenging cognitive task. METHODS: Seventy-three adults, aged 40-60 years, completed a 2-back verbal working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Central adiposity was assessed with waist circumference. The association between waist circumference and task-related activation in a priori regions of interest was modeled using bootstrapping regression models corrected for multiple-comparisons. RESULTS: Larger waist circumference was associated with diminished working-memory-related BOLD response in the right superior frontal gyrus (beta=-0.008, P=0.001, 95% CI: -0.012 to -0.004) and left middle frontal gyrus (beta=-0.009, P=0.002, 95% CI: -0.015 to -0.003), statistically adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. Reduced task-related activation in the right superior frontal gyrus (r=-0.369, P=0.002) and left middle frontal gyrus (r=-0.266, P=0.025) were related to slower reaction time on the task, controlling for age and education. CONCLUSIONS: Larger waist circumference predicted alterations in the BOLD response that coupled with decrements in task performance. While future studies are necessary, the results suggest that similar to its role in the periphery, central adiposity may be a robust predictor of metabolic and hormonal alterations that impinge upon central nervous system functioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418893,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: The aim of this pilot prospective parallel group cohort study was to investigate the neural correlates of clinical decision-making, and to determine if simulation as opposed to online training influences these neural correlates. Twelve third-year medical students were randomized into two groups and received simulation-based or online-based training on anaphylaxis. This was followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to detect brain activation patterns while answering multiple choice questions (MCQs) related to anaphylaxis, and unrelated non-clinical (control) questions. Performance in the MCQs, salivary cortisol levels, heart rate, and arterial pressure were also measured. RESULTS: Comparing neural responses to clinical and non-clinical questions (in all participants), significant areas of activation were seen in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. These areas were activated in the online group when answering action-based questions related to their training, but not in the simulation group. The simulation group tended to react more quickly and accurately to clinical MCQs than the online group, but statistical significance was not reached. CONCLUSIONS: The activation areas seen could indicate increased stress when answering clinical questions compared with general non-clinical questions, and in the online group when answering action-based clinical questions. These findings suggest simulation training attenuates neural responses related to stress when making clinical decisions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24065729,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2014 Sep 28.","PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effect of epilepsy on the development of hyperlipidemia (HL) in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study based on data obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. We identified 990 cases involving patients whose epilepsy was newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2005, and we also selected a comparison cohort comprising 3960 patients without epilepsy. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the association between epilepsy and HL. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 6.63 years for the epilepsy cohort and 7.49 years for the comparison cohort. The incidence rate of HL was 1.28-fold higher in the epilepsy cohort than it was in the comparison cohort (34.14 vs. 26.96 per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.36) after adjusting the model to account for the effects of sex and comorbidities. The most at-risk patients were those aged 50 to 59 years (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.79). For the epilepsy patients, the combined effect of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing HL compared with the patients with neither epilepsy nor any comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Middle-aged epilepsy patients are at a significantly higher risk of developing HL. The results could assist in explaining the high risk of cerebral and cardiac vascular disease in epilepsy patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25444891,N,clinical,,,

METHODS: Ten healthy young men (age 29 +/- 5 yrs, BMI 24.7 +/- 2.8 kg/m2) breathed normobaric hypoxic gas mixture (11% O2/89% N2) for one hour. Venous blood samples were obtained immediately before, during, and 2 and 24 hours after hypoxic exposure. Cardiac function and flow velocity profile in the middle left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were measured by Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: Arterial oxygen saturation decreased steadily from baseline value of 99 +/- 1% after the initiation hypoxia challenge and reached steady-state level of 73 +/- 6% within 20-30 minutes. Cardiac output increased from 6.0 +/- 1.2 to 8.1 +/- 1.6 L/min and ejection fraction from 67 +/- 4% to 75 +/- 6% (both p < 0.001). Peak diastolic flow velocity in the LAD increased from 0.16 +/- 0.04 to 0.28 +/- 0.07 m/s, while its diameter remained unchanged. In the whole study group, NT-proBNP was similar to baseline (60 +/- 32 pmol/ml) at all time points. However, at 24 h, concentration of NT-proBNP was higher (34 +/- 18%) in five subjects and lower (17 +/- 17%), p = 0.002 between the groups) in five subjects than at baseline. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there is no consistent increase in circulating NT-proBNP in response to breathing severely hypoxic normobaric gas mixture in healthy humans, a possible reason being that the oxygen flux to cardiac myocytes does not decrease because of increased coronary blood flow. However, the divergent individual responses as well as responses in different cardiac diseases warrant further investigations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989366,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2014 Apr 5.","Adverse learning experiences play a significant role in the etiology of anxiety disorders. However, not all individuals experiencing negative events develop heightened anxiety. This is possibly due to individual differences in the regulation of negative emotions associated with these negative events. Cognitive reappraisal is defined as reinterpreting an emotion-eliciting situation in a way that changes its emotional impact. A more frequent use of cognitive reappraisal in daily life has been shown to be more adaptive. However, no study to date examined the association of dispositional cognitive reappraisal with emotional learning, in order to elucidate individual differences in negative emotional responses towards aversive events. The goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the association of dispositional cognitive reappraisal with subjective, electrodermal and neural correlates of fear acquisition and extinction. Data of 41 healthy individuals, who participated in a socially relevant differential conditioning paradigm (acquisition and extinction learning: day 1, extinction recall: day 2), were acquired. Dispositional cognitive reappraisal was negatively associated with right insula, and hippocampus activation during acquisition. Furthermore, the reduction of self-reported conditioned fear during extinction learning as well as reduced insula and enhanced rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation during extinction learning was related to cognitive reappraisal. In addition, reduced recovery of conditioned arousal, reduced anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation and enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation during extinction recall was observed in individuals with higher cognitive reappraisal scores. The results indicate that dispositional cognitive reappraisal modulates subjective and neural correlates of fear conditioning, probably leading to reduced acquisition and stronger extinction learning and recall. These results point to the important role of dispositional cognitive reappraisal in the development and modification of conditioned emotional responses and might further improve our understanding of anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713451,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

However, little is known about the impact of exercise on neurodevelopment during the adolescent years, particularly with regard to white matter microstructure, as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and tractography-based along-tract statistics were utilized to examine the relationship between white matter microstructure and aerobic exercise in adolescent males, ages 15-18. Furthermore, we examined the data by both (1) grouping individuals based on aerobic fitness self-reports (high fit (HF) vs. low fit (LF)), and (2) using VO2 peak as a continuous variable across the entire sample. Results showed that HF youth had an overall higher number of streamline counts compared to LF peers, which was driven by group differences in corticospinal tract (CST) and anterior corpus callosum (Fminor). In addition, VO2 peak was negatively related to FA in the left CST. Together, these results suggest that aerobic fitness relates to white matter connectivity and microstructure in tracts carrying frontal and motor fibers during adolescence.

Epub 2014 Mar 11.","While previous studies successfully identified the core neural substrates of the animal subtype of specific phobia, only few and inconsistent research is available for dental phobia. These findings might partly relate to the fact that, typically, visual stimuli were employed. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of stimulus modality on neural fear processing in dental phobia. Thirteen dental phobics (DP) and thirteen healthy controls (HC) attended a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) symptom provocation paradigm encompassing both visual and auditory stimuli. Drill sounds and matched neutral sinus tones served as auditory stimuli and dentist scenes and matched neutral videos as visual stimuli. Group comparisons showed increased activation in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and thalamus in DP compared to HC during auditory but not visual stimulation. On the contrary, no differential autonomic reactions were observed in DP. Present results are largely comparable to brain areas identified in animal phobia, but also point towards a potential downregulation of autonomic outflow by neural fear circuits in this disorder. Findings enlarge our knowledge about neural correlates of dental phobia and may help to understand the neural underpinnings of the clinical and physiological characteristics of the disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738049,N,clinical,,,

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between measures of arterial stiffness and change in Abeta deposition over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Deposition of Abeta was determined in a longitudinal observational study of aging by positron emission tomography using the Pittsburgh compound B twice 2 years apart in 81 nondemented individuals 83 years and older. Arterial stiffness was measured with a noninvasive and automated waveform analyzer at the time closest to the second positron emission tomography scan. All measures were performed under standardized conditions. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in the central (carotid-femoral and heart-femoral PWV), peripheral (femoral-ankle PWV), and mixed (brachial-ankle PWV) vascular beds. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The change in Abeta deposition over 2 years was calculated from the 81 individuals with repeat Abeta-positron emission tomography. RESULTS: The proportion of Abeta-positive individuals increased from 48% at baseline to 75% at follow-up. Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly higher among Abeta-positive participants at baseline and follow-up. Femoral-ankle PWV was only higher among Abeta-positive participants at follow-up. Measures of central stiffness and blood pressure were not associated with Abeta status at baseline or follow-up, but central stiffness was associated with a change in Abeta deposition over time. Each standard deviation increase in central stiffness (carotid-femoral PWV, P = .001; heart-femoral PWV, P = .004) was linked with increases in Abeta deposition over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study showed that Abeta deposition increases with age in nondemented individuals and that arterial stiffness is strongly associated with the progressive deposition of Abeta in the brain, especially in this age group. The association between Abeta deposition changes over time and generalized arterial stiffness indicated a relationship between the severity of subclinical vascular disease and progressive cerebral Abeta deposition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687165,N,no brain data,,,

Yet, it is unclear how AI activity correlates with feelings during social emotions, and whether this correlation may be influenced by culture, as studies correlating real-time AI activity with visceral states and feelings have focused on Western subjects feeling physical pain or basic disgust. Given psychological evidence that social-emotional feelings are cognitively constructed within cultural frames, we asked Chinese and American participants to report their feeling strength to admiration and compassion-inducing narratives during fMRI with simultaneous electrocardiogram recording. Trial-by-trial, cardiac arousal and feeling strength correlated with ventral and dorsal AI activity bilaterally but predicted different variance, suggesting that interoception and social-emotional feeling construction are concurrent but dissociable AI functions. Further, although the variance that correlated with cardiac arousal did not show cultural effects, the variance that correlated with feelings did. Feeling strength was especially associated with ventral AI activity (the autonomic modulatory sector) in the Chinese group but with dorsal AI activity (the visceral-somatosensory/cognitive sector) in an American group not of Asian descent. This cultural group difference held after controlling for posterior insula (PI) activity and was replicated. A bi-cultural East-Asian American group showed intermediate results. The findings help elucidate how the AI supports feelings and suggest that previous reports that dorsal AI activation reflects feeling strength are culture related. More broadly, the results suggest that the brain's ability to construct conscious experiences of social emotion is less closely tied to visceral processes than neurobiological models predict and at least partly open to cultural influence and learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278862,N,no corr,rand,,

Despite numerous studies, the etiology of preeclampsia has not yet been fully elucidated. There has been confliction in results on the role of maternal lead in preeclampsia. Keeping in view with the scarcity of data on role of lead in preeclamptic women of Saudi Arabia and the disparity in earlier findings, the present study was carried out to determine the levels of maternal serum lead in patients with preeclampsia in comparison to normal pregnancy. The study consisted of 120 pregnant women divided into three groups of 40 each, control, HR group and PET group. The serum levels of lead were estimated by Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. We found that the mean value of serum lead was 18.23 +/- 2.34, 20.08 +/- 2.15 and 27.18 +/- 2.13 microg/dl in control, high risk group and preeclamptic group respectively. The levels of Pb were found to decrease significantly (P < 0.05) in preeclamptic group compared to control. However, there was no significant change in levels of Pb when HR group was compared to Control and preeclamptic group. In the present study, we observed that serum levels of lead were positively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure and were statistically significant (P < 0.05). However, negative correlation was observed between Pb and BMI ruling out the association of BMI with preeclampsia. It is thus concluded that preeclampsia is associated with significant increase in maternal lead and these increasing levels of serum lead pose a significant risk in pregnant women to preeclampsia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25031738,N,no brain data,,,

However, few clinical trials have investigated the effect of EPO in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. This study was an exploratory pilot study to investigate the effects of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) on motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in PD patients. METHODS: A total of 26 PD patients at the Hanyang University Hospital were enrolled in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to rhEPO and placebo groups. The rhEPO group was infused intravenously (40,000 IU each) twice a week for 5 weeks. Clinical improvement was estimated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III), the NMS Scale (NMSS) and the 39-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). [(18)F] N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) photon emission tomography (PET) scanning was performed on each participant at baseline and again after 12 months. RESULTS: The rhEPO administration significantly improved the NMSS and PDQ-39 scores at 12 months. The UPDRS-III, which reflects motor function, did not change significantly after the rhEPO treatment. With the NMSS, the domains of cardiovascular autonomic function, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition and attention/memory showed significant changes. None of the participants experienced any serious adverse effects. DISCUSSION: We found that rhEPO had beneficial effects on NMS but not on motor function.

Analyses were undertaken in 284 healthy older twins (66% female; 79 MZ and 63 DZ pairs) from the Older Australian Twins Study. The average age of the sample was 69.82 (SD = 4.76) years. Brain imaging scans were collected and DTI measures were estimated for the whole CC as well as its five subregions. Parcellation of the CC was performed using Analyze. In addition, white matter lesion (WMLs) burden was estimated. Heritability and genetic correlation analyses were undertaken using the SOLAR software package. Age, sex, scanner, handedness and blood pressure were considered as covariates. Heritability (h(2)) analysis for the DTI metrics of whole CC, indicated significant h(2) for fractional anisotropy (FA) (h(2) = 0.56; p = 2.89x10(-10)), mean diffusivity (MD) (h(2) = 0.52; p = 0.30x10(-6)), radial diffusivity (RD) (h(2) = 0.49; p = 0.2x10(-6)) and axial diffusivity (AD) (h(2) = 0.37; p = 8.15x10(-5)). We also performed bivariate genetic correlation analyses between (i) whole CC DTI measures and (ii) whole CC DTI measures with total brain WML burden. Across the DTI measures for the whole CC, MD and RD shared 84% of the common genetic variance, followed by MD-AD (77%), FA-RD (52%), RD-AD (37%) and FA-MD (11%). For total WMLs, significant genetic correlations indicated that there was 19% shared common genetic variance with whole CC MD, followed by CC RD (17%), CC AD (16%) and CC FA (5%). Our findings suggest that the CC microstructure is under moderate genetic control. There was also evidence of shared genetic factors between the CC DTI measures. In contrast, there was less shared genetic variance between WMLs and the CC DTI metrics, suggesting fewer common genetic variants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25514436,N,no brain data,,,

Implementation of the continuously adaptive windowing strategy (CLAWS) could increase respiratory efficiency, but the resulting non-smooth k-space acquisition order during gadolinium wash-out could result in increased artifact. METHODS: Navigator-gated three-dimensional late gadolinium enhancement acquisitions were performed in 18 patients using tracking end-expiratory accept/reject (EE-ARA) and CLAWS algorithms in random order. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of the stored navigator data shows that CLAWS scan times are very close to (within 1%) or equal to the fastest achievable scan times while EE-ARA significantly extends the acquisition duration (P < 0.0001). EE-ARA acquisitions are 26% longer than CLAWS acquisitions (378 +/- 104 s compared to 301 +/- 85 s, P = 0.002). Image quality scores for CLAWS and EE-ARA acquisitions are not significantly different (4.1 +/- 0.6 compared to 4.3 +/- 0.6, P = ns). Numerical phantom simulations show that the non-uniform k-space ordering introduced by CLAWS results in slight, but not statistically significant, reductions in both blood signal-to-noise ratio (10%) and blood-myocardium contrast-to-noise ratio (12%).

METHODS: Compliance testing was performed on 3 prostheses with and without internal compliant membrane (ICM). The principle of this test was to study the dimensional changes of prostheses submitted to internal pressure from 30 to 240 mm Hg at intervals of predetermined values. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the ICM created links with the inner surface of the crimps and considerably modified the graft behavior when submitted to internal pressure. The results showed that compliance properties were dependent on the wall thickness and the crimping geometry of textile vascular prostheses. Mechanical analysis predicts the circumferential tensile behavior of these arterial grafts and validates tests for measuring compliance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756779,N,no brain data,,,

In an effort to better understand the brain-gut communication induced by the absorption and metabolism of nutrients in healthy lean and obese individuals, we investigated whether ingestion of nutritive and non-nutritive sweetened beverages differentially engages the hypothalamus and brainstem vagal pathways in lean and obese women. METHODS: In a 2-day, double-blind crossover study, 11 lean and 11 obese healthy women underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans after ingestion of 2 beverages of different sucrose content, but identical sweetness. During scans, subjects rested with eyes closed. RESULTS: Blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations demonstrated significantly greater power in the highest frequency band (slow-3: 0.073-0.198 Hz) after ingestion of high-sucrose compared with low-sucrose beverages in the nucleus tractus solitarius for both groups. Obese women had greater connectivity between the right lateral hypothalamus and a reward-related brain region and weaker connectivity with homeostasis and gustatory-related brain regions than lean women. CONCLUSIONS: In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we observed sucrose-related changes in oscillatory dynamics of blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations in brainstem and hypothalamus in lean and obese women. The observed frequency changes are consistent with a rapid vagally mediated mechanism due to nutrient absorption, rather than sweet taste receptor activation. These findings provide support for altered interaction between homeostatic and reward networks in obese individuals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480616,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2014 Apr 21.","The transition from being fully awake to pre-sleep occurs daily just before falling asleep; thus its disturbance might be detrimental. Yet, the neuronal correlates of the transition remain unclear, mainly due to the difficulty in capturing its inherent dynamics. We used an EEG theta/alpha neurofeedback to rapidly induce the transition into pre-sleep and simultaneous fMRI to reveal state-dependent neural activity. The relaxed mental state was verified by the corresponding enhancement in the parasympathetic response. Neurofeedback sessions were categorized as successful or unsuccessful, based on the known EEG signature of theta power increases over alpha, temporally marked as a distinct ""crossover"" point. The fMRI activation was considered before and after this point. During successful transition into pre-sleep the period before the crossover was signified by alpha modulation that corresponded to decreased fMRI activity mainly in sensory gating related regions (e.g. medial thalamus). In parallel, although not sufficient for the transition, theta modulation corresponded with increased activity in limbic and autonomic control regions (e.g. hippocampus, cerebellum vermis, respectively). The post-crossover period was designated by alpha modulation further corresponding to reduced fMRI activity within the anterior salience network (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula), and in contrast theta modulation corresponded to the increased variance in the posterior salience network (e.g. posterior insula, posterior cingulate cortex). Our findings portray multi-level neural dynamics underlying the mental transition from awake to pre-sleep. To initiate the transition, decreased activity was required in external monitoring regions, and to sustain the transition, opposition between the anterior and posterior parts of the salience network was needed, reflecting shifting from extra- to intrapersonal based processing, respectively.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768931,N,no phys of interest,,,

One major control variable of the baroreflex is the sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity to muscles [MSNA; burst frequency (BF) and burst incidence (BI)], which can be quantitatively assessed by microneurography. We aimed to investigate the central regions involved in baroreflex regulation of MSNA. Healthy men (mean age 25 years) participated in three experimental sessions. (i) Microneurography recordings of MSNA from the left peroneal nerve during rest and baroreflex unloading, induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP; -40 mmHg). If MSNA could be reliably recorded throughout this procedure (n = 15), the subjects entered the positron emission tomography (PET) experiments. The two PET sessions took place in a randomised order. Cerebral glucose metabolism (18-fluorodeoxyglucose) was analysed after: (ii) baroreflex unloading (LBNP); and (iii) control condition (lying in the LBNP chamber without suction). The PET data were analysed employing SPM8. LBNP elicited a significant increase in MSNA in all successfully recorded subjects (BI: P = 0.001; F = 5.54; BF: P < 0.001; F = 36.59). As compared with the control condition, LBNP was associated with increased PET regional glucose metabolism bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; BA 11, 47).

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied all patients aged >/=16 years admitted to the hospital because of acute pericarditis (postpericardiotomy and myocardial infarction associated pericarditis were excluded). Data were collected from a Finnish national registry that included data on all cardiovascular admissions (670 409) during 9.5 years in 29 hospitals nationwide. During the study period, there were 1361 admissions for acute pericarditis. Pericarditis patients were more likely to be male (64.9% of patients) than female (35.1%), with an age-adjusted likelihood ratio of 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-2.06; P<0.0001) for male sex. The standardized incidence rate of hospitalizations for acute pericarditis was 3.32 per 100 000 person-years. Men 16 to 65 years of age were at higher risk for pericarditis (relative risk, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.81-2.26; P<0.0001) than women in the general admitted population, with the highest risk difference among young adults. Acute pericarditis caused 0.20% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.22%) of all cardiovascular admissions. The proportion of pericarditis-caused admissions declined by an estimated 51% per 10-year increase in age.

Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) provides a means of helping people learn to self-regulate activation in this brain region. Using the Blood Oxygenated Level Dependant (BOLD) signal from the right AI (RAI) as neurofeedback, we trained participants to increase RAI activation. In contrast, another group of participants was shown 'control' feedback from another brain area. Pre- and post-training affective probes were shown, with subjective ratings and skin conductance response (SCR) measured. We also investigated a reward-related reinforcement learning model of rtfMRI-NF. In contrast to the controls, we hypothesised a positive linear increase in RAI activation in participants shown feedback from this region, alongside increases in valence ratings and SCR to affective probes. Hypothesis-driven analyses showed a significant interaction between the RAI/control neurofeedback groups and the effect of self-regulation. Whole-brain analyses revealed a significant linear increase in RAI activation across four training runs in the group who received feedback from RAI. Increased activation was also observed in the caudate body and thalamus, likely representing feedback-related learning. No positive linear trend was observed in the RAI in the group receiving control feedback, suggesting that these data are not a general effect of cognitive strategy or control feedback. The control group did, however, show diffuse activation across the putamen, caudate and posterior insula which may indicate the representation of false feedback. No significant training-related behavioural differences were observed for valence ratings, or SCR. In addition, correlational analyses based on a reinforcement learning model showed that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex underpinned learning in both groups. In summary, these data demonstrate that it is possible to regulate the RAI using rtfMRI-NF within one scanning session, and that such reward-related learning is mediated by the dorsal anterior cingulate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24231399,N,no corr,,,

A border around the face cue location further increased its bottom-up saliency. Before these visual stimuli were shown, one of two tones played: one that predicted a shock (increasing arousal) or one that did not. An arousal-by-saliency interaction in category-specific brain regions (fusiform face area for salient faces and parahippocampal place area for non-salient places) indicated that brain activation associated with processing the salient stimulus was enhanced under arousal whereas activation associated with processing the non-salient stimulus was suppressed under arousal. This is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging study to demonstrate that arousal can enhance information processing for prioritized stimuli while simultaneously impairing processing of non-prioritized stimuli. Thus, it goes beyond previous research to show that arousal does not uniformly enhance perceptual processing, but instead does so selectively in ways that optimizes attention to highly salient stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532703,N,no corr,,,

Animal studies suggest a central role of the amygdala which modulates memory processes in hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and other brain areas. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural correlates of stress-induced modulation of emotional recognition memory in humans. Twenty-seven healthy, right-handed, non-smoker male volunteers performed an emotional face recognition task. During encoding, participants were presented with 50 fearful and 50 neutral faces. One hour later, they underwent either a stress (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control procedure outside the scanner which was followed immediately by the recognition session inside the scanner, where participants had to discriminate between 100 old and 50 new faces. Stress increased salivary cortisol, blood pressure and pulse, and decreased the mood of participants but did not impact recognition memory. BOLD data during recognition revealed a stress condition by emotion interaction in the left inferior frontal gyrus and right hippocampus which was due to a stress-induced increase of neural activity to fearful and a decrease to neutral faces. Functional connectivity analyses revealed a stress-induced increase in coupling between the right amygdala and the right fusiform gyrus, when processing fearful as compared to neutral faces. Our results provide evidence that acute psychosocial stress affects medial temporal and frontal brain areas differentially for neutral and emotional items, with a stress-induced privileged processing of emotional stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402653,N,no corr,,,

Noradrenaline (NA) is involved in memory consolidation, and NAergic innervations are found in brain areas implicated in fear conditioning and extinction. OBJECTIVES: Thus, to enhance extinction memory consolidation through boosted NAergic signalling, we administered 4 mg reboxetine (RBX) immediately after extinction learning (day 2, 24 h after conditioning on day 1) in a randomised, placebo (PLC)-controlled design. At a delayed memory test (day 8), we probed cued and contextual fear and extinction memories before and after a reinstatement manipulation. RESULTS: After reinstatement, we find significantly enhanced amygdala and posterior hippocampus activation in the RBX group, areas implicated in fear memory expression, while the PLC group exhibited enhanced activation in areas associated with extinction memory expression (vmPFC, anterior hippocampus). No group differences were found in skin conductance responses. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our data do not support our hypothesis that enhancement of NA signalling may facilitate extinction memory consolidation and provide preliminary evidence that this might rather enhance fear memories on a neural but not physiological (skin conductance responses) level.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24193372,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2014 Mar 14.","One the one hand, capillary permeability to water is a well-defined concept in microvascular physiology, and linearly relates the net convective or diffusive mass fluxes (by unit area) to the differences in pressure or concentration, respectively, that drive them through the vessel wall. On the other hand, the permeability coefficient is a central parameter introduced when modeling diffusible tracers transfer from blood vessels to tissue in the framework of compartmental models, in such a way that it is implicitly considered as being identical to the capillary permeability. Despite their simplifying assumptions, such models are at the basis of blood flow quantification by H2(15)O Positron Emission Tomgraphy. In the present paper, we use fluid dynamic modeling to compute the transfers of H2(15)O between the blood and brain parenchyma at capillary scale. The analysis of the so-obtained kinetic data by the Renkin-Crone model, the archetypal compartmental model, demonstrates that, in this framework, the permeability coefficient is highly dependent on both flow rate and capillary radius, contrarily to the central hypothesis of the model which states that it is a physiological constant. Thus, the permeability coefficient in Renkin-Crones model is not conceptually identical to the physiologic permeability as implicitly stated in the model. If a permeability coefficient is nevertheless arbitrarily chosen in the computed range, the flow rate determined by the Renkin-Crone model can take highly inaccurate quantitative values. The reasons for this failure of compartmental approaches in the framework of brain blood flow quantification are discussed, highlighting the need for a novel approach enabling to fully exploit the wealth of information available from PET data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637002,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2013 Oct 29.","Depending on threat proximity, different defensive behaviours are mediated by a descending neural network involving forebrain (distal threat) vs midbrain areas (proximal threat). Compared to healthy subjects, it can be assumed that phobics are characterized by shortened defensive distances on a behavioural and neural level. This study aimed at characterizing defensive reactivity in two subtypes of specific phobia [snake (SP) and dental phobics (DP)]. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), n = 39 subjects (13 healthy controls, HC; 13 SP; 13 DP) underwent an event-related fMRI task employing an anticipation (5-10 s) and immediate perception phase (phobic pictures and matched neutral stimuli; 1250 ms) to modulate defensive distance. Although no differential brain activity in any comparisons was observed in DP, areas associated with defensive behaviours (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain) were activated in SP. Decreasing defensive distance in SP was characterized by a shift to midbrain activity. Present findings substantiate differences between phobia types in their physiological and neural organization that can be expanded to early stages of defensive behaviours. Findings may contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic organization of defensive reactivity in different types of phobic fear.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24174207,N,no phys of interest,,,

Perfusion changes can be determined indirectly by evaluation of cerebral blood volume and oxygenation alterations, which can be measured rapidly and non-invasively with the global blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, a magnetic resonance imaging procedure. We assessed acute BOLD responses in OSA subjects to pressor challenges that elicit cerebral blood flow changes, using a two-group comparative design with healthy subjects as a reference. We separately assessed female and male patterns, since OSA characteristics and brain injury differ between sexes. We studied 94 subjects, 37 with newly-diagnosed, untreated OSA (6 female (age mean +/- std: 52.1+/-8.1 yrs; apnea/hypopnea index [AHI]: 27.7+/-15.6 events/hr and 31 male 54.3+/-8.4 yrs; AHI: 37.4+/-19.6 events/hr), and 20 female (age 50.5+/-8.1 yrs) and 37 male (age 45.6+/-9.2 yrs) healthy control subjects. We measured brain BOLD responses every 2 s while subjects underwent cold pressor, hand grip, and Valsalva maneuver challenges. The global BOLD signal rapidly changed after the first 2 s of each challenge, and differed in magnitude between groups to two challenges (cold pressor, hand grip), but not to the Valsalva maneuver (repeated measures ANOVA, p<0.05). OSA females showed greater differences from males in response magnitude and pattern, relative to healthy counterparts. Cold pressor BOLD signal increases (mean +/- adjusted standard error) at the 8 s peak were: OSA 0.14+/-0.08% vs. Control 0.31+/-0.06%, and hand grip at 6 s were: OSA 0.08+/-0.03% vs. Control at 0.30+/-0.02%. These findings, indicative of reduced cerebral blood flow changes to autonomic challenges in OSA, complement earlier reports of altered resting blood flow and reduced cerebral artery responsiveness. Females are more affected than males, an outcome which may contribute to the sex-specific brain injury in the syndrome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25166862,N,clinical,,,

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact within one hour of a single bout of exercise on brain perfusion and neuronal activation. METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 16; age range: 20-35 yrs) were scanned using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) before and after 20 minutes of exercise at 70% of their age-predicted maximal heart rate. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pcASL) was used to measure absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) prior to exercise (pre) and at 10 min (post-10) and 40 min (post-40) post-exercise. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) was performed pre and post-exercise to characterize activation differences related to a go/no-go reaction time task. RESULTS: Compared to pre-exercise levels, grey matter CBF was 11% (+/-9%) lower at post-10 (P<0.0004) and not different at post-40 (P = 0.12), while global WM CBF was increased at both time points post-exercise (P<0.0006). Regionally, the hippocampus and insula showed a decrease in perfusion in ROI-analysis at post-10 (P<0.005, FDR corrected), whereas voxel-wise analysis identified elevated perfusion in the left medial postcentral gyrus at post-40 compared to pre (pcorrected = 0.05). BOLD activations were consistent between sessions, however, the left parietal operculum showed reduced BOLD activation after exercise. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence of regionalized brain effects associated with a single bout of aerobic exercise. The observed acute cerebrovascular responses may provide some insight into the brain's ability to change in relation to chronic interventions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24416356,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2013 Mar 19.","BACKGROUND: Emotional dysregulation is becoming increasingly recognized as an important feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, two experiments were conducted investigating the neural response to either verbally instructed fear (IF) or uninstructed (classically conditioned) fear (UF) using the skin conductance response (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHOD: In the conditioning phase of the UF experiment (17 ADHD and 17 healthy controls), subjects experienced an unconditioned stimulus (UCS, unpleasant electrodermal stimulation) paired with a former neutral conditioned stimulus (CS+), whereas a control stimulus (CS-) was never paired with the UCS. In the subsequent test phase, only the CS+ and the CS- were presented. In the IF experiment (13 ADHD and 17 healthy controls), subjects were only told that an independently experienced UCS might occur together with the CS+ but not the CS- during testing. No UCS was presented. RESULTS: Groups did not detectably differ in SCR or neural responses to UF. In IF, ADHD patients showed a trend-line decreased SCR and significantly decreased activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), a region prominently involved in fear responding, to the CS+. This was accompanied by higher amygdala activation to the CS-. CONCLUSIONS: During IF, ADHD patients showed deficits in regions centrally involved in fear learning and expression in terms of diminished CS+-related dACC and increased CS--related amygdala signals. This suggests an impaired processing of verbally transmitted aversive information, which is central for conveying fear information in social contexts. This result extends the growing literature on emotional alterations in ADHD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510549,N,no corr,,,

In this work, we propose a methodology to investigate autonomic control in carotid stimulation experiments using heartbeat series in combination with fMRI imaging. We modeled cardiovascular signals using the point process model, and processed fMRI data in order to estimate independent components of correlated information.

In the first study, SCWT was used to investigate distraction-induced analgesia in FM patients. Two versions of the task were applied, one with only congruent color-word images and one with incongruent images. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed using a pressure algometer before, during, and following SCWT. In the second study, reaction times (RTs) were assessed and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate cerebral activation patterns in FM patients and HC during the SCWT. An event-related task mixing incongruent and congruent images was used. In study one, we found reduced pressure pain sensitivity during SCWT in both groups alike and no statistically significant differences were seen between the incongruent and congruent conditions. The study two revealed longer RTs during the incongruent compared to the congruent condition in both groups. FM patients had longer RTs than HC in both conditions. Furthermore, we found a significant interaction between group and congruency; that is, the group differences in RTs were more pronounced during the incongruent condition. This was reflected in a reduced activation of the caudate nucleus, lingual gyrus, temporal areas, and the hippocampus in FM patients compared to HC. In conclusion, we found normal pain inhibition during SWTC in FM patients. The cognitive difficulties seen in FM patients, reflected in longer RTs, were related to reduced activation of the caudate nucleus and hippocampus during incongruent SCWT, which most likely affected the mechanisms of cognitive learning in FM patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275449,N,no phys of interest,,,

It has been observed that fear conditioning depends on stimulus salience and subject vulnerability to fear. It is further known that the prevalence of dental-related fear and phobia is exceedingly high in the population. Dental phobia is unique as no other body part is associated with a specific phobia. Therefore, we hypothesized that painful dental stimuli exhibit an enhanced susceptibility to fear conditioning when comparing to equal perceived stimuli applied to other body sites. Differential susceptibility to pain-related fear was investigated by analyzing responses to an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) applied to the right maxillary canine (UCS-c) vs. the right tibia (UCS-t). For fear conditioning, UCS-c and USC-t consisted of painful electric stimuli, carefully matched at both application sites for equal intensity and quality perception. UCSs were paired to simple geometrical forms which served as conditioned stimuli (CS+). Unpaired CS+ were presented for eliciting and analyzing conditioned fear responses. Outcome parameter were (1) skin conductance changes and (2) time-dependent brain activity (BOLD responses) in fear-related brain regions such as the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. A preferential susceptibility of dental pain to fear conditioning was observed, reflected by heightened skin conductance responses and enhanced time-dependent brain activity (BOLD responses) in the fear network. For the first time, this study demonstrates fear-related neurobiological mechanisms that point toward a superior conditionability of tooth pain. Beside traumatic dental experiences our results offer novel evidence that might explain the high prevalence of dental-related fears in the population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25100974,N,no corr,,,

Thus, reward was contingent upon a given level of imagery-induced neural activity using real-time fMRI. We found that the concomitant presentation of reward-related cues during motor imagery not only enhanced neural responses in motivational centers (ventral striatum and extended amygdala) but also exerted a motivational effect in the imagery network itself. Moreover, functional connectivity between ventral striatum (but not extended amygdala) and motor cortex was heightened during imagery in the presence of the reward-related cue.

How the stress hormone cortisol affects brain regions involved in fear extinction in humans is unknown.

In fear acquisition, a picture of a geometrical figure was either partially paired (conditioned stimulus; CS+) or not paired (CS-) with an electrical stimulation (unconditioned stimulus; UCS). In fear extinction, each CS was presented again, but no UCS occurred. Cortisol increased conditioned skin conductance responses in early and late extinction. In early extinction, higher activation towards the CS- than to the CS+ was found in the amygdala, hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal gyrus. This pattern might be associated with the establishment of a new memory trace. In late extinction, the placebo compared with the cortisol group displayed enhanced CS+/CS- differentiation in the amygdala, medial frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. A change from early deactivation to late activation of the extinction circuit as seen in the placebo group seems to be needed to enhance extinction and to reduce fear.

Subjects performed a 10-km race on the same course before and after the intervention period. Training was quantified based on the cumulative time spent in 3 intensity zones: zone 1 (low intensity, <VT), zone 2 (moderate intensity, between VT and RCT), and zone 3 (high intensity, >RCT). The contribution of total training time in each zone was controlled to have more low-intensity training in PET (+/-77/3/20), whereas for BThET the distribution was higher in zone 2 and lower in zone 1 (+/-46/35/19).

However, a subset analysis comparing the 12 runners who actually performed the most PET (n = 6) and BThET (n = 16) distributions showed greater improvement in PET by 1.29 standardized Cohen effect-size units (90% CI 0.31-2.27, P = .038).

Epub 2014 Feb 7.","The locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NA) neuromodulatory system has been implicated in a broad array of cognitive processes, yet scope for investigating this system's function in humans is currently limited by an absence of reliable non-invasive measures of LC activity. Although pupil diameter has been employed as a proxy measure of LC activity in numerous studies, empirical evidence for a relationship between the two is lacking. In the present study, we sought to rigorously probe the relationship between pupil diameter and BOLD activity localized to the human LC. Simultaneous pupillometry and fMRI revealed a relationship between continuous pupil diameter and BOLD activity in a dorsal pontine cluster overlapping with the LC, as localized via neuromelanin-sensitive structural imaging and an LC atlas. This relationship was present both at rest and during performance of a two-stimulus oddball task, with and without spatial smoothing of the fMRI data, and survived retrospective image correction for physiological noise. Furthermore, the spatial extent of this pupil/LC relationship guided a volume-of-interest analysis in which we provide the first demonstration in humans of a fundamental characteristic of animal LC activity: phasic modulation by oddball stimulus relevance. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential for utilizing pupil diameter to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the LC-NA system in human cognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510607,Y,corr,rand,,

A key challenge is to use measured brain-activity patterns to test computational models of brain information processing. One approach to this problem is representational similarity analysis (RSA), which characterizes a representation in a brain or computational model by the distance matrix of the response patterns elicited by a set of stimuli. The representational distance matrix encapsulates what distinctions between stimuli are emphasized and what distinctions are de-emphasized in the representation. A model is tested by comparing the representational distance matrix it predicts to that of a measured brain region. RSA also enables us to compare representations between stages of processing within a given brain or model, between brain and behavioral data, and between individuals and species. Here, we introduce a Matlab toolbox for RSA. The toolbox supports an analysis approach that is simultaneously data- and hypothesis-driven. It is designed to help integrate a wide range of computational models into the analysis of multichannel brain-activity measurements as provided by modern functional imaging and neuronal recording techniques. Tools for visualization and inference enable the user to relate sets of models to sets of brain regions and to statistically test and compare the models using nonparametric inference methods. The toolbox supports searchlight-based RSA, to continuously map a measured brain volume in search of a neuronal population code with a specific geometry. Finally, we introduce the linear-discriminant t value as a measure of representational discriminability that bridges the gap between linear decoding analyses and RSA. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the toolbox, we apply it to both simulated and real fMRI data. The key functions are equally applicable to other modalities of brain-activity measurement. The toolbox is freely available to the community under an open-source license agreement (http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/methods-and-resources/toolboxes/license/).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743308,N,RSA toolbox,,,

Epub 2013 Oct 18.","Stress is thought to alter motivational processes by increasing dopamine (DA) secretion in the brain's ""reward system"", and its key region, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). However, stress studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), mainly found evidence for stress-induced decreases in NAcc responsiveness toward reward cues. Results from both animal and human PET studies indicate that the stress hormone cortisol may be crucial in the interaction between stress and dopaminergic actions. In the present study we therefore investigated whether cortisol mediated the effect of stress on DA-related responses to -subliminal-presentation of reward cues using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), which is known to reliably enhance cortisol levels. Young healthy males (n = 37) were randomly assigned to the TSST or control condition. After stress induction, brain activation was assessed using fMRI during a backward-masking paradigm in which potentially rewarding (sexual), emotionally negative and neutral stimuli were presented subliminally, masked by pictures of inanimate objects. A region of interest analysis showed that stress decreased activation in the NAcc in response to masked sexual cues (voxel-corrected, p<05). Furthermore, with mediation analysis it was found that high cortisol levels were related to stronger NAcc activation, showing that cortisol acted as a suppressor variable in the negative relation between stress and NAcc activation. The present findings indicate that cortisol is crucially involved in the relation between stress and the responsiveness of the reward system. Although generally stress decreases activation in the NAcc in response to rewarding stimuli, high stress-induced cortisol levels suppress this relation, and are associated with stronger NAcc activation. Individuals with a high cortisol response to stress might on one hand be protected against reductions in reward sensitivity, which has been linked to anhedonia and depression, but they may ultimately be more vulnerable to increased reward sensitivity, and addictions. Future studies investigating effects of stress on reward sensitivity should take into account the severity of the stressor and the individual cortisol response to stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24275010,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

In this study, we examined the effects of dehydration on pain thresholds and cortical activations in response to pain, compared with rehydration with an oral rehydration solution (ORS) by functional magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Five healthy adult men were subjected to dehydration and rehydration on 2 different days. The condition on the first day was randomly assigned to each subject. They completed a 40-minute exercise protocol using a walking machine after 12 hours of fasting under both conditions. For rehydration, the subjects consumed up to 3000 mL ORS starting from the night before the test day. After exercise, a painful stimulus (cold pressor test) was applied to the subjects' medial forearm in a magnetic resonance imaging scanning gantry, and pain-evoked brain activation was analyzed. RESULTS: On the rehydration day, each of the subjects consumed an average of 2040 mL (range; 1800-2500 mL) ORS. Physiological data revealed that subjects when dehydrated lost more weight from exercise than subjects when rehydrated had a larger heart rate increase, a higher tympanic temperature, and a higher urine osmolality. Subjective data revealed that the subjects reported significantly stronger thirst while dehydrated than while rehydrated with ORS, although the levels of hunger and anxiety and mood did not significantly differ between conditions. The cold pressor test robustly activated the pain-related neural network, notably the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and thalamus. Such activations in the dehydrated subjects were greater than those in the rehydrated subjects in terms of peak and cluster, accompanied by a decrease in pain threshold (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that dehydration brings about increased brain activity related to painful stimuli together with enhanced thirst, whereas rehydration with ORS alleviates thirst and decreases brain activity related to painful stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24384865,N,no corr,,,

The current study aims to replicate and to expand these findings in a situation where contingency between options and outcomes is manipulated. Sixteen participants performed a stochastic decision-making task in which we manipulated a condition with low uncertainty of gain/loss (contingent-reward condition) and a condition with high uncertainty of gain/loss (random-reward condition). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by (15)O-water positron emission tomography (PET), and cardiovascular parameters and catecholamine in the peripheral blood were measured, during the task. In the contingent-reward condition, norepinephrine as an index of sympathetic activity was positively correlated with entropy indicating exploration in decision-making. Norepinephrine was negatively correlated with neural activity in the right posterior insula, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsal pons, suggesting neural bases for detecting changes of bodily states. Furthermore, right anterior insular activity was negatively correlated with entropy, suggesting influences on exploration in decision-making. By contrast, in the random-reward condition, entropy correlated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices but not with sympathetic activity. These findings suggest that influences of sympathetic activity on exploration in decision-making and its underlying neural mechanisms might be dependent on the degree of uncertainty of situations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25426038,N,no corr,uns,,

Twenty-four healthy human subjects (11 females; age = 24.75 +/- 2.49 years) participated in an affective perceptual load task that manipulated attention to negative/neutral distractor pictures. fMRI data were collected simultaneously with continuous recording of peripheral arterial blood pressure. A parametric modulation analysis examined the impact of attention and emotion on the relation between neural activation and blood pressure reactivity during the task. When attention was available for processing the distractor pictures, negative pictures resulted in behavioral interference, neural activation in brain regions previously related to emotion, a transient decrease of blood pressure, and a positive correlation between blood pressure response and activation in a network including prefrontal and parietal regions, the amygdala, caudate, and mid-brain. These effects were modulated by attention; behavioral and neural responses to highly negative distractor pictures (compared with neutral pictures) were smaller or diminished, as was the negative blood pressure response when the central task involved high perceptual load. Furthermore, comparing high and low load revealed enhanced activation in frontoparietal regions implicated in attention control. Our results fit theories emphasizing the role of attention in the control of behavioral and neural reactions to irrelevant emotional distracting information. Our findings furthermore extend the function of attention to the control of autonomous reactions associated with negative emotions by showing altered blood pressure reactions to emotional stimuli, the latter being of potential clinical relevance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647945,Y,corr,rand,,

Fear conditioning constitutes a valid laboratory model for the acquisition of normal and pathological anxiety. To explore the relationship between disturbed sleep and anxiety in more detail, the present study evaluated the effect of partial sleep deprivation (SD) on fear conditioning in healthy individuals. The neural correlates of 1) nonassociative learning and physiological processing and 2) associative learning (differential fear conditioning) were addressed. Measurements entailed simultaneous functional MRI, EEG, skin conductance response (SCR), and pulse recordings. Regarding nonassociative learning, partial SD resulted in a generalized failure to habituate during fear conditioning, as evidenced by reduced habituation of SCR and hypothalamus responses to all stimuli. Furthermore, SCR and hypothalamus activity were correlated, supporting their functional relationship. Regarding associative learning, effects of partial SD on the acquisition of conditioned fear were weaker and did not reach statistical significance. The hypothalamus plays an integral role in the regulation of sleep and autonomic arousal. Thus sleep disturbances may play a causal role in the development of normal and possibly pathological fear by increasing the susceptibility of the sympathetic nervous system to stressful experiences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920020,N,components not coorda,uns,,

In this fMRI mental tracking paradigm, we looked at the effects of focusing one's attention internally (interoception) vs. externally (exteroception) in a well-studied group at risk for PD-that is anxiety-sensitive females (AS-high). We hypothesized that AS-high subjects compared to control subjects will present higher arousal and decreased valence scores during interoception and parallel higher activity in brain areas which are associated with fear and interoception. 24 healthy female students with high levels of anxiety sensitivity and 24 healthy female students with normal levels of anxiety sensitivity serving as control group were investigated by 3 T fMRI. Subjects either focused their attention on their heartbeats (internal condition) or on neutral tones (external condition). Task performance was monitored by reporting the number of heartbeats or tones after each block. State of arousal and emotional valence were also assessed. The high anxiety-sensitive group reported higher arousal scores compared to controls during the course of the experiment. Simultaneously, fMRI results indicated higher activation in anxiety-sensitive participants than in controls during interoception in a network of cortical and subcortical brain regions (thalamus, amygdala, parahippocampus) that overlaps with known fear circuitry structures. In particular, the activity of the right amygdala was up-regulated. Future prospective-longitudinal studies are needed to validate the role of the amygdala for transition to disorder.

Epub 2014 Feb 27.","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the magnitude of anti-nociceptive effects induced by heterotopic noxious counter-stimulation (HNCS) and the basal mu-opioid receptor availability in the amygdala. In 8 healthy volunteers (4 females and 4 males), transcutaneous electrical stimulation was applied to the right sural nerve to produce the nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII-reflex), moderate pain, and scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Immersion of the left hand in cold water for 20min was used as HNCS. In a separate session, basal mu-opioid receptor availability was measured using positron emission tomography with the radiotracer [(11)C]carfentanil. HNCS produced a reduction of the P260 amplitude (p<0.05), a late component of SEP that reflects activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. This reduction was associated with higher basal mu-opioid receptor availability in the amygdala on the right (R(2)=0.55, p=0.03) with a similar trend on the left (R(2)=0.24, p=0.22). Besides, HNCS did not induce significant changes in pain and RIII-reflex amplitude (p>0.05). These results suggest that activation of mu-opioid receptors in the amygdala may contribute to the anti-nociceptive effects of HNCS. The lack of RIII-reflex modulation further suggests that mu-opioid receptor activation in the amygdala contributes to decrease pain-related brain activity through a cerebral mechanism independent of descending modulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583336,N,no phys of interest,,,

This study aimed to characterize synchrony in resting state cerebral networks in both pre-HD and symp-HD populations and to determine its association with disease burden and neurocognitive functions. METHODS: We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from pre-HD, symp-HD and healthy control participants. The fMRI data were analyzed using multisubject independent component analysis and dual regression. We compared networks of interest among the groups using a nonparametric permutation method and correcting for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Our study included 25 people in the pre-HD, 23 in the symp-HD and 18 in the healthy control groups. Compared with the control group, the pre-HD group showed decreased synchrony in the sensorimotor and dorsal attention networks; decreased level of synchrony in the sensorimotor network was associated with poorer motor performance. Compared with the control group, the symp-HD group showed widespread reduction in synchrony in the dorsal attention network, which was associated with poorer cognitive performance. The posterior putamen and superior parietal cortex were functionally disconnected from the frontal executive network in the symp-HD compared with control and pre-HD groups. Furthermore, the left frontoparietal network showed areas of increased synchrony in the symp-HD compared with the pre-HD group. LIMITATIONS: We could not directly correct for influence of autonomic changes (e.g., heart rate) and respiration on resting state synchronization. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that aberrant synchrony in the sensorimotor and dorsal attention networks may serve as an early signature of neural change in pre-HD individuals. The altered synchrony in dorsal attention, frontoparietal and corticostriatal networks may contribute to the development of clinical symptoms in people with Huntington disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083458,N,no corr,,,

We use magnetic resonance imaging techniques to investigate the anatomical distribution of cerebrovascular reactivity changes in patients with OSAS, as well as their evolution after therapeutic and sham continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. METHODS: Twenty-three men with moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea were compared to a healthy control group (n=7) using a breath-holding functional magnetic resonance imaging task and the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) imaging before and after 2 months of therapeutic (active) or sub-therapeutic (sham) CPAP treatment.

Cerebrovascular reactivity increased with therapeutic CPAP in the thalamus and decreased with sham CPAP in medial frontal regions in OSAS patients. Duration of nocturnal hypoxemia and body mass index negatively correlated with cerebrovascular reactivity, particularly in the medial temporal lobe structures, suggesting a possible pathophysiological mechanism for hippocampal injury. There was no difference in perfusion between patients and control group, and no effect of CPAP or sham-CPAP treatment on perfusion in patients.

However, the occurrence of 'slow sinusoidal hemodynamic oscillations' (SSHOs) in human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies is rarely noted or considered. As a result, little investigation into the cause of SSHOs has been undertaken, and their potential to confound fMRI analysis, as well as their possible value as a functional biomarker has been largely overlooked. Here, we report direct observation of large-amplitude, sinusoidal ~0.1 Hz hemodynamic oscillations in the cortex of an awake human undergoing surgical resection of a brain tumor. Intraoperative multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) revealed that SSHOs were spatially localized to distinct regions of the cortex, exhibited wave-like propagation, and involved oscillations in the diameter of specific pial arterioles, indicating that the effect was not the result of systemic blood pressure oscillations. fMRI data collected from the same subject 4 days prior to surgery demonstrates that ~0.1 Hz oscillations in the BOLD signal can be detected around the same region. Intraoperative optical imaging data from a patient undergoing epilepsy surgery, in whom sinusoidal oscillations were not observed, is shown for comparison. This direct observation of the '0.1 Hz wave' in the awake human brain, using both intraoperative imaging and pre-operative fMRI, confirms that SSHOs occur in the human brain, and can be detected by fMRI. We discuss the possible physiological basis of this oscillation and its potential link to brain pathologies, highlighting its relevance to resting-state fMRI and its potential as a novel target for functional diagnosis and delineation of neurological disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24185013,N,methods paper,,,

Evidence that these regions are not only activated but also function as networks during empathic experience has yet to been shown. Employing a novel approach by analyzing fMRI fluctuations of network cohesion while viewing films portraying personal loss, this study demonstrates increased connectivity during empathic engagement (probed by behavioral and parasympathetic indices) both within these circuits, and between them and a set of limbic regions. Notably, this effect was context-dependent: when witnessing as a determined-loss presented as a future event, the ToM and ToM-limbic cohesion positively correlated with state- and empathy indices. During the dramatic peak of this condition, the ToM cohesion was positively correlated with the trait-empathy index of personal distress. However, when the loss was presented as a probabilistic real-time occurrence, ToM cohesion negatively correlated with state-empathy index, which positively correlated with ES-limbic cohesion. In this case, it was the ES-limbic cohesion during the emotional peak which was correlated with personal distress scores.

All but one panic attack that happened during this task occurred in risk allele carriers and, furthermore, risk allele carriers did not habituate to the situation during repetitive exposure. Finally, functional neuroimaging during a classical fear conditioning paradigm evidenced that the protective allele is associated with increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex upon presentation of the CS+ during acquisition of fear. Further differentiation between high- and low-risk subjects after treatment was observed in the inferior parietal lobes, suggesting differential brain activation patterns upon CBT. Taken together, we established that a genetic risk factor for PD/AG is associated with worse response to CBT and identify potential underlying neural mechanisms. These findings might govern how psychotherapy can include genetic information to tailor individualized treatment approaches.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319006,N,clinical,,,

We tested the hypothesis that cholinergic vasodilatation is important for the increase in rCBF during cerebral activation. The subjects were 11 young healthy males at an age of 24 +/- 3 years (mean +/- SD). We used arterial spin labeling and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate rCBF with and without intravenous glycopyrrolate during a handgrip motor task and visual stimulation. Glycopyrrolate increased heart rate from 56 +/- 9 to 114 +/- 14 beats/min (mean +/- SD; p < 0.001), mean arterial pressure from 86 +/- 8 to 92 +/- 12 mmHg, and cardiac output from 5.6 +/- 1.4 to 8.0 +/- 1.7 l/min. Glycopyrrolate had, however, no effect on the arterial spin labeling or BOLD responses to the handgrip motor task or to visual stimulation. This study indicates that during a handgrip motor task and visual stimulation, the increase in rCBF is unaffected by blockade of acetylcholine receptors by glycopyrrolate.

Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 13 patients who underwent a hypoglossal-facial transfer after unilateral peripheral facial palsy. To identify primary motor and somatosensory tongue and lip representation sites, we measured repetitive tongue and lip movements during fMRI. Electromyography (EMG) of the perioral muscles during tongue and lip movements and standardized evaluation of lip elevation served as outcome parameters. We found an association of cortical representation sites in the pre- and postcentral gyrus (decreased distance of lip and tongue representation) with symmetry of recovered lip movements (lip elevation) and coactivation of the lip during voluntary tongue movements (EMG-activity of the lip during tongue movements).

METHODS: One hundred eighty-two community-dwelling older women (mean age [SD], 69.4 [6.6] years) without disability in instrumental activities of daily living and without mobility limitations underwent positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose at rest to assess brain activity associated with gait function. We measured normalized-rCMRglc in 16 regions of interest. Within 6 months of the positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose scan, gait speed, step length, and step frequency both at comfortable and maximum paces were measured as indices of gait function. Associations between normalized-rCMRglc and gait indices were examined with multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for demographic characteristics, including age, height, body weight, blood pressure, past illness, and education. RESULTS: Slower maximum gait speed even in the range of individual difference was associated with lower normalized-rCMRglc in the prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and parietal cortices. Lower step frequency at the maximum pace was also associated with lower normalized-rCMRglc in these regions. However, there was no significant association between step length at the maximum pace and normalized-rCMRglc or between all gait variables at a comfortable pace and normalized-rCMRglc. CONCLUSIONS: The normalized-rCMRglc values in specific regions were associated with individual differences in gait function, even in healthy older women. These regions of the cerebrum could play an important role in gait control.

We hypothesized that impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and incident glucose disorders have detrimental effects on global cognition and brain volume. We further hypothesized that metabolic and inflammatory derangements accompanying hyperglycaemia contribute to change in brain structure and function. This was a longitudinal study of a community-dwelling elderly cohort with neuropsychological testing (n = 880) and brain volumes by magnetic resonance imaging (n = 312) measured at baseline and 2 years. Primary outcomes were global cognition and total brain volume. Secondary outcomes were cognitive domains (processing speed, memory, language, visuospatial and executive function) and brain volumes (hippocampal, parahippocampal, precuneus and frontal lobe). Participants were categorised as normal, impaired fasting glucose at both assessments (stable IFG), baseline diabetes or incident glucose disorders (incident diabetes or IFG at 2 years). Measures included inflammatory cytokines and oxidative metabolites. Covariates were age, sex, education, non-English speaking background, smoking, blood pressure, lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications, mood score, apolipoprotein E genotype and baseline cognition or brain volume. Participants with incident glucose disorders had greater decline in global cognition and visuospatial function compared to normal, similar to that observed in baseline diabetes. Homocysteine was independently associated with the observed effect of diabetes on executive function. Apolipoprotein E genotype did not influence the observed effects of diabetes on cognition. Incident glucose disorders and diabetes were also associated with greater 2-year decline in total brain volume, compared to normal (40.0 +/- 4.2 vs. 46.7 +/- 5.7 mm(3) vs. 18.1 +/- 6.2, respectively, p < 0.005). Stable IFG did not show greater decline in global cognition or brain volumes compared to normal. Incident glucose disorders, like diabetes, are associated with accelerated decline in global cognition and brain volumes in non-demented elderly, whereas stable IFG is not.

However, normative and phobic fear are rarely contrasted directly, thus the degree to which these two types of fear elicit similar neural and bodily responses is not well understood. To examine biological correlates of normal and phobic fear, 21 snake phobic and 21 nonphobic controls saw videos of slithering snakes, attacking snakes and fish in an event-related fMRI design. Simultaneous eletrodermal, pupillary, and self-reported affective responses were collected. Nonphobic fear activated a network of threat-responsive brain regions and involved pupillary dilation, electrodermal response and self-reported affect selective to the attacking snakes. Phobic fear recruited a large array of brain regions including those active in normal fear plus additional structures and also engendered increased pupil dilation, electrodermal and self-reported responses that were greater to any snake versus fish. Importantly, phobics showed greater between- and within-subject concordance among neural, electrodermal, pupillary, and subjective report measures. These results suggest phobic responses recruit overlapping but more strongly activated and more extensive networks of brain activity as compared to normative fear, and are characterized by greater concordance among neural activation, peripheral physiology and self-report. It is yet unclear whether concordance is unique to psychopathology, or rather simply an indicator of the intense fear seen in the phobic response, but these results underscore the importance of synchrony between brain, body, and cognition during the phobic reaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561099,N,phobics only,,,

Brown adipose tissue is activated by cold exposure and stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system. We therefore examined the effect of hypoglycemia on uptake of the labeled glucose analogue (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose in brown adipose tissue using positron emission tomography and computer tomography. METHODS: In nine healthy adults (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake as measure of brown adipose tissue activity was assessed in a cold environment (17 degrees C) during euglycemia (blood glucose 4.5 mmol/L) and hypoglycemia (2.5 mmol/L) using a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp. RESULTS: Brown adipose tissue activity was observed in all participants. No difference was observed in the median (range) maximal standardized uptake values of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose in brown adipose tissue between euglycemia and hypoglycemia: 4.2 (1.0-7.7) versus 3.1 (2.2-12.5) g/mL (p=0.7). Similarly there were no differences in mean standardized (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake values or total brown adipose tissue volume between euglycemia and hypoglycemia. Body temperature dropped by 0.6 degrees C from baseline during the hypoglycemic condition and remained unchanged during the euglycemic condition. There was no correlation between the maximal standardized uptake values of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose in brown adipose tissue and levels of counterregulatory hormones. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is a similar amount of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in brown adipose tissue during hypoglycemia when compared to euglycemia, which makes a role for systemic catecholamines in brown adipose tissue activation and a role for brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in hypoglycemia associated hypothermia unlikely.

Additionally, we evaluated empathic abilities to test the association between interoception and emotional experience. The results showed patient's impaired performance in the heartbeat detection task when compared to controls.

He also presented a particular pattern of impairments in affective empathy. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental research that assesses the relationship between interoception and DD combining behavioral and neurobiological measures.

Ten depressed and ten control subjects performed an emotional counting Stroop task designed to trigger affective change in the attentional background while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and concurrent electrocardiography (ECG) on four occasions: week 0 (pre-treatment) and weeks 2, 6 and 12 of treatment on sertraline. We measured the absolute value of change between adjacent emotional and neutral conditions in both VC and the BOLD signal in specific regions of the MVN. Over time consistent increases were observed in BOLD-VC magnitude correlations in depressed subjects in subgenual ACC and left DLPFC, which strongly correlated with depressive symptom improvement. Symptom improvement over time was also associated with decreases in the magnitude of both BOLD shifts and VC shifts within-subjects.

In this work, we aim to assess the test-retest reproducibility and inter-subject variability of BOLD CVR measurements obtained using a PDB task and different methods to analyse the associated BOLD signal. The respiratory protocol consisted of alternating 40s of PDB with normal free breathing; expired CO2 pressure levels (PETCO2) were continuously monitored. CVR was quantified using either a timecourse curve analysis (TCA) approach, where the magnitude of response peaks is emphasized, or general linear modelling (GLM) including optimisation of the BOLD response latencies. The GLM fit was carried out using two types of response regressors: one that was computed as the convolution of PETCO2 traces with a gamma function and another that consisted of the convolution of PDB paradigm blocks with a physiological model of the respiratory response. Haemodynamic response latencies were optimised either on a voxel basis or for the whole imaging region. We found that the GLM method based on PDB task or PETCO2 traces and voxelwise optimisation of response latencies provided the most reproducible measures of CVR. For the average grey matter CVR, the inter-subject coefficient of variation (CVinter) / intra-subject coefficient of variation (CVintra) / intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were 20%/8%/0.8 and 27%/8%/0.9, using the task and PETCO2 timecourses, respectively. In terms of the spatial reproducibility, the group mean (+/-standard deviation) of the spatial ICC (ICCspatial) was 1.04+/-0.23 and 1.02+/-0.26, for the task and PETCO2 timecourses, respectively. These results indicate generally good reproducibility of the hypocapnic CVR maps obtained using the proposed PDB task and analysis methodology.

Here we present a new means of resolving this spatial organization using a combination of non-invasive observables (EEG, MEG, and MRI), model-based estimates of spectrotemporal patterns of neural activation, and multivariate pattern analysis. The method exploits both the fine-grained temporal patterning of auditory cortical responses and the millisecond scale temporal resolution of EEG and MEG. Participants listened to 400 English words while MEG and scalp EEG were measured simultaneously. We estimated the location of cortical sources using the MRI anatomically constrained minimum norm estimate (MNE) procedure. We then combined a form of multivariate pattern analysis (representational similarity analysis) with a spatiotemporal searchlight approach to successfully decode information about patterns of neuronal frequency preference and selectivity in bilateral superior temporal cortex. Observed frequency preferences in and around Heschl's gyrus matched current proposals for the organization of tonotopic gradients in primary acoustic cortex, while the distribution of narrow frequency selectivity similarly matched results from the fMRI literature. The spatial maps generated by this novel combination of techniques seem comparable to those that have emerged from fMRI or ECOG studies, and a considerable advance over earlier MEG results.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25429257,N,structural,,,

METHODS: Eighteen EH patients were divided into a twisting acupuncture group (10 cases) and a sham acupuncture group (8 cases), which were treated with twisting manipulation and sham acu- puncture at right Taichong (LR 3), respectively. The treatments were both given with 30-second manipulation and 30- second interval for totally 5 min. During the acupuncture, fMRI was adopted to scan the cerebral function imaging of EH patients on resting state, and the acquired data were analyzed with SPM2 module in Matlab software. RESULTS: Acupunc- ture at Taichong (LR 3) in EH patients mainly increased opposite-side oxygen consumption, which generally activated left anterior cingulated gyrus (BA 32), left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), left inferior temporal gyrus (BA 19), left middle temporal gyrus (BA 37) and right anterior central gyrus (BA 6). The activated areas were related to motor, vision and cognition of emotion. Stimulation region of sham acupuncture mainly included right anterior cingulated gyrus (BA 24), left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 7). CONCLUSION: The central mechanism of Tai- chong (LR 3) on antihypertensive effect and symptom improvement is not in thalamus and medulla that are traditionally believed to control blood pressure. Taichong (LR 3) could activate anterior cingulated gyrus to regulate parasympathetic nerve and lower blood pressure, and through anterior cingulated gyrus, the connection with the surrounding areas is strengthened to improve the cognitive impairment caused by long-term hypertension.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25876351,M,acupuncture,,,

Additionally, we evaluated the association of objectively measured stress with self-reported burnout symptoms. METHODS: Participants of this cross-sectional study were 81 healthy males (age range 26-40 y). Stress and recovery on workdays were measured objectively based on HRV recordings. CRF and anthropometry were assessed in laboratory conditions. The level of PA was based on a detailed PA interview (MET index [MET-h/d]) and self-reported activity class. RESULTS: PA, CRF, and body composition were significantly associated with levels of stress and recovery on workdays. MET index (P < 0.001), activity class (P = 0.001), and CRF (P = 0.019) were negatively associated with stress during working hours whereas body fat percentage (P = 0.005) was positively associated. Overall, 27.5% of the variance of total stress on workdays (P = 0.001) was accounted for by PA, CRF, and body composition. Body fat percentage and body mass index were negatively associated with night-time recovery whereas CRF was positively associated. Objective work stress was associated (P = 0.003) with subjective burnout symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: PA, CRF, and body composition are associated with HRV-based stress and recovery levels, which needs to be taken into account in the measurement, prevention, and treatment of work-related stress. The HRV-based method used to determine work-related stress and recovery was associated with self-reported burnout symptoms, but more research on the clinical importance of the methodology is needed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742265,N,no brain data,,,

It is currently under debate whether pathological buying can be considered a behavioral addiction. In analogy to results reported in addicted individuals, craving reactions elicited by addiction-related cues might be an underlying mechanism for the etiology and pathogenesis of pathological buying. METHODS: In the present study, 30 pathological buyers and 30 matched control participants were examined with a cue-reactivity paradigm consisting of shopping and control cues. Skin conductance responses, as well as subjective ratings for arousal, valence, and urge to buy, were assessed. Subjective craving reactions were measured before and after the cue-reactivity paradigm. RESULTS: On a physiological level, skin conductance responses toward shopping cues were higher in pathological buyers (mean [M; standard deviation {SD}] = 0.26 [0.13]) compared with control participants (M [SD] = 0.19 [0.09]; t(58) = 2.29, p = .025, d = 0.60). On a behavioral level, the individuals with pathological buying rated the shopping cues as more arousing and more positive, and reported a greater urge to buy compared with control participants and with control cues. An increase in subjective craving after completing the cue-reactivity paradigm was observed only in the pathological buyers (Mpre [SD] = 1.95 [1.47], Mpost [SD] = 2.87 [1.79]; t(29) = 5.07, p < .001, d = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Cue-reactivity and craving might be potential correlates for the development and maintenance of pathological buying.

In depression patients who do not exhibit risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease and dementia, particularly in young people, inflammation is a likely risk factor for depression. We explored whether chronic osteomyelitis (COM), a chronic inflammatory disease, increases depression risk. METHODS: A Taiwanese national insurance claims data set of more than 22 million enrollees was used to select 15,529 COM patients without depression history and 62,116 randomly selected age- and gender-matched controls without depression and COM history to trace depression development for an 12-year follow-up period from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2010. The depression risk was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: The above-mentioned risk factors for depression were more frequent in the COM cohort, who exhibited significantly higher depression risk than the control group did. Comparing only those without comorbidities, the COM group exhibited higher depression risk than the control group did (hazard ratio [HR]=3.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.55-3.62). The younger population carried even greater risk (age<45: HR=6.08, 95% CI: 1.71-7.85; age>65: HR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.39-2.19).

These heart rate/fMRI associations may influence the results of brain activation studies, particularly if heart rate is affected by the task. To assess the contribution of task-related heart rate changes on fMRI brain activation related to executive processing, we co-registered the electrocardiogram with fMRI in 91 subjects during an interference task (color-word Stroop) and during a planning task (Tower of London; ToL). We found that both Stroop interference and ToL planning significantly increased heart rate in the scanner and confirmed significant main effects of heart rate regressors on the fMRI signals. Nevertheless, statistical contrasts that test for increased fMRI during Stroop interference and ToL planning were not significantly influenced by inclusion of heart rate regressors. We conclude therefore that fMRI changes associated with heart rate changes do not impact strongly on higher-order fMRI effects in these commonly used executive function tasks, but routinely adding a correction seems prudent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768574,M,just uns,uns,,

Presented on screen, it generates illusionary forward self-motion, pointing at a close vision-gait interrelation. As particularly parkinsonian gait is vulnerable to external stimuli, effects of optic flow on motor-related cerebral circuitry were explored with functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls (HC) and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Fifteen HC and 22 PD patients, of which 7 experienced freezing of gait (FOG), watched wide-field flow, interruptions by narrowing or deceleration and equivalent control conditions with static dots. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that wide-field flow interruption evoked activation of the (pre-)supplementary motor area (SMA) in HC, which was decreased in PD. During wide-field flow, dorsal occipito-parietal activations were reduced in PD relative to HC, with stronger functional connectivity between right visual motion area V5, pre-SMA and cerebellum (in PD without FOG). Non-specific 'changes' in stimulus patterns activated dorsolateral fronto-parietal regions and the fusiform gyrus. This attention-associated network was stronger activated in HC than in PD. PD patients thus appeared compromised in recruiting medial frontal regions facilitating internally generated virtual locomotion when visual motion support falls away. Reduced dorsal visual and parietal activations during wide-field optic flow in PD were explained by impaired feedforward visual and visuomotor processing within a magnocellular (visual motion) functional chain. Compensation of impaired feedforward processing by distant fronto-cerebellar circuitry in PD is consistent with motor responses to visual motion stimuli being either too strong or too weak. The 'change'-related activations pointed at covert (stimulus-driven) attention.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755754,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Here, we establish for the first time the neurochemical specificity of such drug effects, during reward and punishment learning in humans, by adopting a coadministration design. Participants (N = 22) were scanned on 4 occasions using functional magnetic resonance imaging, following intake of placebo, bromocriptine (dopamine-receptor agonist), sulpiride (dopamine-receptor antagonist), or a combination of both drugs. A reversal-learning task was employed, in which both unexpected rewards and punishments signaled reversals. Drug effects were stratified with baseline working memory to take into account individual variations in drug response. Sulpiride induced parallel span-dependent changes on striatal blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during unexpected rewards and punishments. These drug effects were found to be partially dopamine-dependent, as they were blocked by coadministration with bromocriptine. In contrast, sulpiride elicited opposite effects on behavioral measures of reward and punishment learning. Moreover, sulpiride-induced increases in striatal BOLD signal during both outcomes were associated with behavioral improvement in reward versus punishment learning. These results provide a strong support for current theories, suggesting that drug effects on reward and punishment learning are mediated via striatal dopamine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23183711,N,no phys of interest,,,

We investigated possible neuroanatomical underpinnings of the beneficial effects of yoga using sensory testing and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. North American yogis tolerated pain more than twice as long as individually matched controls and had more gray matter (GM) in multiple brain regions. Across subjects, insular GM uniquely correlated with pain tolerance. Insular GM volume in yogis positively correlated with yoga experience, suggesting a causal relationship between yoga and insular size. Yogis also had increased left intrainsular white matter integrity, consistent with a strengthened insular integration of nociceptive input and parasympathetic autonomic regulation. Yogis, as opposed to controls, used cognitive strategies involving parasympathetic activation and interoceptive awareness to tolerate pain, which could have led to use-dependent hypertrophy of insular cortex. Together, these findings suggest that regular and long-term yoga practice improves pain tolerance in typical North Americans by teaching different ways to deal with sensory inputs and the potential emotional reactions attached to those inputs leading to a change in insular brain anatomy and connectivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23696275,N,structural,,,

We compared the subjective, cardiovascular, and brain DA responses (measured with PET and [(11)C]raclopride) to MP between controls and marijuana abusers. Although baseline (placebo) measures of striatal DA D2 receptor availability did not differ between groups, the marijuana abusers showed markedly blunted responses when challenged with MP.

In ventral striatum (key brain reward region), MP-induced reductions in DVs and BPND (reflecting DA increases) were inversely correlated with scores of negative emotionality, which were significantly higher for marijuana abusers than controls. In marijuana abusers, DA responses in ventral striatum were also inversely correlated with addiction severity and craving. The attenuated responses to MP, including reduced decreases in striatal DVs, are consistent with decreased brain reactivity to the DA stimulation in marijuana abusers that might contribute to their negative emotionality (increased stress reactivity and irritability) and addictive behaviors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25024177,N,no phys of interest,,,

LST significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscle (5.0%, P<0.001) and isometric and isokinetic knee extension strengths (P<0.05). CON failed to increase muscle size (1.1%, P = 0.12), but significantly improved its strength (P<0.05). These results indicate that even if the intensity is as low as 30% 1RM, LST can increase muscle size and strength in healthy older adults.

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We performed PMRS in bilateral anterior insulae using a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner, calculated N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr), choline/creatine (Cho/Cr), myo-inositol/creatine (MI/Cr), and MI/NAA metabolite ratios, and examined daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and neuropsychologic status (Beck Depression Inventory II [BDI-II] and Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]). Body mass index, BAI, BDI-II, PSQI, and ESS significantly differed between groups. NAA/ Cr ratios were significantly reduced bilaterally, and left-sided MI/Cr and MI/NAA ratios were increased in OSA over controls. Significant positive correlations emerged between left insular MI/Cr ratios and apnea-hypopnea index values, right insular Cho/Cr ratios and BDI-II and BAI scores, and negative correlations appeared between left insular NAA/Cr ratios and PSQI scores and between right-side MI/Cr ratios and baseline and nadir change in O2 saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with obstructive sleep apnea showed bilaterally reduced N-acetylaspartate and left-side increased myo-inositol anterior insular metabolites, indicating neuronal damage and increased glial activation, respectively, which may contribute to abnormal autonomic and neuropsychologic functions in the condition. The activated glial status likely indicates increased inflammatory action that may induce more neuronal injury, and suggests separate approaches for glial and neuronal protection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24790274,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2013 Apr 24.","Neuroimaging studies show a correlation between activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and skin conductance measurements. However, little is known whether this brain region plays a causal role in regulating physiological arousal. To address this question, we employed Granger causality analysis (GCA) to establish causality between cerebral blood oxygenation level-dependent and skin conductance signals in 24 healthy adults performing a cognitive task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results showed that activity of the vmPFC not only negatively correlated with skin conductance level (SCL) but also Granger caused SCL, thus establishing the direction of influence. Importantly, across participants, the strength of Granger causality was negatively correlated to phasic skin conductance responses elicited by external events during the behavioral task. In contrast, activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex positively correlated with SCL but did not show a causal relationship in GCA. These new findings indicate that the vmPFC plays a causal role in regulating physiological arousal. Increased vmPFC activity leads to a decrease in skin conductance. The findings may also advance our understanding of dysfunctions of the vmPFC in mood and anxiety disorders that involve altered control of physiological arousal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23620600,Y,corr,rand,,

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying these physiological and psychological changes, it is critical to investigate the effects of microgravity on the functional architecture of the brain. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study whether the functional architecture of the brain is altered after 45 days of -6 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a reliable model for the simulation of microgravity. Sixteen healthy male volunteers underwent rs-fMRI scans before and after 45 days of -6 degrees HDT bed rest. Specifically, we used a commonly employed graph-based measure of network organization, i.e., degree centrality (DC), to perform a full-brain exploration of the regions that were influenced by simulated microgravity. We subsequently examined the functional connectivities of these regions using a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis. We found decreased DC in two regions, the left anterior insula (aINS) and the anterior part of the middle cingulate cortex (MCC; also called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in many studies), in the male volunteers after 45 days of -6 degrees HDT bed rest. Furthermore, seed-based RSFC analyses revealed that a functional network anchored in the aINS and MCC was particularly influenced by simulated microgravity. These results provide evidence that simulated microgravity alters the resting-state functional architecture of the brains of males and suggest that the processing of salience information, which is primarily subserved by the aINS-MCC functional network, is particularly influenced by spaceflight. The current findings provide a new perspective for understanding the relationships between microgravity, cognitive function, autonomic neural function, and central neural activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926242,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Animal studies suggest that the neural circuitry responsible fear renewal includes the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsomedial (dmPFC) and ventromedial (vmPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, the neural mechanisms of context-dependent fear renewal in humans remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), combined with psychophysiology and immersive virtual reality, to elucidate how the hippocampus, amygdala, and dmPFC and vmPFC interact to drive the context-dependent renewal of extinguished fear. Healthy human participants encountered dynamic fear-relevant conditioned stimuli (CSs) while navigating through 3-D virtual reality environments in the MRI scanner. Conditioning and extinction were performed in two different virtual contexts. Twenty-four hours later, participants were exposed to the CSs without reinforcement while navigating through both contexts in the MRI scanner. Participants showed enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs) to the previously-reinforced CS+ in the acquisition context on Day 2, consistent with fear renewal, and sustained responses in the dmPFC. In contrast, participants showed low SCRs to the CSs in the extinction context on Day 2, consistent with extinction recall, and enhanced vmPFC activation to the non-reinforced CS-. Structural equation modeling revealed that the dmPFC fully mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during fear renewal, whereas the vmPFC partially mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during extinction recall.

However, it is unclear how these processes are instantiated at a neural level. Prior research suggests that individuals prone to anxiety may have exaggerated activity in the anterior insula and altered activity in the cingulate cortex during anticipation of aversive events. Thus, we hypothesized that anxiety proneness influences anterior insula activation during anticipation of unpredictable threat through decreased perceived control. Forty physically healthy adults underwent neuroimaging while they explored computer-simulated contexts associated either with or without the threat of an unpredictable shock. Skin conductance, anxiety ratings and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess responses to threat versus no threat. Perceived control was measured using the Anxiety Control Questionnaire-Revised. Mediation analysis examined how anxiety proneness influenced BOLD activity. Anticipation of unpredictable threat resulted in increased skin conductance responses, anxiety ratings and enhanced activation in bilateral insula, anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Individuals with greater anxiety proneness and less perceived control showed greater activity in dorsal anterior insula (dAI). Perceived control mediated the relationship between anxiety proneness and dAI activity. Increased dAI activity was associated with increased activity in aMCC, which correlated with increased exploratory behavior. Results provide evidence that exaggerated insula activation during the threat of unpredictable shock is directly related to low perceived control in anxiety-prone individuals. Perceived control thus may constitute an important treatment target to modulate insula activity during anxious anticipation in anxiety-disordered individuals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26125154,Y,corr,uns,,

For contextual fear acquisition, we paired one context (CS+) with an aversive electrical stimulus, whereas the other (CS-) was never followed by aversive stimulation. Blood oxygen level dependent activation to the CS+ was present in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior medial gyrus and caudate nucleus. Furthermore, the amygdala and hippocampus were involved in a time-dependent manner. Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed functional connectivity of a more posterior hippocampal seed region with the anterior hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior parietal lobule.

The basis of emotional impairment is still poorly understood and explicit (emotion appraisal) and implicit (autonomic system activity) responses have not been carefully evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We investigated explicit evaluation of emotions by testing valence and arousal using self-report measures and we also assessed automatic responses to emotional cues, using autonomic measures (skin conductance response and heart rate). METHODS: 16 behavioral variant FTD and 12 agrammatic variants of primary progressive aphasia patients were included. The performance of these patients was compared to a group of 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 20 healthy controls. Each subject was required to observe and evaluate affective pictures while autonomic parameters were recorded. RESULTS: FTD patients preserved a functional general competency in terms of valence (correct positive versus negative attribution) and arousal (correct dichotomy between high versus low arousal category) distinction. These patients showed significant changes in autonomic implicit response compared to the other groups. The mismatch between explicit and implicit responsiveness to emotional cues was found both in behavioral variant FTD and in agrammatic variants of primary progressive aphasia. Emotional responsiveness was related to the severity of behavioral abnormalities as measured by the Frontal Behavioral Inventory and associated with atrophy of the left putamen. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that FTD patients are able to explicitly ""appraise"" the emotion, but they cannot implicitly ""feel"" the emotion. This mismatch between the two levels may help explain the general emotional behavior impairment found in these patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25757651,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2014 Dec 15.","KEY POINTS: Both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and skeletal muscle activation contribute to the metabolic response of acute cold exposure in healthy men even under minimal shivering. Activation of adipose tissue intracellular lipolysis is associated with BAT metabolic response upon acute cold exposure in healthy men. Although BAT glucose uptake per volume of tissue is important, the bulk of glucose turnover during cold exposure is mediated by skeletal muscle metabolic activation even when shivering is minimized. ABSTRACT: Cold exposure stimulates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), triggering the activation of cold-defence responses and mobilizing substrates to fuel the thermogenic processes. Although these processes have been investigated independently, the physiological interaction and coordinated contribution of the tissues involved in producing heat or mobilizing substrates has never been investigated in humans. Using [U-(13)C]-palmitate and [3-(3)H]-glucose tracer methodologies coupled with positron emission tomography using (11)C-acetate and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, we examined the relationship between whole body sympathetically induced white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis and brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism and mapped the skeletal muscle shivering and metabolic activation pattern during a mild, acute cold exposure designed to minimize shivering response in 12 lean healthy men. Cold-induced increase in whole-body oxygen consumption was not independently associated with BAT volume of activity, BAT oxidative metabolism, or muscle metabolism or shivering intensity, but depended on the sum of responses of these two metabolic tissues. Cold-induced increase in non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) appearance rate was strongly associated with the volume of metabolically active BAT (r = 0.80, P = 0.005), total BAT oxidative metabolism (r = 0.70, P = 0.004) and BAT glucose uptake (r = 0.80, P = 0.005), but not muscle glucose metabolism. The total glucose uptake was more than one order of magnitude greater in skeletal muscles compared to BAT during cold exposure (674 +/- 124 vs. 12 +/- 8 mumol min(-1), respectively, P < 0.001). Glucose uptake demonstrated that deeper, centrally located muscles of the neck, back and inner thigh were the greatest contributors of muscle glucose uptake during cold exposure due to their more important shivering response. In summary, these results demonstrate for the first time that the increase in plasma NEFA appearance from WAT lipolysis is closely associated with BAT metabolic activation upon acute cold exposure in healthy men. In humans, muscle glucose utilization during shivering contributes to a much greater extent than BAT to systemic glucose utilization during acute cold exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25384777,N,no brain data,,,

In addition, we collected fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) data from which we quantified white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes. We conducted voxelwise analysis of the dynamic changes in R2* during the VM to determine the distribution of oxygenation changes due to the autonomic stressor. In white matter, we observed significant decreases in oxygenation levels. These effects were predominantly located in posterior white matter and to a lesser degree in the right anterior brain, both concentrated around the border zones (watersheds) between cerebral perfusion territories. These areas are known to be particularly vulnerable to hypoxia and are prone to formation of white matter hyperintensities. Although we observed overlap between localisation of WMH and triggered deoxygenation on the group level, we did not find significant association between these independent variables using subjectwise statistics.

Using group independent component analysis with dual-regression approach of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we examined the functional connectivity changes of large-scale resting state networks during sequential euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp studies in patients with type 1 diabetes and nondiabetic controls and how these changes during hypoglycemia were related to symptoms of hypoglycemia awareness and to concurrent glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. During hypoglycemia, diabetic patients showed increased functional connectivity of the right anterior insula and the prefrontal cortex within the executive control network, which was associated with higher HbA1c. Controls showed decreased functional connectivity of the right anterior insula with the cerebellum/basal ganglia network and of temporal regions within the temporal pole network and increased functional connectivity in the default mode and sensorimotor networks. Functional connectivity reductions in the right basal ganglia were correlated with increases of self-reported hypoglycemic symptoms in controls but not in patients. Resting state networks that showed different group functional connectivity during hypoglycemia may be most sensitive to glycemic environment, and their connectivity patterns may have adapted to repeated glycemic excursions present in type 1 diabetes. Our results suggest that basal ganglia and insula mediation of interoceptive awareness during hypoglycemia is altered in type 1 diabetes. These changes could be neuroplastic adaptations to frequent hypoglycemic experiences. Functional connectivity changes in the insula and prefrontal cognitive networks could also reflect an adaptation to changes in brain metabolic pathways associated with chronic hyperglycemia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The major factor limiting improved glucose control in type 1 diabetes is the significant increase in hypoglycemia associated with insulin treatment. Repeated exposure to hypoglycemia alters patients' ability to recognize the autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms associated with low plasma glucose levels. We examined brain resting state networks during the induction of hypoglycemia in diabetic and control subjects and found differences in networks involved in sensorimotor function, cognition, and interoceptive awareness that were related to chronic levels of glycemic control. These findings identify brain regions that are sensitive to variations in plasma glucose levels and may also provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying the increased incidence of cognitive impairment and affective disorders seen in patients with diabetes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26245963,N,no phys of interest,,,

The aim of this study was to highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to emotional intensity (arousal). We conducted an analysis of the modulation of amygdala activation according to variation in emotional intensity via an fMRI event-related protocol. Monitoring of electrodermal activity, a marker of psychophysiological emotional perception and a reflection of the activation of the autonomic nervous system, was carried out concurrently. Eighteen subjects (10 men; aged from 22 to 29 years) looked at emotionally positive photographs. We demonstrated that the left and right amygdalae were sensitive to changes in emotional intensity, activating more in response to stimuli with higher intensity. Furthermore, electrodermal responses were more frequent for the most intense stimuli, demonstrating the concomitant activation of the autonomic nervous system. These results highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to the intensity of positively valenced visual stimuli, and in conjunction with results in the literature on negative emotions, reinforce the role of the amygdala in the perception of intensity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26217205,N,no corr,,,

What are the organizational principles underlying body part responses in these regions? Here we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) of fMRI data to test multiple possible organizational principles: shape similarity, physical proximity, cortical homunculus proximity, and semantic similarity. Participants viewed pictures of whole persons, chairs, and eight body parts (hands, arms, legs, feet, chests, waists, upper faces, and lower faces). The similarity of multivoxel activity patterns for all body part pairs was established in whole person-selective OTC regions. The resulting neural similarity matrices were then compared with similarity matrices capturing the hypothesized organizational principles. Results showed that the semantic similarity model best captured the neural similarity of body parts in lateral and ventral OTC, which followed an organization in three clusters: (1) body parts used as action effectors (hands, feet, arms, and legs), (2) noneffector body parts (chests and waists), and (3) face parts (upper and lower faces). Whole-brain RSA revealed, in addition to OTC, regions in parietal and frontal cortex in which neural similarity was related to semantic similarity. In contrast, neural similarity in occipital cortex was best predicted by shape similarity models. We suggest that the semantic organization of body parts in high-level visual cortex relates to the different functions associated with the three body part clusters, reflecting the unique processing and connectivity demands associated with the different types of information (e.g., action, social) different body parts (e.g., limbs, faces) convey. Significance statement: While the organization of body part representations in motor and somatosensory cortices has been well characterized, the principles underlying body part representations in visual cortex have not yet been explored. In the present fMRI study we used multivoxel pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis to characterize the organization of body maps in human occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). Results indicate that visual and shape dimensions do not fully account for the organization of body part representations in OTC. Instead, the representational structure of body maps in OTC appears strongly related to functional-semantic properties of body parts. We suggest that this organization reflects the unique processing and connectivity demands associated with the different types of information different body parts convey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26400929,N,no phys of interest,,,
Bi-Directional Tuning of Amygdala Sensitivity in Combat Veterans Investigated with fMRI,PLoS One,"Brashers-Krug, Tom,Jorge, Ricardo,eng,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 29;10(6):e0130246. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0130246. eCollection 2015.","OBJECTIVES: Combat stress can be followed by persistent emotional consequences. It is thought that these emotional consequences are caused in part by increased amygdala reactivity. It is also thought that amygdala hyper-reactivity results from decreased inhibition from portions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in which activity is negatively correlated with activity in the amygdala. However, experimental support for these proposals has been inconsistent. METHODS: We showed movies of combat and civilian scenes during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session to 50 veterans of recent combat. We collected skin conductance responses (SCRs) as measures of emotional arousal. We examined the relation of blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the amygdala and ACC to symptom measures and to SCRs. RESULTS: Emotional arousal, as measured with SCR, was greater during the combat movie than during the civilian movie and did not depend on symptom severity. As expected, amygdala signal during the less-arousing movie increased with increasing symptom severity. Surprisingly, during the more-arousing movie amygdala signal decreased with increasing symptom severity. These differences led to the unexpected result that amygdala signal in highly symptomatic subjects was lower during the more-arousing movie than during the less-arousing movie. Also unexpectedly, we found no significant inverse correlation between any portions of the amygdala and ACC. Rather, signal throughout more than 80% of the ACC showed a strong positive correlation with signal throughout more than 90% of the amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Amygdala reactivity can be tuned bi-directionally, either up or down, in the same person depending on the stimulus and the degree of post-traumatic symptoms. The exclusively positive correlations in BOLD activity between the amygdala and ACC contrast with findings that have been cited as evidence for inhibitory control of the amygdala by the ACC. The conceptualization of post-traumatic changes in neural function should be reconsidered.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26120848,N,no corr,,,

Frequent symptoms among OCD patients include fear of contamination and washing compulsions. Several studies have shown a link between contamination fears, disgust over-reactivity, and insula activation in OCD. In concordance with the role of insula in disgust processing, new neural models based on neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormally high activations of insula could be implicated in OCD psychopathology, at least in the subgroup of patients with contamination fears and washing compulsions. METHODS: In the current study, we used a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) to aid OCD patients to achieve down-regulation of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in anterior insula. Our first aim was to investigate whether patients with contamination obsessions and washing compulsions can learn to volitionally decrease (down-regulate) activity in the insula in the presence of disgust/anxiety provoking stimuli. Our second aim was to evaluate the effect of down-regulation on clinical, behavioural and physiological changes pertaining to OCD symptoms. Hence, several pre- and post-training measures were performed, i.e., confronting the patient with a disgust/anxiety inducing real-world object (Ecological Disgust Test), and subjective rating and physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance level) of disgust towards provoking pictures. RESULTS: Results of this pilot study, performed in 3 patients (2 females), show that OCD patients can gain self-control of the BOLD activity of insula, albeit to different degrees. In two patients positive changes in behaviour in the EDT were observed following the rtfMRI trainings. Behavioural changes were also confirmed by reductions in the negative valence and in the subjective perception of disgust towards symptom provoking images. CONCLUSION: Although preliminary, results of this study confirmed that insula down-regulation is possible in patients suffering from OCD, and that volitional decreases of insula activation could be used for symptom alleviation in this disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26301829,N,clinical,,,

Among such factors, psychosocial stress has been proposed to play a major role in the expression of symptoms. However, it is unsettled how stress interacts with pathophysiological pathways to produce the disease. We studied 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls aged 18 to 50years with 3T-fMRI, in which a period of 6min of resting state acquisition was followed by a block design, with three blocks of 1-min control-task, 1-min stress-task and 1-min rest after-task. Self-report of stress and PANSS were measured. Limbic structures were activated in schizophrenia patients by simple tasks and remained active during, and shortly after stress. In controls, stress-related brain activation was more time-focused, and restricted to the stressful task itself. Negative symptom severity was inversely related to activation of anterior cingulum and orbitofrontal cortex. Results might represent the neurobiological aspect of hyper-reactivity to normal stressful situations previously described in schizophrenia, thus providing evidence on the involvement of limbic areas in the response to stress in schizophrenia. Patients present a pattern of persistent limbic activation probably contributing to hypervigilance and subsequent psychotic thought distortions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190301,N,no phys of interest,,,

Of the 15,975 examined patients, 12,780 and 3195 were categorized into the non-GP and GP cohorts, respectively. The relative risks of stroke were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The overall incidence of stroke was higher in the GP cohort than in the non-GP cohort (6.66 vs 5.20/1000 person-yr), with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.42).

We tested the neural substrates of cardiorespiratory control in humans during volitional controlled breathing and hypoxic challenge using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned during paced (slow and normal rate) breathing and during spontaneous breathing of normoxic and hypoxic (13% inspired O2) air. Cardiovascular and respiratory measures were acquired concurrently, including beat-to-beat blood pressure from a subset of participants (N = 7). Slow breathing was associated with increased tidal ventilatory volume. Induced hypoxia raised heart rate and suppressed heart rate variability. Within the brain, slow breathing activated dorsal pons, periaqueductal grey matter, cerebellum, hypothalamus, thalamus and lateral and anterior insular cortices. Blocks of hypoxia activated mid pons, bilateral amygdalae, anterior insular and occipitotemporal cortices. Interaction between slow breathing and hypoxia was expressed in ventral striatal and frontal polar activity. Across conditions, within brainstem, dorsal medullary and pontine activity correlated with tidal volume and inversely with heart rate. Activity in rostroventral medulla correlated with beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate variability. Widespread insula and striatal activity tracked decreases in heart rate, while subregions of insular cortex correlated with momentary increases in tidal volume. Our findings define slow breathing effects on central and cardiovascular responses to hypoxic challenge. They highlight the recruitment of discrete brainstem nuclei to cardiorespiratory control, and the engagement of corticostriatal circuitry in support of physiological responses that accompany breathing regulation during hypoxic challenge.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25973923,Y,corr,uns,,

Epub 2014 Oct 30.","BACKGROUND: Current neurocircuitry models of anxiety disorders posit a lack of inhibitory tone in the amygdala during acquisition of Pavlovian fear responses and deficient encoding of extinction responses in amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuits. Competition between these two responses often results in a return of fear, limiting control over anxiety. However, one hypothesis holds that a pharmacologic strategy aimed at reducing amygdala activity while simultaneously augmenting medial prefrontal cortex function could facilitate the extinction of conditioned fear. METHODS: Key among the endogenous inhibitors of amygdala activity in response to social fear signals is the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin. To address the question whether oxytocin can strengthen Pavlovian extinction beyond its role in controlling social fear, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with 62 healthy male participants in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design. Specifically, subjects were exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm before receiving an intranasal dose (24 IU) of synthetic oxytocin or placebo. RESULTS: Oxytocin, when administered intranasally after Pavlovian fear conditioning, was found to increase electrodermal responses and prefrontal cortex signals to conditioned fear in the early phase of extinction and to enhance the decline of skin conductance responses in the late phase of extinction. Oxytocin also evoked an unspecific inhibition of amygdalar responses in both phases. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings identify oxytocin as a differentially acting modulator of neural hubs involved in Pavlovian extinction. This specific profile of oxytocin action may open up new avenues for enhancing extinction-based therapies for anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542304,N,pharma study,,,

We sought to characterize the impact of childhood abuse and neglect on the neural correlates of stress- and drug cue-induced drug craving associated with cocaine addiction. Cocaine-dependent men with (n = 20) and without (n = 18) moderate to severe childhood maltreatment histories underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during script-guided mental imagery of personalized stress, drug use and neutral experiences. Compared to the neutral script, the stress and drug use scripts activated striatal, prefrontal, posterior cingulate, temporal and cerebellar regions consistent with prior studies of induced states of stress and drug craving. For the stress script, maltreated men exhibited reduced activation of the anterior precuneus and supplementary motor area (SMA); the interaction of maltreatment severity and stress-induced craving responses predicted lesser rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation. For the drug use script, maltreated men exhibited greater left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation. The interaction of maltreatment severity and craving responses was associated with greater activation of the visual cortex and SMA, whereas a maltreatment-by-anxiety interaction effect included lesser ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation. The outcomes indicate an association of childhood maltreatment with a heightened appetitive anticipatory response to drug cues and a diminished engagement of regulatory and controlled action selection processes in response to stress- or drug cue-induced drug craving and anxiety responses for cocaine-dependent men.

We asked participants to listen to spoken syllables that differed considerably in their surface acoustic form by changing speaker and degrading surface acoustics using noise-vocoding and sine wave synthesis while we recorded neural responses with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found evidence for a graded hierarchy of abstraction across the brain. At the peak of the hierarchy, neural representations in somatomotor cortex encoded syllable identity but not surface acoustic form, at the base of the hierarchy, primary auditory cortex showed the reverse. In contrast, bilateral temporal cortex exhibited an intermediate response, encoding both syllable identity and the surface acoustic form of speech. Regions of somatomotor cortex associated with encoding syllable identity in perception were also engaged when producing the same syllables in a separate session.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective and widely used treatment for preventing collapse of the upper airway in OSA. In addition to improving sleep, CPAP decreases daytime MSNA towards control levels. It remains unknown how this restoration of MSNA occurs, in particular whether CPAP treatment results in a simple readjustment in activity of those brain regions responsible for the initial increase in MSNA or whether other brain regions are recruited to over-ride aberrant brain activity. By recording MSNA concurrently with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we aimed to assess brain activity associated with each individual subject's patterns of MSNA prior to and following 6 months of CPAP treatment. Spontaneous fluctuations in MSNA were recorded via tungsten microelectrodes inserted into the common peroneal nerve in 13 newly diagnosed patients with OSA before and after 6 months of treatment with CPAP and in 15 healthy control subjects while lying in a 3 T MRI scanner. Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast gradient echo, echo-planar images were continuously collected in a 4 s ON, 4 s OFF (200 volumes) sampling protocol. MSNA was significantly elevated in newly diagnosed OSA patients compared to control subjects (55 +/- 4 vs 26 +/- 2 bursts/min). Fluctuations in BOLD signal intensity in multiple regions covaried with the intensity of the concurrently recorded bursts of MSNA. There was a significant fall in MSNA after 6 months of CPAP (39 +/- 2 bursts/min).

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether non-invasive electrical stimulation of the cymba conchae, a region of the external ear exclusively innervated by the ABVN, activates the NTS and the ""classical"" central vagal projections in humans. METHODS: Twelve healthy adults underwent two fMRI scans in the same session.

Secondly, angry compared with neutral expressions elicited activity in the inferior frontal cortex IFC and the dorsal basal ganglia (BG), specifically during evoked expressions. Angry expressions also activated the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the latter correlated with pupil size as an indicator of bodily arousal during emotional output behavior.

Ventro-medial prefrontal-cortex (vmPFC) activity has been shown to relate to idiosyncratic tendencies in accepting unfair offers possibly through its role in emotion regulation. Nevertheless, standard UG paradigms lack fundamental aspects of real-life social interactions in which one reacts to other people in a response contingent fashion. To uncover the neural substrates underlying the tendency to accept anger-infused ultimatum offers during dynamic social interactions, we incorporated on-line verbal negotiations with an obnoxious partner in a repeated-UG during fMRI scanning. We hypothesized that vmPFC activity will differentiate between individuals with high or low monetary gains accumulated throughout the game and reflect a divergence in the associated emotional experience. We found that as individuals gained more money, they reported less anger but also more positive feelings and had slower sympathetic response. In addition, high-gain individuals had increased vmPFC activity, but also decreased brainstem activity, which possibly reflected the locus coeruleus. During the more angering unfair offers, these individuals had increased dorsal-posterior Insula (dpI) activity which functionally coupled to the medial-thalamus (mT). Finally, both vmPFC activity and dpI-mT connectivity contributed to increased gain, possibly by modulating the ongoing subjective emotional experience. These ecologically valid findings point towards a neural mechanism that might nurture pro-social interactions by modulating an individual's dynamic emotional experience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26166623,M,scr-latency?,uns,,

Epub 2014 Apr 19.","BACKGROUND: Anxiety produced by environmental threats can impair goal-directed processing and is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders, particularly when aversive events occur unpredictably. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat detection, such as the amygdala. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) have been linked to the regulation of anxiety during threat exposure. We developed a paradigm to determine if threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala and IFG, OFC, and vmPFC. METHODS: Healthy adults performed a computer-gaming style task involving capturing prey and evading predators to optimize monetary rewards while exposed to the threat of unpredictable shock. Psychophysiological recording (n = 26) and functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning (n = 17) were collected during the task in separate cohorts. Task-specific changes in functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological interaction analysis. RESULTS: Threat exposure resulted in greater arousal measured by increased skin conductance but did not influence performance (i.e., monetary losses or rewards). Greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and bilateral IFG, OFC, vmPFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat. Our paradigm is well-suited to explore the neural underpinnings of the anxiety response to unpredictable threat in patients with various anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882566,N,no corr,,,

They communicate the affective state and intent of an individual and, if interpreted correctly, adaptively influence the behavior of others in return. Processing of such affective stimuli is known to require reciprocal signaling between central viscerosensory brain regions and peripheral-autonomic body systems, culminating in accurate emotion discrimination. Despite emerging links between sleep and affective regulation, the impact of sleep loss on the discrimination of complex social emotions within and between the CNS and PNS remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate in humans that sleep deprivation impairs both viscerosensory brain (anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala) and autonomic-cardiac discrimination of threatening from affiliative facial cues. Moreover, sleep deprivation significantly degrades the normally reciprocal associations between these central and peripheral emotion-signaling systems, most prominent at the level of cardiac-amygdala coupling. In addition, REM sleep physiology across the sleep-rested night significantly predicts the next-day success of emotional discrimination within this viscerosensory network across individuals, suggesting a role for REM sleep in affective brain recalibration. Together, these findings establish that sleep deprivation compromises the faithful signaling of, and the ""embodied"" reciprocity between, viscerosensory brain and peripheral autonomic body processing of complex social signals. Such impairments hold ecological relevance in professional contexts in which the need for accurate interpretation of social cues is paramount yet insufficient sleep is pervasive.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26180190,N,cardiac discrimination index?,uns,,

Specifically, fluctuations in end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), in addition to cardiac rate variation (CRV), and respiratory volume per time (RVT) variations, have been known to confound the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signal. Previous studies addressed the resting-state fMRI response function to CRV and RVT, but no attempt has been made to directly estimate the voxel-wise response function to PETCO2. Moreover, the potential interactions among PETCO2, CRV, and RVT necessitate their simultaneous inclusion in a multi-regression model to estimate the PETCO2 response. In this study, we use such a model to estimate the voxel-wise PETCO2 response functions directly from rs-fMRI data of nine healthy subjects. We also characterized the effect of sampling rate (TR=2seconds vs. 323ms) on the temporal and spatial variability of the PETCO2 response function in addition to that of CRV and RVT. In addition, we assess the test-retest reproducibility of the response functions to PETCO2, CRV and RVT. We found that despite overlaps across their spatial patterns, PETCO2 explains a unique portion of the rs-fMRI signal variance compared to RVT and CRV.

Yet to date, no work has addressed the functional relevance of the cholinergic basal forebrain in facilitating signaling from the amygdala in humans. We set out to determine how blood oxygen level-dependent signal within the amygdala and cholinergic basal forebrain interact to predict neural responses within downstream targets.

In this study, we examined autonomic arousal indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR), concurrent cortical responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and effective brain connectivity estimated by dynamic causal modeling in seventeen unmedicated high-functioning adults with ASD and seventeen matched controls while they performed an empathy-for-pain task. Compared to controls, adults with ASD showed enhanced SCR related to empathetic pain, along with increased neural activity in the anterior insular cortex, although their behavioral empathetic pain discriminability was reduced and overall SCR was decreased. ASD individuals also showed enhanced correlation between SCR and neural activities in the anterior insular cortex. Importantly, significant group differences in effective brain connectivity were limited to greater reduction in the negative intrinsic connectivity of the anterior insular cortex in the ASD group, indicating a failure in attenuating anterior insular responses to empathetic pain.

Here, a functional polymorphism in the NPSR1 gene has been linked to deviant cortico-limbic interactions in response to negative stimuli. While healthy T allele carriers exhibited increased amygdala and prefrontal cortex activity, panic disorder patients carrying the T risk allele displayed hypofrontality possibly reflecting insufficient prefrontal inhibition of limbic reactivity. In order to study multi-level effects of genotype and anxiety, prefrontal cortex activity during an emotional n-back task was measured in 66 volunteers genotyped for the NPSR1 rs324981 A/T variant (AA homozygotes vs. T allele carriers) by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. For a high working memory load (3-back), T allele carriers showed a signal increase to negative pictures in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex while AA homozygotes displayed a signal decrease. Since groups did not differ on skin conductance level and behavioral parameters, this effect in the risk group in line with results from fMRI studies is speculated to represent an adaptive mechanism to compensate for presumably increased subcortical activity driven by an overactive NPS system.

Epub 2015 Jul 21.","Relapse is a pertinent problem in the treatment of anxiety disorders. In the laboratory, relapse is modeled as return of conditioned fear responses after successful fear extinction and is explained by insufficient retrieval and/or expression of the fear-inhibitory extinction memory that is generated during extinction learning. We have shown in mice and humans that return of fear can be prevented by administration of a single dose of the dopamine precursor l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) immediately after extinction. In mice, this effect could be attributed to an enhancement of extinction memory consolidation. In our human study, we could not exclude that l-DOPA might have acted by interfering with the consolidation of the original fear memory. In the present study, we therefore used a combined differential cue and context conditioning paradigm where initial fear conditioning and extinction were conducted one day apart, in analogy to previous mouse studies. l-DOPA (N=21) or placebo (N=19) were administered after extinction, precluding any action on fear memory consolidation. In the return-of-fear test conducted one week later, drug effects on conditioned skin conductance responses were absent. However, we found evidence indicative of reduced neural activity, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the l-DOPA group in areas related to conditioned fear and return of fear (amygdala, posterior hippocampus) and enhanced activity in a key area of extinction retrieval/expression (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), relative to placebo controls.

Whereas goal intention ER strategies were associated with activation of brain areas previously reported to be involved in effortful ER (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), ER strategies based on an implementation intention strategy were associated with activation of right inferior frontal gyrus and ventro-parietal cortex, which may reflect the attentional control processes automatically captured by the cue for action contained within the implementation intention. Goal intentions were also associated with less effective modulation of left amygdala, supporting the increased efficacy of ER under implementation intention instructions, which showed coupling of orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala.

This variability may be partially explained by differences in emotional processes, such as locus of control and affective state, which vary across individuals. Although the basic neural circuitry that mediates the response to threat has been described, the impact individual differences in affective state and locus of control have on that response is not well characterized. Understanding how these factors influence the neural response to threat would provide new insight into processes that mediate emotional function. Therefore, the present study used a Pavlovian conditioning procedure to investigate the influence individual differences in locus of control, positive affect, and negative affect have on the brain and behavioral responses to predictable and unpredictable threats. Thirty-two healthy volunteers participated in a fear conditioning study in which predictable and unpredictable threats (i.e., unconditioned stimulus) were presented during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Locus of control showed a linear relationship with learning-related ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity such that the more external an individual's locus of control, the greater their differential response to predictable versus unpredictable threat. In addition, positive and negative affectivity showed a curvilinear relationship with dorsolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and insula activity, such that those with high or low affectivity showed reduced regional activity compared to those with an intermediate level of affectivity. Further, activity within the PFC, as well as other regions including the amygdala, were linked with the peripheral emotional response as indexed by skin conductance and electromyography. The current findings demonstrate that the neural response to threat within brain regions that mediate the peripheral emotional response is modulated by an individual's affective state as well as their perceptions of an event's causality.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26196669,N,curvlinear,rand,,

Using a voxel-wise mediation analysis framework, we formally tested for 'neural mediators' of the predicted association between trait AS score and in-scanner anxiety sensations during fear conditioning. Contrary to the anterior insular hypothesis, no evidence of significant mediation was observed for this brain region, which was instead linked to perceived anxiety sensations independently from AS. Evidence for significant mediation was obtained for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex-a finding that we argue is more consistent with the hypothesized role of human cingulofrontal cortex in conscious threat appraisal processes, including threat-overestimation.

Uptake of (11)C-MRB, was quantified as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) using the occipital cortex as a low NET density reference region. Total body fat and lean body mass were assessed via bioelectrical impedance analysis. RESULTS: As expected, (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT was difficult to identify at RT but easily detected with cold stimulation (p=0.01). In contrast, BAT (11)C-MRB uptake (also normalized for muscle) was equally evident under both RT and cold conditions (BAT DVR: RT 1.0+/-0.3 vs. cold 1.1+/-0.3, p=0.31; BAT/muscle DVR: RT 2.3+/-0.7 vs. cold 2.5+/-0.5, p=0.61). Importantly, BAT DVR and BAT/muscle DVR of (11)C-MRB at RT correlated positively with core body temperature (r=0.76, p=0.05 and r=0.92, p=0.004, respectively), a relationship not observed with (18)F-FDG (p=0.63). Furthermore, there were gender differences in (11)C-MRB uptake in response to cold (p=0.03), which reflected significant differences in the change in (11)C-MRB as a function of both body composition and body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike (18)F-FDG, the uptake of (11)C-MRB in BAT offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of BAT in humans under basal, room temperature conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25798999,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2014 Oct 12.","One of the major artifact corrupting electroencephalogram (EEG) acquired during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the pulse artifact (PA). It is mainly due to the motion of the head and attached electrodes and wires in the magnetic field occurring after each heartbeat. In this study we propose a novel method to improve PA detection by considering the strong gradient and inversed polarity between left and right EEG electrodes. We acquired high-density EEG-fMRI (256 electrodes) with simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) at 3 T. PA was estimated as the voltage difference between right and left signals from the electrodes showing the strongest artifact (facial and temporal). Peaks were detected on this estimated signal and compared to the peaks in the ECG recording. We analyzed data from eleven healthy subjects, two epileptic patients and four healthy subjects with an insulating layer between electrodes and scalp. The accuracy of the two methods was assessed with three criteria: (i) standard deviation, (ii) kurtosis and (iii) confinement into the physiological range of the inter-peak intervals. We also checked whether the new method has an influence on the identification of epileptic spikes. Results show that estimated PA improved artifact detection in 15/17 cases, when compared to the ECG method. Moreover, epileptic spike identification was not altered by the correction. The proposed method improves the detection of pulse-related artifacts, particularly crucial when the ECG is of poor quality or cannot be recorded. It will contribute to enhance the quality of the EEG increasing the reliability of EEG-informed fMRI analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25307731,N,methods paper,,,

We analyzed the neural mechanisms underlying context-dependent extinction and renewal in a clinically relevant model of conditioned abdominal pain-related fear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, two groups of healthy volunteers underwent differential fear conditioning with painful rectal distensions as unconditioned stimuli (US) and visual conditioned stimuli (CS(+) ; CS(-) ). The extinction context was changed in an experimental group (context group), which was subsequently returned into the original learning context to test for renewal. No context changes occurred in the control group. Group differences in CS-induced differential neural activation were analyzed along with skin conductance responses (SCR), CS valence and CS-US contingency ratings. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: During extinction, group differences in differential neural activation were observed in dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventromedial (vmPFC) prefrontal cortex and amygdala, mainly driven by enhanced activation in response to the CS(-) in the control group. During renewal, observed group differences in activation of dlPFC and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) resulted primarily from differential modulation of the CS(-) in the absence of group differences in response to CS(+) or SCR. CONCLUSION: The extinction context affects the neural processing of nonpain predictive safety cues, supporting a role of safety learning in pain-related memory processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26058893,N,no corr,,,

A subset cortical and subcortical brain regions are implicated in autonomic control of bodily arousal during emotional behaviors. Here, we combined human functional neuroimaging with autonomic monitoring to identify neural mechanisms that support the volitional regulation of heart rate, a process that may be assisted by visual feedback. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 15 healthy adults performed an experimental task in which they were prompted voluntarily to increase or decrease cardiovascular arousal (heart rate) during true, false, or absent visual feedback. Participants achieved appropriate changes in heart rate, without significant modulation of respiratory rate, and were overall not influenced by the presence of visual feedback. Increased activity in right amygdala, striatum and brainstem occurred when participants attempted to increase heart rate. In contrast, activation of ventrolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices occurred when attempting to decrease heart rate. Biofeedback enhanced activity within occipito-temporal cortices, but there was no significant interaction with task conditions. Activity in regions including pregenual anterior cingulate and ventral striatum reflected the magnitude of successful task performance, which was negatively related to subclinical anxiety symptoms. Measured changes in respiration correlated with posterior insula activation and heart rate, at a more lenient threshold, change correlated with insula, caudate, and midbrain activity. Our findings highlight a set of brain regions, notably ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, supporting volitional control of cardiovascular arousal. These data are relevant to understanding neural substrates supporting interaction between intentional and interoceptive states related to anxiety, with implications for biofeedback interventions, e.g., real-time fMRI, that target emotional regulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25992711,N,no coords,rand,,

Epub 2015 Apr 9.","The role of contextual expectation in processing familiar and novel stimuli was investigated in a series of experiments combining eye tracking, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and behavioral methods. An experimental paradigm emphasizing either familiarity or novelty detection at retrieval was used. The detection of unexpected familiar and novel stimuli, which were characterized by lower probability, engaged activity in midbrain and striatal structures. Specifically, detecting unexpected novel stimuli, relative to expected novel stimuli, produced greater activity in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), whereas the detection of unexpected familiar, relative to expected, familiar stimuli, elicited activity in the striatum/globus pallidus (GP). An effective connectivity analysis showed greater functional coupling between these two seed areas (GP and SN/VTA) and the hippocampus, for unexpected than for expected stimuli. Within this network of midbrain/striatal-hippocampal interactions two pathways are apparent; the direct SN-hippocampal pathway sensitive to unexpected novelty and the perirhinal-GP-hippocampal pathway sensitive to unexpected familiarity. In addition, increased eye fixations and pupil dilations also accompanied the detection of unexpected relative to expected familiar and novel stimuli, reflecting autonomic activity triggered by the functioning of these two pathways. Finally, subsequent memory for unexpected, relative to expected, familiar, and novel stimuli was characterized by enhanced recollection, but not familiarity, accuracy. Taken together, these findings suggest that a hippocampal-midbrain network, characterized by two distinct pathways, mediates encoding facilitation and most critically, that this facilitation is driven by contextual novelty, rather than by the absolute novelty of a stimulus. This contextually sensitive neural mechanism appears to elicit increased exploratory behavior, leading subsequently to greater recollection of the unexpected stimulus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25708843,N,no phys of interest,,,
Lesser Neural Pattern Similarity across Repeated Tests Is Associated with Better Long-Term Memory Retention,J Neurosci,"Karlsson Wirebring, Linnea,Wiklund-Hornqvist, Carola,Eriksson, Johan,Andersson, Micael,Jonsson, Bert,Nyberg, Lars,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,J Neurosci. 2015 Jul 1;35(26):9595-602. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3550-14.2015.","UNLABELLED: Encoding and retrieval processes enhance long-term memory performance. The efficiency of encoding processes has recently been linked to representational consistency: the reactivation of a representation that gets more specific each time an item is further studied. Here we examined the complementary hypothesis of whether the efficiency of retrieval processes also is linked to representational consistency. Alternatively, recurrent retrieval might foster representational variability--the altering or adding of underlying memory representations. Human participants studied 60 Swahili-Swedish word pairs before being scanned with fMRI the same day and 1 week later. On Day 1, participants were tested three times on each word pair, and on Day 7 each pair was tested once. A BOLD signal change in right superior parietal cortex was associated with subsequent memory on Day 1 and with successful long-term retention on Day 7. A representational similarity analysis in this parietal region revealed that beneficial recurrent retrieval was associated with representational variability, such that the pattern similarity on Day 1 was lower for retrieved words subsequently remembered compared with those subsequently forgotten. This was mirrored by a monotonically decreased BOLD signal change in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on Day 1 as a function of repeated successful retrieval for words subsequently remembered, but not for words subsequently forgotten. This reduction in prefrontal response could reflect reduced demands on cognitive control. Collectively, the results offer novel insights into why memory retention benefits from repeated retrieval, and they suggest fundamental differences between repeated study and repeated testing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Repeated testing is known to produce superior long-term retention of the to-be-learned material compared with repeated encoding and other learning techniques, much because it fosters repeated memory retrieval. This study demonstrates that repeated memory retrieval might strengthen memory by inducing more differentiated or elaborated memory representations in the parietal cortex, and at the same time reducing demands on prefrontal-cortex-mediated cognitive control processes during retrieval. The findings contrast with recent demonstrations that repeated encoding induces less differentiated or elaborated memory representations. Together, this study suggests a potential neurocognitive explanation of why repeated retrieval is more beneficial for long-term retention than repeated encoding, a phenomenon known as the testing effect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26134642,N,no phys of interest,,,

Tasting and digesting spicy foods containing capsaicin induce various physiological responses such as perspiration from face, salivation, and facilitation of cardiovascular activity, which are thought to be caused through viscero-visceral autonomic reflexes. However, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the involvement of higher-order sensory-motor integration between the M/PSG and anterior short gyrus (ASG) known as the autonomic region of the insula. To reveal a possible functional coordination between the M/PSG and ASG, we here addressed whether capsaicin increases neural activity in the ASG as well as the M/PSG using fMRI and a custom-made taste delivery system. Twenty subjects participated in this study, and three tastant solutions: capsaicin, NaCl, and artificial saliva (AS) were used. Group analyses with the regions activated by capsaicin revealed significant activations in the bilateral ASG and M/PSG. The fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals in response to capsaicin stimulation were significantly higher in ASG than in M/PSG regardless of the side. Concomitantly, capsaicin increased the fingertip temperature significantly. Although there was no significant correlation between the fingertip temperatures and BOLD signals in the ASG or M/PSG when the contrast [Capsaicin-AS] or [Capsaicin-NaCl] was computed, a significant correlation was found in the bilateral ASG when the contrast [2 x Capsaicin-NaCl-AS] was computed. In contrast, there was a significant correlation in the hypothalamus regardless of the contrasts. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between M/PSG and ASG. These results indicate that capsaicin increases neural activity in the ASG as well as the M/PSG, suggesting that the neural coordination between the two cortical areas may be involved in autonomic responses to tasting spicy foods as reflected in fingertip temperature increases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26834613,N,finger tip temp?,,,

While several studies have demonstrated altered resting brain connectivity in FM, studies have not specifically probed the somatosensory system and its role in both somatic and nonsomatic FM symptoms. Our objective was to evaluate resting primary somatosensory cortex (S1) connectivity and to explore how sustained, evoked deep tissue pain modulates this connectivity. METHODS: We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrocardiography data on FM patients and healthy controls during rest (the rest phase) and during sustained mechanical pressure-induced pain over the lower leg (the pain phase). Functional connectivity associated with different S1 subregions was calculated, while S1(leg) connectivity (representation of the leg in the primary somatosensory cortex) was contrasted between the rest phase and the pain phase and was correlated with clinically relevant measures in FM. RESULTS: During the rest phase, FM patients showed decreased connectivity between multiple ipsilateral and cross-hemispheric S1 subregions, which was correlated with clinical pain severity. Compared to the rest phase, the pain phase produced increased S1(leg) connectivity to the bilateral anterior insula in FM patients, but not in healthy controls. Moreover, in FM patients, sustained pain-altered S1(leg) connectivity to the anterior insula was correlated with clinical/behavioral pain measures and autonomic responses. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that both somatic and nonsomatic dysfunction in FM, including clinical pain, pain catastrophizing, autonomic dysfunction, and amplified temporal summation, are closely linked with the degree to which evoked deep tissue pain alters S1 connectivity to salience/affective pain-processing regions. Additionally, diminished connectivity between S1 subregions during the rest phase in FM may result from ongoing widespread clinical pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25622796,N,no phys of interest,,,

It has been assumed that an avoidant (repressive) coping style is characterized by increased emotion regulation efforts in context of fear stimuli as compared to a more vigilant coping style. However, no study so far has investigated the neural correlates of fear conditioning of repressors and sensitizers. In the present fMRI study, 76 participants were classified as repressors or as sensitizers and were exposed to a fear conditioning paradigm, in which the CS+ predicted electrical stimulation, while another neutral stimulus (CS-) did not.

Therefore, it is important to identify genetic variations, which impact appetitive conditioning. It has been suggested that the Val(158) Met-polymorphism in the Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) is associated with the alteration of neural processes of appetitive conditioning due to the central role of the dopaminergic system in reward processing. However, no study has so far investigated the relationship between variations in the COMT Val(158) Met-polymorphism and appetitive conditioning. In this fMRI study, an appetitive conditioning paradigm was applied, in which one neutral stimulus (CS+) predicted appetitive stimuli (UCS) while a second neutral stimulus (CS-) was never paired with the UCS. As a main result, we observed a significant association between the COMT Val(158) Met-genotype and appetitive conditioning: skin conductance responses (SCRs) revealed a significant difference between CS+ and CS- in Val/Val-allele carriers but not in the other genotype groups. Val/Val-allele carriers showed increased hemodynamic responses in the amygdala compared with the Met/Met-allele group in the contrast CS+ > CS-. In addition, psychophysiological-interaction analysis revealed increased effective amygdala/ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity in Met/Met-allele carriers. The increased amygdala activity points to facilitated appetitive conditioning in Val/Val-allele carriers while the amygdala/prefrontal connectivity results could be regarded as a marker for altered emotion regulation during conditioning, which potentially impacts appetitive learning sensitivity. The SCRs finding indicates a stronger conditioned response in the Val/Val-allele group and dovetails with the neural differences between the groups.

We aimed to discover and validate a gene-brain-behavior pathway by linking presumed genetic risk for anxiety-related psychopathology, key neural activity involved in anxious anticipation, and resulting aversive emotional states. METHODS: The functional neuroanatomy of aversive anticipation was probed through functional magnetic resonance imaging in two independent samples of healthy subjects (n = 99 and n = 69), and we studied the influence of genetic variance in the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Skin conductance and startle data served as objective psychophysiological indices of the intensity of individuals' anticipatory responses to potential threat. RESULTS: Threat cues signaling risk of future electrical shock activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), anterior insula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, and midbrain consistently across both samples. Threat-related dmPFC activation was enhanced in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers in sample 1 and this effect was validated in sample 2. Critically, we show that this region mediates the increase in anticipatory psychophysiological reactions in short allele carriers indexed by skin conductance (experiment 1) and startle reactions (experiment 2). CONCLUSIONS: The converging results from these experiments demonstrate that innate 5-HTTLPR linked variation in dmPFC activity predicts psychophysiological responsivity to pending threats. Our results reveal a neurogenetic pathway mediating interindividual variability in anticipatory responses to threat and yield a novel mechanistic account for previously reported associations between genetic variability in serotonin transporter function and stress-related psychopathology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25444169,M,mediation?,,,

This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 23 females and 20 males to investigate cognitive downregulation of negative, stressful sensations during a frequently used psychosocial stress task. Additionally, subjective responses, cognitive regulation strategies, salivary cortisol, and skin conductance response were assessed. Subjective response supported the experimental manipulation by showing higher anger and negative affect ratings after stress regulation than after the mere exposure to stress. On a neural level, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) were more strongly activated during regulation than nonregulation, whereas the hippocampus was less activated during regulation. Sex differences were evident: after regulation females expressed higher subjective stress ratings than males, and these ratings were associated with right hippocampal activation. In the nonregulation block, females showed greater activation of the left amygdala and the right STG during stress than males while males recruited the putamen more robustly in this condition. Thus, cognitive regulation of stressful achievement situations seems to induce additional stress, to recruit regions implicated in attention integration and working memory and to deactivate memory retrieval. Stress itself is associated with greater activation of limbic as well as attention areas in females than males. Additionally, activation of the memory system during cognitive regulation of stress is associated with greater perceived stress in females.

Because of the near exclusive usage in past research of visual stimuli to elicit emotions, it is unknown whether the same neural substrates underlie the reappraisal of emotions induced through other sensory modalities. Here, participants reappraised their emotions in order to increase or decrease their emotional response to angry prosody, or maintained their attention to it in a control condition. Neural activity was monitored with fMRI, and connectivity was investigated by using psychophysiological interaction analyses. A right-sided network encompassing the superior temporal gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus and the inferior frontal gyrus was found to underlie the processing of angry prosody. During reappraisal to increase emotional response, the left superior frontal gyrus showed increased activity and became functionally coupled to right auditory cortices. During reappraisal to decrease emotional response, a network that included the medial frontal gyrus and posterior parietal areas showed increased activation and greater functional connectivity with bilateral auditory regions. Activations pertaining to this network were more extended on the right side of the brain. Although directionality cannot be inferred from PPI analyses, the findings suggest a similar frontoparietal network for the reappraisal of visually and auditorily induced negative emotions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964502,N,no phys of interest,,,

Few studies have investigated the correlation between CO poisoning and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Therefore, we conducted a population-based, longitudinal cohort study in Taiwan to determine whether patients with CO poisoning are associated with higher risk of developing subsequent CVDs, including arrhythmia, coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). This retrospective study used the National Health Insurance Research Database. The study cohort comprised all patients aged >/=20 years with a diagnosis of CO poisoning and hospitalized during 2000 to 2011 (N = 8381), and the comparison cohort comprised randomly selected non-CO-poisoned patients (N = 33,524) frequency-matched with the study cohort by age, sex, and the year of index date. Each patient was individually tracked to identify those who develop CVD events during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to calculate the hazard ratios of CVDs after adjusting for possible confounders. The overall incidences of arrhythmia, CAD, and CHF were higher in the patients with CO poisoning than in the controls (2.57 vs 1.25/1000 person-years, 3.28 vs 2.25/1000 person-years, and 1.32 vs 1.05/1000 person-years, respectively). After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the patients with CO poisoning were associated with a 1.83-fold higher risk of arrhythmia compared with the comparison cohort, and nonsignificantly associated with risk of CAD and CHF. CO-poisoned patients with coexisting comorbidity or in high severity were associated with significantly and substantially increased risk of all 3 CVDs. CO poisoning is associated with increased risk of subsequent development of arrhythmia. Future studies are required to explore the long-term effects of CO poisoning on the cardiovascular system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761191,N,clinical,,,

Studying the variations in brain activity that occur during microgravity would help astronauts to deal with these changes. In the current study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to observe the variations in brain activity during a 7-day head down tilt (HDT) bed rest, which is a common and reliable model for simulated microgravity. The amplitudes of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of twenty subjects were recorded pre-head down tilt (pre-HDT), during a bed rest period (HDT0), and then each day in the HDT period (HDT1-HDT7). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the ALFF values over these 8 days was used to test the variation across time period (p < 0.05, corrected). Compared to HDT0, subjects presented lower ALFF values in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and higher ALFF values in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during the HDT period, which may partially account for the lack of cognitive flexibility and alterations in autonomic nervous system seen among astronauts in microgravity. Additionally, the observed improvement in function in CPL during the HDT period may play a compensatory role to the functional decline in the paracentral lobule to sustain normal levels of fine motor control for astronauts in a microgravity environment. Above all, those floating brain activities during 7 days of simulated microgravity may indicate that the brain self-adapts to help astronauts adjust to the multiple negative stressors encountered in a microgravity environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26029071,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, most of the studies in humans do not link startle potentiation and neural activity during fear acquisition and extinction. Therefore, we examined startle blink responses measured with electromyography (EMG) and brain activity measured with functional MRI simultaneously during differential conditioning. Furthermore, we combined these behavioral fear indices with brain network activity by analyzing the brain activity evoked by the startle probe stimulus presented during conditioned visual threat and safety cues as well as in the absence of visual stimulation. In line with previous research, we found a fear-induced potentiation of the startle blink responses when elicited during a conditioned threat stimulus and a rapid decline of amygdala activity after an initial differentiation of threat and safety cues in early acquisition trials. Increased activation during processing of threat cues was also found in the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). More importantly, our results depict an increase of brain activity to probes presented during threatening in comparison to safety cues indicating an involvement of the anterior insula, the ACC, the thalamus, and the PAG in fear-potentiated startle processing during early extinction trials. Our study underlines that parallel assessment of fear-potentiated startle in fMRI paradigms can provide a helpful method to investigate common and distinct processing pathways in humans and animals and, thus, contributes to translational research.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25725377,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Fifty-nine healthy participants, genotyped for the functional BDNFval66met polymorphism, underwent a fear conditioning and 24h-delayed extinction protocol while skin conductance and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses (functional magnetic resonance imaging) were acquired. We present the first report of neural activation pattern during fear acquisition 'and' extinction for the BDNFval66met polymorphism using a differential conditioned stimulus (CS)+ > CS- comparison. During conditioning, we observed heightened allele dose-dependent responses in the amygdala and reduced responses in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in BDNFval66met met-carriers. During early extinction, 24h later, we again observed heightened responses in several regions ascribed to the fear network in met-carriers as opposed to val-carriers (insula, amygdala, hippocampus), which likely reflects fear memory recall. No differences were observed during late extinction, which likely reflects learned extinction.

One of the proposed alterations in sensory processing is an altered engagement of endogenous pain modulation mechanisms. The aim was to test the hypothesis that IBS patients with (IBS-S) and without visceral hypersensitivity (IBS-N) differ in their ability to engage endogenous pain modulation mechanism during habituation to repeated visceral stimuli. METHODS: Brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response was measured during repeated rectal distension and its anticipation in 33 IBS patients with and without visceral hypersensitivity and 18 healthy controls (HCs). BOLD response to early and late phase of the distension series was compared within and between groups. KEY RESULTS: While BOLD response was similar during the early phase of the experiment, IBS-S showed greater BOLD response than IBS-N and HCs during the late phase of the distension series. IBS-S showed increasing BOLD response both to the anticipation and delivery of low intensity rectal distensions in brain regions including insula, anterior and mid cingulate cortex. IBS-N showed decreasing BOLD response to repeated rectal distensions in brain regions including insula, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: These findings are consistent with compromised ability of IBS-S to respond to repeated delivery of rectal stimuli, both in terms of sensitization of sensory pathways and habituation of emotional arousal. The fact that both IBS subgroups met Rome criteria, and did not differ in terms of reported symptom severity demonstrates that similar symptom patterns can result from different underlying neurobiological mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777251,N,no phys of interest,,,

Although little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the sympathoexcitation, we have recently shown that the elevated MSNA in OSA is associated with altered neural processing in various brain stem sites, including the dorsolateral pons, rostral ventrolateral medulla, medullary raphe, and midbrain. Given the risk associated with elevated MSNA, we aimed to determine if treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) would reduce the elevated MSNA and reverse the brain stem functional changes associated with the elevated MSNA. We performed concurrent recordings of MSNA and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity of the brain stem, using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging, in 15 controls and 13 subjects with OSA, before and after 6 mo CPAP treatment. As expected, 6 mo of CPAP treatment significantly reduced MSNA in subjects with OSA, from 54 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 3 bursts/min and from 77 +/- 7 to 36 +/- 3 bursts/100 heart beats. Importantly, we found that MSNA-coupled changes in BOLD signal intensity within the dorsolateral pons, medullary raphe, and rostral ventrolateral medulla returned to control levels. That is, CPAP treatment completely reversed brain stem functional changes associated with elevated MSNA in untreated OSA subjects. These data highlight the effectiveness of CPAP treatment in reducing one of the most significant health issues associated with OSA, that is, elevated MSNA and its associated elevated morbidity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25995345,N,clinical,,,

In recent years, neuroimaging work has yielded a detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying fear conditioning common across participants, however only a minority of studies have investigated the brain basis of inter-individual variation in fear learning. Moreover, the majority of these studies have employed small sample sizes (mean n=17; range n=5-27) and all have failed to meet the minimum recommended sample size for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of individual differences. Here, using fMRI, we analyzed blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response recorded simultaneously with skin conductance response (SCR) and ratings of unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy in 49 participants undergoing Pavlovian fear conditioning. On average, participants became conditioned to the conditioned stimulus (CS+; higher US expectancy ratings and SCR for the CS+ compared to the unpaired conditioned stimulus, CS-); the CS+ also robustly increased activation in the bilateral insula. Amygdala activation was revealed from a regression analysis that incorporated individual differences in fear conditionability (i.e., a between-subjects regressor of mean CS+>CS- SCR). By replicating results observed using much smaller sample sizes, the results confirm that variation in amygdala reactivity covaries with individual differences in fear conditionability. The link between behavior (SCR) and brain (amygdala reactivity) may be a putative endophenotype for the acquisition of fear memories.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819422,Y,corr,rand,,

Furthermore, participants showed greater activation after versus before treatment in the right anterior cingulate, during fearful relative to happy face processing.

Mental processes influence bodily physiology, which in turn feeds back to influence thoughts and feelings. Afferent cardiovascular signals from arterial baroreceptors in the carotid sinuses are processed within the brain and contribute to this two-way communication with the body. These carotid baroreceptors can be stimulated non-invasively by externally applying focal negative pressure bilaterally to the neck. In an experiment combining functional neuroimaging (fMRI) with carotid stimulation in healthy participants, we tested the hypothesis that manipulating afferent cardiovascular signals alters the central processing of emotional information (fearful and neutral facial expressions). Carotid stimulation, compared with sham stimulation, broadly attenuated activity across cortical and brainstem regions. Modulation of emotional processing was apparent as a significant expression-by-stimulation interaction within left amygdala, where responses during appraisal of fearful faces were selectively reduced by carotid stimulation. Moreover, activity reductions within insula, amygdala, and hippocampus correlated with the degree of stimulation-evoked change in the explicit emotional ratings of fearful faces. Across participants, individual differences in autonomic state (heart rate variability, a proxy measure of autonomic balance toward parasympathetic activity) predicted the extent to which carotid stimulation influenced neural (amygdala) responses during appraisal and subjective rating of fearful faces. Together our results provide mechanistic insight into the visceral component of emotion by identifying the neural substrates mediating cardiovascular influences on the processing of fear signals, potentially implicating central baroreflex mechanisms for anxiolytic treatment targets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25578794,Y,corr,uns,,

However, there is a lack of concomitantly longitudinal recordings at personal level of environmental temperature (PET) and cardiophysiological variables together with skin temperatures (STs, the ""interface-variable"" between the body core and ambient temperature). To investigate the intra-individual temporal relationships between PET, STs and BP 60 healthy young women (52 completed the entire study) were prospectively studied in a winter/summer design for 26 h under real life conditions. The main hypothesis was tested whether distal ST (Tdist)mediates the effect of PET-changes on mean arterial BP (MAP). Diurnal profiles of cardiophysiological variables (including BP), STs and PET were ambulatory recorded. Daytime variations between 0930 and 2030 h were analyzed in detail by intra-individual longitudinal path analysis. Additionally, time segments before, during and after outdoor exposure were separately analyzed. In both seasons short-term variations in PET were positively associated with short-term changes in Tdist (not proximal ST, Tprox) and negatively with those in MAP. However, long-term seasonal differences in daytime mean levels were observed in STs but not in BP leading to non-significant inter-individual correlation between STs and BP. Additionally, higher individual body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with lower daytime mean levels of Tprox and higher MAP suggesting Tprox as potential mediator variable for the association of BMI with MAP. In healthy young women the thermoregulatory and BP-regulatory systems are closely linked with respect to short-term, but not long-term changes in PET. One hypothetical explanation could serve recent findings that thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is activated in a cool environment, which could be responsible for the counter-regulation of cold induced increase of BP in winter leading to no seasonal differences in MAP.

The neural representations of four mechanical systems were assessed before, during, and after three phases of incremental instruction (which first provided information about the system components, then provided partial causal information, and finally provided full functional information). In 14 participants, the neural representations of four systems (a bathroom scale, a fire extinguisher, an automobile braking system, and a trumpet) were assessed using three recently developed techniques: (1) machine learning and classification of multi-voxel patterns; (2) localization of consistently responding voxels; and (3) representational similarity analysis (RSA). The neural representations of the systems progressed through four stages, or states, involving spatially and temporally distinct multi-voxel patterns: (1) initially, the representation was primarily visual (occipital cortex); (2) it subsequently included a large parietal component; (3) it eventually became cortically diverse (frontal, parietal, temporal, and medial frontal regions); and (4) at the end, it demonstrated a strong frontal cortex weighting (frontal and motor regions). At each stage of knowledge, it was possible for a classifier to identify which one of four mechanical systems a participant was thinking about, based on their brain activation patterns. The progression of representational states was suggestive of progressive stages of learning: (1) encoding information from the display; (2) mental animation, possibly involving imagining the components moving; (3) generating causal hypotheses associated with mental animation; and finally (4) determining how a person (probably oneself) would interact with the system.

Clinical trials demonstrate that endovascular treatment, such as stenting, may not be suitable for octogenarians with systemic diseases. Hence, less invasive methods for the octogenarian patients are urgently needed. Our previous study (unique identifier: NCT01321749) showed that repetitive bilateral arm ischemic preconditioning (BAIPC) reduced the incidence of stroke recurrence by improving cerebral perfusion (confirmed by single photon emission computed tomography and transcranial Doppler sonography) in patients younger than 80 years of age; however, the safety and effectiveness of BAIPC on stroke prevention in octo- and nonagenarians with SIAS are still unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of BAIPC in reducing stroke recurrence in octo- and nonagenarian patients with SIAS. Fifty-eight patients with SIAS were enrolled in this randomized controlled prospective study for 180 consecutive days. All patients enrolled in the study received standard medical management. Patients in the BAIPC group (n = 30) underwent 5 cycles consisting of bilateral arm ischemia followed by reperfusion for 5 min each twice daily. Those in the control group (n = 28) underwent sham-BAIPC twice daily. Blood pressure, heart rate, local skin status, plasma myoglobin, and plasma levels of thrombotic and inflammatory markers were documented in both groups before beginning the study and for the first 30 days. Finally, the incidences of stroke recurrence and magnetic resonance imaging during the 180 days of treatment were compared. Compared with the control, BAIPC had no adverse effects on blood pressure, heart rate, local skin integrity, or plasma myoglobin, and did not induce cerebral hemorrhage in the studied cohort. BAIPC reduced plasma high sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, leukocyte count, and platelet aggregation rate and elevated plasma tissue plasminogen activator (all p < 0.01). In 180 days, 2 infarctions and 7 transient ischemic attacks were observed in the BAIPC group compared with 8 infarctions and 11 transient ischemic attacks in the sham BAIPC group (p < 0.05). BAIPC may safely inhibit stroke recurrence, protect against brain ischemia, and ameliorate plasma biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation in octo- and nonagenarians with SIAS.

Epub 2015 Aug 7.","Evolution has provided us with a highly flexible neuroendocrine threat system which, depending on threat imminence, switches between active escape and passive freezing. Cortisol, the ""stress-hormone"", is thought to play an important role in both fear behaviors, but the exact mechanisms are not understood. Using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging we investigated how cortisol modulates the brain's fear systems when humans are under virtual-predator attack. We show dissociated neural effects of cortisol depending on whether escape from threat is possible. During inescapable threat cortisol reduces fear-related midbrain activity, whereas in anticipation of active escape cortisol boosts activity in the frontal salience network (insula and anterior cingulate cortex), which is involved in autonomic control, visceral perception and motivated action. Our findings suggest that cortisol adjusts the human neural threat system from passive fear to active escape, which illuminates the hormone's crucial role in the adaptive flexibility of fear behaviors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26248899,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

OBJECTIVE: To explore the short-term metabolic, brain, cognitive, and functional effects of exercise following stroke. METHODS: A total of 40 participants (>50 years, >6 months post stroke, independently mobile) were recruited to a single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial of community-based exercise (19 weeks, 3 times/wk, ""exercise"" group) or stretching (""control"" group). Primary outcome measures were glucose control and cerebral blood flow. Secondary outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness, blood pressure, lipid profile, body composition, cerebral tissue atrophy and regional brain metabolism, and physical and cognitive function. RESULTS: Exercise did not change glucose control (homeostasis model assessment 1.5 +/- 0.8 to 1.5 +/- 0.7 vs 1.6 +/- 0.8 to 1.7 +/- 0.7, P = .97; CI = -0.5 to 0.49). Medial temporal lobe tissue blood flow increased with exercise (38 +/- 8 to 42 +/- 10 mL/100 g/min; P < .05; CI = 9.0 to 0.1) without any change in gray matter tissue volume. There was no change in medial temporal lobe tissue blood flow in the control group (41 +/- 8 to 40 +/- 7 mL/100 g/min; P = .13; CI = -3.6 to 6.7) but significant gray matter atrophy. Cardiorespiratory fitness, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, physical function, and cognition also improved with exercise.

Intolerance of uncertainty predicts fear extinction in amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortical circuitry,Biol Mood Anxiety Disord,"Morriss, Jayne,Christakou, Anastasia,van Reekum, Carien M,eng,England,Biol Mood Anxiety Disord. 2015 Jul 10;5:4. doi: 10.1186/s13587-015-0019-8. eCollection 2015.","BACKGROUND: Coordination of activity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is important for fear-extinction learning. Aberrant recruitment of this circuitry is associated with anxiety disorders. Here, we sought to determine if individual differences in future threat uncertainty sensitivity, a potential risk factor for anxiety disorders, underly compromised recruitment of fear extinction circuitry. Twenty-two healthy subjects completed a cued fear conditioning task with acquisition and extinction phases. During the task, pupil dilation, skin conductance response, and functional magnetic resonance imaging were acquired. We assessed the temporality of fear extinction learning by splitting the extinction phase into early and late extinction. Threat uncertainty sensitivity was measured using self-reported intolerance of uncertainty (IU). RESULTS: During early extinction learning, we found low IU scores to be associated with larger skin conductance responses and right amygdala activity to learned threat vs. safety cues, whereas high IU scores were associated with no skin conductance discrimination and greater activity within the right amygdala to previously learned safety cues. In late extinction learning, low IU scores were associated with successful inhibition of previously learned threat, reflected in comparable skin conductance response and right amgydala activity to learned threat vs. safety cues, whilst high IU scores were associated with continued fear expression to learned threat, indexed by larger skin conductance and amygdala activity to threat vs. safety cues. In addition, high IU scores were associated with greater vmPFC activity to threat vs. safety cues in late extinction. Similar patterns of IU and extinction learning were found for pupil dilation. The results were specific for IU and did not generalize to self-reported trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the neural and psychophysiological patterns observed here suggest high IU individuals to disproportionately generalize threat during times of uncertainty, which subsequently compromises fear extinction learning. More broadly, these findings highlight the potential of intolerance of uncertainty-based mechanisms to help understand pathological fear in anxiety disorders and inform potential treatment targets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161254,Y,corr,uns,,

Epub 2014 Feb 26.","BACKGROUND: Dysfunction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders. Leading neurocircuitry models of these disorders propose that hypoactivity in the vmPFC engenders disinhibited activity of the amygdala and, consequently, pathologically elevated levels of negative affect. This model predicts that a selective loss or diminution of function of the vmPFC would result in heightened activity of the amygdala. Although this prediction has been borne out in rodent lesion and electrophysiologic studies using fear conditioning and extinction paradigms, there has not yet been a definitive test of this prediction in humans. METHODS: We tested this prediction through a novel use of functional magnetic resonance imaging in four neurosurgical patients with focal, bilateral vmPFC damage. RESULTS: Relative to neurologically healthy comparison subjects, the patients with vmPFC lesions exhibited potentiated amygdala responses to aversive images and elevated resting-state amygdala functional connectivity. No comparable group differences were observed for activity in other brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide unique evidence for the critical role of the vmPFC in regulating activity of the amygdala in humans and help elucidate the causal neural interactions that underlie mental illness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673881,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,
Cortical Representation of Afferent Bodily Signals in Borderline Personality Disorder: Neural Correlates and Relationship to Emotional Dysregulation,JAMA Psychiatry,"Muller, Laura E,Schulz, Andre,Andermann, Martin,Gabel, Andrea,Gescher, Dorothee Maria,Spohn, Angelika,Herpertz, Sabine C,Bertsch, Katja,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,JAMA Psychiatry. 2015 Nov;72(11):1077-86. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.1252.","IMPORTANCE: The ability to perceive and regulate one's own emotions has been tightly linked to the processing of afferent bodily signals (interoception). Thus, disturbed interoception might contribute to the core feature of emotional dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD), as increased levels of depersonalization, body image disturbances, and reduced sensitivity to physical pain suggest poor body awareness in BPD. OBJECTIVE: To determine neural correlates of disturbed body awareness in BPD and its associations with emotional dysregulation and to explore improvements in body awareness with BPD symptom remission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study performed at Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. Heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs), an indicator of the cortical representation of afferent signals from the cardiovascular system, were investigated in 34 medication-free patients with BPD, 31 healthy volunteers, and 17 medication-free patients with BPD in remission. The HEPs were assessed using 5-minute resting-state electroencephalograms and parallel electrocardiograms. Core BPD symptoms, history of childhood traumatization, and psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of self-reports and structured interviews. To measure neural correlates of disturbed body awareness, high-resolution T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest-based approaches. The study was performed between 2012 and 2014, and data analysis was performed in 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean HEP amplitudes in resting-state electroencephalograms and their correlation with self-reported emotional dysregulation, as well as with gray matter volume. RESULTS: Patients with BPD had significantly reduced mean HEP amplitudes compared with healthy volunteers (F1,61 = 11.32, P = .001), whereas the mean HEP amplitudes of patients with BDP in remission lie somewhere in between these 2 groups of participants (P > .05). The HEP amplitudes were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation (R = -0.30, P = .01) and positively associated with gray matter volume in the left anterior insula (R = 0.53, P < .05) and the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (R = 0.47, P < .05), 2 structures that have been identified as core regions for interoception. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results indicate state-dependent deficits in the cortical processing of bodily signals in patients with BPD, which appear to be associated with core features of BPD. The analysis of patients with BPD in remission suggests an improvement in cortical representation of bodily signals with symptom remission. Results recommend the integration of techniques to strengthen bodily awareness in psychotherapeutic interventions of BPD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26376409,N,eeg,,,

Epub 2015 Jan 28.","Isometric handgrip is commonly used in stress research because the task reliably increases sympathetic arousal. Various handgrip protocols have been used; they vary in handgrip strength, duration of grip, and the number of cycles of handgrip and rest. However, most protocols require the calibration of a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) prior to the handgrip task, which is not always convenient (i.e., in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study). Here, we wanted to test whether two handgrip protocols with different strength, duration and cycle protocols would reliably elicit sympathetic arousal in the absence of calibrating an MVC. Sixty-two healthy naturally cycling women and women on hormonal contraception participated in one of the two isometric handgrip protocols using a hand therapy ball of medium resistance. Women completed one of the following handgrip protocols: 1) 30% of a perceived maximum voluntary contraction for 3 min or 2) 3 cycles of maximum voluntary contraction for 18s with a one minute rest in between. All handgrip blocks were counterbalanced with a control condition. Sympathetic arousal was measured throughout the session via pupil diameter changes and salivary alpha-amylase. Results indicate that in the absence of calibrating an MVC, the handgrip tasks elicited different changes in sympathetic arousal. Pupil dilation responses increased significantly in the handgrip versus control blocks only in participants in the 18-s protocol. Additionally, more participants exhibited a salivary alpha-amylase response to the handgrip block in the 18-s condition compared to the 3-min condition. Thus, these results suggest that neuroimaging and behavioral studies with isometric handgrip should be able to successfully induce sympathetic nervous activity with the 18-s paradigm, regardless of the handgrip device and the ability to calibrate an MVC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637170,N,no brain data,,,Y

Many kinesiological studies have investigated muscle actions, but the metabolic activity of muscles in stroke patients remains to be investigated. We therefore evaluated energy consumption in lower extremity muscles during level walking in hemiparetic individuals. Glucose uptake was measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in eight hemiparetic (mean age: 56 years) and 11 healthy (mean age: 26 years) participants. Standardized uptake ratio (SUR) was computed in each muscle to express the (18)F-FDG-uptake level. SUR was compared across gluteal, thigh, and lower leg muscles and across individual muscles within each muscle group. For each muscle, SUR was compared among the paretic limb of hemiparetic participants, the non-paretic limb of hemiparetic participants, and the right limb of healthy participants. In paretic limbs, mean SUR did not differ between the three muscle groups, or between individual muscles within each muscle group. SURs of paretic lower leg muscles and gluteus minimus muscle were significantly smaller than those of non-paretic limb and healthy participants (p < 0.05). In the non-paretic limb of hemiparetic participants, SUR of the lower leg muscles was larger than that of the thigh muscles (p < 0.05). Unexpectedly, SURs of medial hamstring and posterior tibial muscles were larger in the non-paretic limb of hemiparetic participants, compared to the right limb of healthy participants (p < 0.05).

Epub 2015 Feb 12.","BACKGROUND/AIM: Increased dopamine production may be a feature of head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL). 18F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography scintigraphy has a high sensitivity for detecting HNPGLs. These observations strongly suggest that HNPGLs have the capacity for L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine uptake and conversion towards dopamine. Therefore, our aim was to demonstrate the presence of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes, i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in HNPGL tissue. METHODS: A single-center study was performed among patients who underwent surgery for HNPGL at a single university referral center between 1994 and 2012. HNPGL tissue was immunohistochemically stained for TH, AADC and DBH. Data on paraganglioma-associated germline mutations, preoperative biochemical phenotype and imaging studies were retrieved. Catecholamine excess was defined as preoperative plasma and/or urinary levels of metanephrine, normetanephrine or 3-methoxytyramine above the upper reference limit. RESULTS: Nineteen HNPGLs from 18 patients were evaluated. All tumor tissues (100%) stained positive for AADC, 6 (32%) for TH and 2 (11%) for DBH. Of 3 HNPGLs staining positive for DBH, 2 were also positive for AADC and TH. Catecholamine excess was only present in 1 patient (5%). The HNPGLs of this single patient only showed positive staining for AADC.

Less is known about the differential contribution of these midbrain regions to appetitive versus aversive learning, especially in humans. Here we scanned human participants with high-resolution fMRI focused on the SN and VTA while they participated in a sequential Pavlovian conditioning paradigm involving an appetitive outcome (a pleasant juice), as well as an aversive outcome (an unpleasant bitter and salty flavor). We found a degree of regional specialization within the SN: Whereas a region of ventromedial SN correlated with a temporal difference reward prediction error during appetitive Pavlovian learning, a dorsolateral area correlated instead with an aversive expected value signal in response to the most distal cue, and to a reward prediction error in response to the most proximal cue to the aversive outcome. Furthermore, participants' affective reactions to both the appetitive and aversive conditioned stimuli more than 1 year after the fMRI experiment was conducted correlated with activation in the ventromedial and dorsolateral SN obtained during the experiment, respectively. These findings suggest that, whereas the human ventromedial SN contributes to long-term learning about rewards, the dorsolateral SN may be particularly important for long-term learning in aversive contexts. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The role of the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in appetitive learning is well established, but less is known about their contribution to aversive compared with appetitive learning, especially in humans. We used high-resolution fMRI to measure activity in the SN and VTA while participants underwent higher-order Pavlovian learning. We found a regional specialization within the SN: a ventromedial area was selectively engaged during appetitive learning, and a dorsolateral area during aversive learning. Activity in these areas predicted affective reactions to appetitive and aversive conditioned stimuli over 1 year later. These findings suggest that, whereas the human ventromedial SN contributes to long-term learning about rewards, the dorsolateral SN may be particularly important for long-term learning in aversive contexts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26490862,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, the ecological validity of these findings as well as the influence of the encoding context are still unclear. To tackle these questions, three different groups of subjects participated in the current study. Two groups of guilty subjects encoded critical details either only by planning (guilty intention group) or by really enacting (guilty action group) a complex, realistic mock crime. In addition, a group of informed innocent subjects encoded half of the relevant details in a neutral context. Univariate analyses showed robust activation differences between known relevant compared to neutral details in the previously identified ventral frontal-parietal network with no differences between experimental groups. Moreover, validity estimates for average changes in neural activity were similar between groups when focusing on the known details and did not differ substantially from the validity of electrodermal recordings. Additional multivariate analyses provided evidence for differential patterns of activity in the ventral fronto-parietal network between the guilty action and the informed innocent group and yielded higher validity coefficients for the detection of crime related knowledge when relying on whole brain data. Together, these findings demonstrate that an fMRI-based CIT enables the accurate detection of concealed crime related memories, largely independent of encoding context. On the one hand, this indicates that even persons who planned a (mock) crime could be validly identified as having specific crime related knowledge. On the other hand, innocents with such knowledge have a high risk of failing the test, at least when considering univariate changes of neural activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819306,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2015 Apr 2.","The existence of residual stresses in human arteries has long been shown experimentally. Researchers have also demonstrated that residual stresses have a significant effect on the distribution of physiological stresses within arterial tissues, and hence on their development, e.g., stress-modulated remodeling. Through progress in medical imaging, image analysis and finite element (FE) meshing tools it is now possible to construct in vivo patient-specific geometries and thus to study specific, clinically relevant problems in arterial mechanics via FE simulations. Classical continuum mechanics and FE methods assume that constitutive models and the corresponding simulations start from unloaded, stress-free reference configurations while the boundary-value problem of interest represents a loaded geometry and includes residual stresses. We present a pragmatic methodology to simultaneously account for both (i) the three-dimensional (3-D) residual stress distributions in the arterial tissue layers, and (ii) the equilibrium of the in vivo patient-specific geometry with the known boundary conditions. We base our methodology on analytically determined residual stress distributions (Holzapfel and Ogden, 2010, J. R. Soc. Interface 7, 787-799) and calibrate it using data on residual deformations (Holzapfel et al., 2007, Ann. Biomed. Eng. 35, 530-545). We demonstrate our methodology on three patient-specific FE simulations calibrated using experimental data. All data employed here are generated from human tissues - both the aorta and thrombus, and their respective layers - including the geometries determined from magnetic resonance images, and material properties and 3-D residual stretches determined from mechanical experiments. We study the effect of 3-D residual stresses on the distribution of physiological stresses in the aortic layers (intima, media, adventitia) and the layers of the intraluminal thrombus (luminal, medial, abluminal) by comparing three types of FE simulations: (i) conventional calculations; (ii) calculations accounting only for prestresses; (iii) calculations including both 3-D residual stresses and prestresses. Our results show that including residual stresses in patient-specific simulations of arterial tissues significantly impacts both the global (organ-level) deformations and the stress distributions within the arterial tissue (and its layers). Our method produces circumferential Cauchy stress distributions that are more uniform through the tissue thickness (i.e., smaller stress gradients in the local radial directions) compared to both the conventional and prestressing calculations. Such methods, combined with appropriate experimental data, aim at increasing the accuracy of classical FE analyses for patient-specific studies in computational biomechanics and may lead to increased clinical application of simulation tools.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25931035,N,no brain data,,,

The aims of this study were to characterize differences in sensorimotor functional connectivity in individuals with NSLBP and to investigate whether the patterns of sensorimotor functional connectivity underlie the impaired STSTS performance. Seventeen individuals with NSLBP and 17 healthy controls were instructed to perform five consecutive STSTS movements as fast as possible. Based on the center of pressure displacement, the total duration of the STSTS task was determined. In addition, resting-state functional connectivity images were acquired and analyzed on a multivariate level using both functional connectivity density mapping and independent component analysis. Individuals with NSLBP needed significantly more time to perform the STSTS task compared to healthy controls. In addition, decreased resting-state functional connectivity of brain areas related to the integration of sensory and/or motor information was shown in the individuals with NSLBP. Moreover, the decreased functional connectivity at rest of the left precentral gyrus and lobule IV and V of the left cerebellum was associated with a longer duration of the STSTS task in both individuals with NSLBP and healthy controls. In summary, individuals with NSLBP showed a reorganization of the sensorimotor network at rest, and the functional connectivity of specific sensorimotor areas was associated with the performance of a dynamic sensorimotor task.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25557846,N,no phys of interest,,,

Skin conductance responses and verbal self-reports of arousal, valence, and contingency were recorded. RESULTS: We found that PAC1-R modulates the blood oxygenation level-dependent response of the hippocampus. Specifically, we observed decreased hippocampal activity during contextual, but not during cued, fear conditioning in female participants carrying the PAC1-R risk allele. We observed no significant differences in conditionability for skin conductance responses, verbal reports, or activation in other brain regions between the genotype groups in female participants.

Specifically, individuals often consider the reactions of other people when evaluating the meaning and impact of an emotional stimulus. It has not yet been investigated, however, how emotional arousal ratings and physiological responses elicited by affective stimuli are influenced by the rating of an interaction partner. In the present study, pairs of participants were asked to rate and communicate the degree of their emotional arousal while viewing affective pictures. Strikingly, participants adjusted their arousal ratings to match up with their interaction partner. In anticipation of the affective picture, the interaction partner's arousal ratings correlated positively with activity in anterior insula and prefrontal cortex. During picture presentation, social influence was reflected in the ventral striatum, that is, activity in the ventral striatum correlated negatively with the interaction partner's ratings. Results of the study show that emotional alignment through the influence of another person's communicated experience has to be considered as a complex phenomenon integrating different components including emotion anticipation and conformity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795436,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

METHODS: Resting-state fMRI scans of 21 patients with CH were obtained (13 with right-sided headache and 8 with left-sided headache) and 21 age- and sex-matched normal controls. The resting-state fMRI data were analyzed using independent component analysis to identify the group differences of hypothalamic-SN coactivation between the patients with CH and healthy controls. RESULTS: Decreased functional coactivation was detected between the hypothalamus, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the headache side, and the SN both in patients with right-sided CH and in those with left-sided CH. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the decreased hypothalamus-SN coactivation may have a role in CH attacks by the defective central pathway of pain control and autonomic nervous system dysregulation. This helps to gain additional insight into the pathophysiologic basis of CH and the nature of the brain dysfunction in CH.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25746559,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2014 Nov 14.","OBJECT: Despite advances in medical management and endovascular therapies, including the introduction of statins, antiplatelet agents, and drug-eluting stents, some patients experience medically refractory vertebrobasilar insufficiency and may benefit from robust surgical revascularization. The aim of this study was to evaluate such patients after surgical revascularization, emphasizing long-term outcomes and rates of complications. METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified 22 patients (5 women and 17 men) whose mean age was 69.1 years (range 48-81 years) who underwent revascularization of the posterior circulation via a proximal vertebral artery-carotid artery transposition between 2005 and 2013. The patients' conditions before surgery were clinically summarized, and long-term outcomes and complication rates after surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: All the patients were symptomatic before surgery although they received the best medical therapy as defined by their primary care physician. Presenting symptoms consisted of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and/or findings attributable to posterior circulation hypoperfusion. There were no deaths associated with revascularization surgery. The postoperative complication rate was 45.5%, which included 3 cases of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, 1 case of thoracic duct injury, 2 cases of TIA, and 4 cases of Horner's syndrome. The thoracic duct injury was identified intraoperatively and ligated without sequelae, all the TIAs resolved within 24 hours of surgery, all 4 sympathetic plexus injuries resolved, and all but 1 of the recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies resolved, resulting in a 4.5% complication rate in a mean follow-up period of 8.8 months. All the patients had resolution of their presenting symptoms, and a single patient had symptomatic restenosis that required stenting and angioplasty, resulting in a restenosis rate of 4.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the optimization of medical therapies and lifestyle modifications, a select subset of patients with posterior vascular circulation insufficiency remains. In the authors' experience, vertebral artery-carotid artery transposition provides a surgical option with relatively low long-term complication and restenosis rates that are comparable or lower than those reported with endovascular treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25397367,N,no brain data,,,

Afterwards participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging while aversive tension, heart rate and heart rate variability were assessed. RESULTS: We found a significant influence of incision on subjective and objective stress levels with a stronger decrease of aversive tension in the borderline personality disorder group following incision than sham. Amygdala activity decreased more and functional connectivity with superior frontal gyrus normalised after incision in the borderline personality disorder group.

Groups did not differ in looking time, pupilometry, or subjective ratings of faces during reappraisal.

Subjects were studied at 3T MRI using arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure CBF; CVR was measured as a change in % Blood Oxygen Level Dependent signal (as a surrogate of CBF) to repeated 10 mmHg step increase in arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2). RESULTS: MELAS siblings had decreased CVR (p </= 0.002) and increased CBF (p < 0.0026) compared to controls; changes correlated with disease severity and % mutant mtDNA (inversely for CVR: r = -0.82 frontal, r = -0.91 occipital cortex; directly for CBF: r = +0.85 frontal, not for occipital infarct penumbra). Mean CVR was reduced more in frontal (p < 0.001) versus occipital cortex (p = 0.002); mean CBF was increased more in occipital (p = 0.001) than frontal (p = 0.0026) cortices compared to controls. CBF correlated inversely with CVR (r = -0.99 in frontal; not in occipital infarct penumbra) suggesting that increased frontal resting flows are at the expense of flow reserve.

Anticipation allows the organism to prepare its nociceptive system to respond adequately to the subsequent stimulus. The context in which an uncomfortable stimulus is experienced may also influence neural processing. Uncertainty of occurrence, timing and intensity of an aversive event may lead to increased anticipatory anxiety, fear, physiological arousal and sensory perception. We aimed to identify, in healthy volunteers, the effects of uncertainty in the anticipation of uncomfortable rectal distension, and the impact of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and anxiety-related psychological variables on neural mechanisms of anticipation of rectal distension using fMRI. Barostat-controlled uncomfortable rectal distensions were preceded by cued uncertain or certain anticipation in 15 healthy volunteers in a fMRI protocol at 3T. Electrocardiographic data were concurrently registered by MR scanner. The low frequency (LF)-component of the heart rate variability (HRV) time-series was extracted and inserted as a regressor in the fMRI model ('LF-HRV model'). The impact of ANS activity was analyzed by comparing the fMRI signal in the 'standard model' and in the 'LF-HRV model' across the different anticipation and distension conditions. The scores of the psychological questionnaires and the rating of perceived anticipatory anxiety were included as covariates in the fMRI data analysis. Our experiments led to the following key findings: 1) the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) is the only activation site that relates to uncertainty in healthy volunteers and is directly correlated to individual questionnaire score for pain-related anxiety; 2) uncertain anticipation of rectal distension involved several relevant brain regions, namely activation of sgACC and medial prefrontal cortex and deactivation of amygdala, insula, thalamus, secondary somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area and cerebellum; 3) most of the brain activity during anticipation, but not distension, is associated with activity of the central autonomic network. This approach could be applied to study the ANS impact on brain activity in various pathological conditions, namely in patients with chronic digestive conditions characterized by visceral discomfort and ANS imbalance such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25479021,Y,corr,uns,,

To examine the dynamics of this abnormality, we examined within-participant covariation over time between brain activity, cardiac vagal control, and depressive symptoms in depressed patients treated with sertraline and in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Patients with depression and nondepressed control participants were enrolled in a 12-week protocol. After Week 0 assessment, patients began treatment with sertraline. Neural activity and vagal control were measured for all participants at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and 12 using functional magnetic resonance imaging and synchronized electrocardiographic recordings. At each of the four assessments, a moving window analysis was used to estimate vagal control as assessed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) from the electrocardiographic data, which was then regressed onto functional magnetic resonance imaging activity. RESULTS: At baseline, patients showed reduced blood oxygen level-dependent RSA covariation compared with controls within multiple a priori brain regions associated with vagal control, collectively described as the medial visceromotor network (MVN). Sertraline treatment led to a significant increase in brain-RSA covariation for patients compared with controls, despite a lack of improvement in mean RSA. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a partial normalization of MVN dysfunction in depression during sertraline treatment. Specifically, results indicate a partial recovery of MVN function. However, this recovery was insufficient to cause a significant change in RSA levels. These results may help to explain both improvements with and limitations of sertraline treatment of depression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258459,N,mdd,,,

A key imaging tool in characterising functional brain networks is examination of T2*-weighted fMRI signal during rest (resting state fMRI, rs-fMRI). The majority of rs-fMRI studies have concentrated on slow signal fluctuations occurring at <0.1 Hz, even though neuronal rhythms, and haemodynamic responses to these fluctuate more rapidly, and there is emerging evidence for crucial information about functional brain connectivity occurring more rapidly than these limits. The characterisation of higher frequency components has been limited by the sampling frequency achievable with standard T2* echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequences. We describe patterns of neonatal functional brain network connectivity derived using accelerated T2*-weighted EPI MRI. We acquired whole brain rs-fMRI data, at subsecond sampling frequency, from preterm infants at term equivalent age and compared this to rs-fMRI data acquired with standard EPI acquisition protocol. We provide the first evidence that rapid rs-fMRI acquisition in neonates, and adoption of an extended frequency range for analysis, allows identification of a substantial proportion of signal power residing above 0.2 Hz. We thereby describe changes in brain connectivity associated with increasing maturity which are not evident using standard rs-fMRI protocols.

Most often, recognition has been measured as enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs) to probes compared to irrelevant foils (CIT effect). More recently, also differentially enlarged reaction times (RTs) and increased neural activity in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the right temporo-parietal junction have been observed. The aims of the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study were to (1) investigate the boundary conditions of the CIT effects in all three measures and thereby (2) gain more insight into the relative contribution of two mechanisms underlying enhanced responding to concealed information (i.e., orienting versus response inhibition). Therefore, we manipulated the proportion of probe versus irrelevant items, and whether suspects were instructed to actively deny recognition of probe knowledge (i.e., deceive) during the test. Results revealed that whereas overt deception was not necessary for the SCR CIT effect, it was crucial for the RT and the fMRI-based CIT effects. The proportion manipulation enhanced the CIT effect in all three measures. The results indicate that different mental processes might underlie the response pattern in the CIT. While skin conductance responding to concealed information may best be explained by orienting theory, it seems that response inhibition drives RT and blood oxygen level dependent responding to concealed information.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277495,N,no corr,,,

To address this issue we studied one patient with visual extinction following right parietal damage, in a combined behavioral, psychophysiological and neuroimaging experiment. Patient M.P. was presented with neutral and fearful bodily expressions, either unilaterally in the left (LVF) or right visual field (RVF), or in both visual fields simultaneously. Fearful expressions presented in the left visual field simultaneously with neutral bodies in the RVF were detected more often than left-side neutral bodies. Signal detection analysis showed that the preferential access of fearful bodies to visual awareness is related to higher perceptual sensitivity for these stimuli during attentional competition. Pupil dilation, which indexes autonomic arousal, increased for fearful more than for neutral bodies. Moreover, dilation for extinguished fearful bodies was bigger than for consciously perceived fearful bodies. This decoupling between (increased) arousal and (lack of) conscious visual experience argues against a direct relationship between visual awareness of emotional signals and peripheral changes. Neuroimaging results showed that fearful bodies activated the left amygdala and extrastriate cortex when consciously perceived as well as when extinguished. Critically, however, conscious perception of fearful bodies was uniquely associated with activity in the anterior insula, somatosensory, motor and premotor cortex (PMC), and the cerebellum. This suggests that the integration between peripheral arousal and the moment-to-moment mapping at the central neural level of these bodily changes is critical for the conscious visual experience of emotional signals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465122,N,case study,,,

Cortical Abeta depositions were measured by (18)F-florbetapir PET and expressed as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) relative to the cerebellum. Circadian BP profiles were measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring during awake and sleep periods. The dipping status of sleep BP (i.e., the percent changes from the awake BP) was calculated and dichotomized into the dipper (>/=10%) and nondipper (<10%) groups. Dynamic CBF regulation was assessed by a transfer function analysis between beat-to-beat changes in BP and CBF velocity measured from the middle cerebral artery during a repeated sit-stand maneuver. RESULTS: Age was positively correlated with a greater Abeta deposition in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and mean cortex. Accounting for the age effect, attenuated reductions in sleep systolic BP were associated with higher levels of posterior cingulate SUVR.

Transfer function gain between changes in BP and CBF velocity was diminished in the nondippers, and moreover those individuals with a lower gain exhibited a higher SUVR in the posterior cingulate. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuated reductions in sleep BP are associated with a greater Abeta burden in the posterior cingulate and altered dynamic CBF regulation in patients with aMCI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26537049,N,clinical,,,

Epub 2015 Feb 27.","In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research one is typically interested in neural activity. However, the blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is a composite of both neural and vascular activity. As factors such as age or medication may alter vascular function, it is essential to account for changes in neurovascular coupling when investigating neurocognitive functioning with fMRI. The resting-state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA) in the fMRI signal (rsfMRI) has been proposed as an index of vascular reactivity. The RSFA compares favourably with other techniques such as breath-hold and hypercapnia, but the latter are more difficult to perform in some populations, such as older adults. The RSFA is therefore a candidate for use in adjusting for age-related changes in vascular reactivity in fMRI studies. The use of RSFA is predicated on its sensitivity to vascular rather than neural factors; however, the extent to which each of these factors contributes to RSFA remains to be characterized. The present work addressed these issues by comparing RSFA (i.e., rsfMRI variability) to proxy measures of (i) cardiovascular function in terms of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) and (ii) neural activity in terms of resting state magnetoencephalography (rsMEG). We derived summary scores of RSFA, a sensorimotor task BOLD activation, cardiovascular function and rsMEG variability for 335 healthy older adults in the population-based Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience cohort (Cam-CAN; www.cam-can.com). Mediation analysis revealed that the effects of ageing on RSFA were significantly mediated by vascular factors, but importantly not by the variability in neuronal activity. Furthermore, the converse effects of ageing on the rsMEG variability were not mediated by vascular factors. We then examined the effect of RSFA scaling of task-based BOLD in the sensorimotor task. The scaling analysis revealed that much of the effects of age on task-based activation studies with fMRI do not survive correction for changes in vascular reactivity, and are likely to have been overestimated in previous fMRI studies of ageing. The results from the mediation analysis demonstrate that RSFA is modulated by measures of vascular function and is not driven solely by changes in the variance of neural activity. Based on these findings we propose that the RSFA scaling method is articularly useful in large scale and longitudinal neuroimaging studies of ageing, or with frail participants, where alternative measures of vascular reactivity are impractical.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727740,M,mediation?,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 23.","Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells have recently been shown highly relevant to the non-image forming effects of light, through their direct projections on brain circuits that regulate alertness, mood and circadian rhythms. A quantitative assessment of functionality of the melanopsin-signaling pathway could be highly relevant in order to mechanistically understand individual differences in the effects of light on these regulatory systems. We here propose and validate a reliable quantification of the melanopsin-dependent Post-Illumination Pupil Response (PIPR) after blue light, and evaluated its sensitivity to dark adaptation, time of day, body posture, and light exposure history. Pupil diameter of the left eye was continuously measured during a series of light exposures to the right eye, of which the pupil was dilated using tropicamide 0.5%. The light exposure paradigm consisted of the following five consecutive blocks of five minutes: baseline dark; monochromatic red light (peak wavelength: 630 nm, luminance: 375 cd/m(2)) to maximize the effect of subsequent blue light; dark; monochromatic blue light (peak wavelength: 470 nm, luminance: 375 cd/m(2)); and post-blue dark. PIPR was quantified as the difference between baseline dark pupil diameter and post-blue dark pupil diameter (PIPR-mm). In addition, a relative PIPR was calculated by dividing PIPR by baseline pupil diameter (PIPR-%). In total 54 PIPR assessments were obtained in 25 healthy young adults (10 males, mean age +/- SD: 26.9 +/- 4.0 yr). From repeated measurements on two consecutive days in 15 of the 25 participants (6 males, mean age +/- SD: 27.8 +/- 4.3 yrs) test-retest reliability of both PIPR outcome parameters was calculated. In the presence of considerable between-subject differences, both outcome parameters had very high test-retest reliability: Cronbach's alpha > 0.90 and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient > 0.85. In 12 of the 25 participants (6 males, mean age +/- SD: 26.5 +/- 3.6 yr) we examined the potential confounding effects of dark adaptation, time of the day (morning vs. afternoon), body posture (upright vs. supine position), and 24-h environmental light history on the PIPR assessment. Mixed effect regression models were used to analyze these possible confounders. A supine position caused larger PIPR-mm (beta = 0.29 mm, SE = 0.10, p = 0.01) and PIPR-% (beta = 4.34%, SE = 1.69, p = 0.02), which was due to an increase in baseline dark pupil diameter; this finding is of relevance for studies requiring a supine posture, as in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, constant routine protocols, and bed-ridden patients. There were no effects of dark adaptation, time of day, and light history. In conclusion, the presented method provides a reliable and robust assessment of the PIPR to allow for studies on individual differences in melanopsin-based phototransduction and effects of interventions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209783,N,methods paper,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Signal fluctuations in high resolution (1 mm isotropic) 7T fMRI data were attributed to one of the following categories: task-induced BOLD changes, slow drift, signal changes correlated with the cardiac and respiratory cycles, signal changes related to the cardiac rate and respiratory volume per unit of time or other. [Formula: see text] values for all categories were compared across regions of interest. RESULTS: In this high-resolution data, signal fluctuations related to the phase of the cardiac cycle and cardiac rate were shown to be significant, but comparable between cerebellar and cerebral regions of interest. However, respiratory related signal fluctuations were increased in the cerebellar regions, with explained variances that were up to 80 % higher than for the primary motor cortex region. CONCLUSION: Even at a millimetre spatial resolution, significant correlations with both cardiac and respiratory RETROICOR components were found in all healthy volunteer data. Therefore, physiological noise correction is highly likely to improve the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for cerebellar fMRI at 7T, even at high spatial resolution.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25894812,N,methods paper,,,

Research on fMRI related anxiety is limited as to date, therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the changes in anxiety as well as to examine its interactions with the implementation of a dedicated patient preparation phase prior to the examination. METHODS: An fMRI examination consisting of six paradigms was performed on nine female and nine male healthy volunteers. Prior to the examination, the volunteers were subject to an extensive patient preparation phase including the professional support of a psychologist. The volunteers were subject to the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) pre and post fMRI. Blood pressure and heart rate were also measured pre and post fMRI examination. RESULTS: A high level of trait and state anxiety was observed (STAI-T: 41.67 +/- 8.96; STAI-S: 34.78 +/- 9.79) prior to the examination. The level of state anxiety decreased significantly following the examination (STAI-S: 28.83 +/- 4.99, p<0.01). Correlation between the volunteers level of anxiety prior to the fMRI scan and the volume of the activation areas was observed in the fingertapping (r=0.656; 0.561) and word generation (r=0.471) paradigms. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the contribution of a supportive patient preparation phase inclusive of professional guidance to help reduce the volunteers' level of distress and anxiety.

Representational similarity analysis offers a preview of the noradrenergic modulation of long-term fear memory at the time of encoding,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Visser, Renee M,Kunze, Anna E,Westhoff, Bianca,Scholte, H Steven,Kindt, Merel,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,England,Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2015 May;55:8-20. doi: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.01.021. Epub 2015 Feb 3.","Neuroimaging research on emotional memory has greatly advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. While the behavioral expression of fear at the time of encoding does not predict whether an aversive experience will evolve into long-term fear memory, the application of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) for the analysis of BOLD-MRI data has recently provided a unique marker for memory formation. Here, we aimed to further investigate the utility of this marker by modulating the strength of fear memory with an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist (yohimbine HCl). Fifty-two healthy participants were randomly assigned to two conditions - either receiving 20mg yohimbine or a placebo pill (double-blind) - prior to differential fear conditioning and MRI-scanning. We examined the strength of fear associations during acquisition and retention of fear (48 h later) by assessing the similarity of BOLD-MRI patterns and pupil dilation responses. Additionally, participants returned for a follow-up test outside the scanner (2-4 weeks), during which we assessed fear-potentiated startle responses. Replicating our previous findings, neural pattern similarity reflected the development of fear associations over time, and unlike average activation or pupil dilation, predicted the later expression of fear memory (pupil dilation 48 h later). While no effect of yohimbine was observed on markers of autonomic arousal, including salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), we obtained indirect evidence for the noradrenergic enhancement of fear memory consolidation: sAA levels showed a strong increase prior to fMRI scanning, irrespective of whether participants had received yohimbine, and this increase correlated with the subsequent expression of fear (48 h later). Remarkably, this noradrenergic enhancement of fear was associated with changes in neural response patterns at the time of learning. These findings provide further evidence that representational similarity analysis is a sensitive tool for studying (enhanced) memory formation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705798,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Epub 2014 Oct 30.","Two research lines argue for rapid stress-induced reallocations of neural network activity involving the amygdala. One focuses on the role of norepinephrine (NE) in mediating a shift towards the salience network and improving vigilance processing, whereas the other focuses on the role of cortisol in enhancing automatic, habitual responses. It has been suggested that the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is critical in shifting towards habitual responses, which are supported by the dorsal striatum. However, until now it remained unclear whether these two reallocations of neural recourses might be part of the same phenomenon and develop immediately after stress onset. We combined methods used in both approaches and hypothesized specifically that stress would lead to rapidly enhanced involvement of the striatum as assessed by amygala-striatal connectivity. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that this shift depends on cortisol interacting with the MR, by using a randomized, placebo-controlled, full-factorial, between-subjects design with the factors stress and MR-blockade (spironolactone). We investigated 101 young, healthy men using functional magnetic resonance imaging after stress induction, which led to increased negative mood, heart rate, and cortisol levels. We confirmed our hypothesis by revealing a stress-by-MR-blockade interaction on the functional connectivity between the centromedial amygdala (CMA) and the dorsal striatum. Stress rapidly enhanced CMA-striatal connectivity and this effect was correlated with the stress-induced cortisol response, but required MR availability. This finding might suggest that the stress-induced shift described by distinct research lines might capture different aspects of the same phenomenon, ie, a reallocation of neural resources coordinated by both NE and cortisol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25355243,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Here we hypothesized that chronic heavy drinking facilitates this energy substrate shift both for baseline and stimulation conditions. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of alcohol intoxication (0.75 g/kg alcohol vs placebo) on brain glucose metabolism during video stimulation (VS) versus when given with no stimulation (NS), in 25 heavy drinkers (HDs) and 23 healthy controls, each of whom underwent four PET-(18)FDG scans. We showed that resting whole-brain glucose metabolism (placebo-NS) was lower in HD than controls (13%, p = 0.04); that alcohol (compared with placebo) decreased metabolism more in HD (20 +/- 13%) than controls (9 +/- 11%, p = 0.005) and in proportion to daily alcohol consumption (r = 0.36, p = 0.01) but found that alcohol did not reduce the metabolic increases in visual cortex from VS in either group. Instead, VS reduced alcohol-induced decreases in whole-brain glucose metabolism (10 +/- 12%) compared with NS in both groups (15 +/- 13%, p = 0.04), consistent with stimulation-related glucose metabolism enhancement. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., acetate) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (presumably shifting to acetate or other ketones) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25698759,N,no phys of interest,,,

Like other wake-promoting drugs (stimulants and modafinil), caffeine enhances dopamine (DA) signaling in the brain, which it does predominantly by antagonizing adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR). However, it is unclear if caffeine, at the doses consumed by humans, increases DA release or whether it modulates the functions of postsynaptic DA receptors through its interaction with adenosine receptors, which modulate them. We used positron emission tomography and [(11)C]raclopride (DA D2/D3 receptor radioligand sensitive to endogenous DA) to assess if caffeine increased DA release in striatum in 20 healthy controls. Caffeine (300 mg p.o.) significantly increased the availability of D2/D3 receptors in putamen and ventral striatum, but not in caudate, when compared with placebo. In addition, caffeine-induced increases in D2/D3 receptor availability in the ventral striatum were associated with caffeine-induced increases in alertness. Our findings indicate that in the human brain, caffeine, at doses typically consumed, increases the availability of DA D2/D3 receptors, which indicates that caffeine does not increase DA in the striatum for this would have decreased D2/D3 receptor availability. Instead, we interpret our findings to reflect an increase in D2/D3 receptor levels in striatum with caffeine (or changes in affinity). The association between increases in D2/D3 receptor availability in ventral striatum and alertness suggests that caffeine might enhance arousal, in part, by upregulating D2/D3 receptors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25871974,N,no phys of interest,,,

Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) effectively modulates cortical excitability. We therefore hypothesised that a single session of tDCS targeting the sensory cortices would alter the cortical response to tactile stimuli. This hypothesis was tested with a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol designed to quantify the blood oxygen level-dependent response to controlled sinusoidal pressure stimulation applied to the right foot sole, as compared with rest, in 16 healthy young adults. Following sham tDCS, right foot sole stimulation was associated with activation bilaterally within the precentral cortex, postcentral cortex, middle and superior frontal gyri, temporal lobe (subgyral) and cingulate gyrus. Activation was also observed in the left insula, middle temporal lobe, superior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus and thalamus, as well as the right inferior parietal lobule and claustrum (false discovery rate corrected, P < 0.05). To explore the regional effects of tDCS, brain regions related to somatosensory processing, and cortical areas underneath each tDCS electrode, were chosen as regions of interest. Real tDCS, as compared with sham tDCS, increased the percent signal change associated with foot stimulation relative to rest in the left posterior paracentral lobule. These results indicate that tDCS acutely modulated the cortical responsiveness to controlled foot pressure stimuli in healthy adults. Further study is warranted, in both healthy individuals and patients with sensory impairments, to link tDCS-induced modulation of the cortical response to tactile stimuli with changes in somatosensory perception.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25989209,N,tdcs,,,

The (18)F label facilitates the imaging advantages of PET over SPECT technology while allowing centralized manufacturing. Highly specific neural uptake of (18)F-LMI1195 has previously been established, but the retention kinetics are not yet fully understood. METHODS: Healthy New Zealand White rabbits were studied with (18)F-LMI1195 using a small-animal PET system. Dynamic 40-min chest scans were started just before intravenous bolus injection of (18)F-LMI1195. Imaging was performed under norepinephrine transport inhibition with desipramine pretreatment, a 1.5 mg/kg desipramine chase administered 10 min after tracer injection, and saline treatment of controls. As a reference, cardiac uptake of (11)C-hydroxyephedrine and (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) was examined by PET and planar scintigraphy, respectively. RESULTS: Cardiac uptake of all 3 tracers was inhibited by pretreatment with desipramine. Stable cardiac tracer retention was delineated by dynamic PET in control rabbits for (11)C-hydroxyephedrine (washout rate, 0.42% +/- 0.57%/min) and (18)F-LMI1195 (washout rate, 0.058% +/- 0.28%/min).

To better understand the effect of predictability and controllability on threat-related brain activity in humans, two groups of healthy volunteers participated in a yoked Pavlovian fear conditioning study during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Threat predictability was manipulated by presenting an aversive unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that was either preceded by a conditioned stimulus (i.e., predictable) or by presenting the UCS alone (i.e., unpredictable). Similar to animal model research that has employed yoked fear conditioning procedures, one group (controllable condition; CC), but not the other group (uncontrollable condition; UC) was able to terminate the UCS. The fMRI signal response within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and posterior cingulate was diminished during predictable compared to unpredictable threat (i.e., UCS). In addition, threat-related activity within the ventromedial PFC and bilateral hippocampus was diminished only to threats that were both predictable and controllable. These findings provide insight into how threat predictability and controllability affects the activity of brain regions (i.e., ventromedial PFC and hippocampus) involved in emotion regulation, and may have important implications for better understanding neural processes that mediate emotional resilience to stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149610,Y,corr,uns,,

Hence, we investigated whether poorly controlled cholesterol impairs functional connectivity among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Resting-state functional connectivity infers to an interregional cooperation characterized by synchronous and low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) fluctuations on blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used resting-state fMRI to investigate the functional connectivity of 25 T2DM patients with poorly controlled cholesterol, 22 patients with target cholesterol and 26 healthy controls. Further correlation analysis was conducted between the functional connectivity and clinical data as well as neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: The three groups did not statistically differ in age, sex, education level, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting C-peptides, and triglyceride. Compared with target cholesterol patients, patients with poorly controlled cholesterol showed significantly increased levels of serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and LDL/high-density lipoproteins (HDL) ratio, as well as poor performance in Trail Making Test B (TMT-B) (p<0.05). Disordered functional connectivity of bilateral hippocampus-middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in the poorly controlled group consistently existed when compared with the two other groups. Moreover, the aberrant functional connectivity was associated with the TMT-B scores and the LDL/HDL index in T2DM patients with poorly controlled cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM patients with poorly controlled cholesterol showed impaired attention and executive function. The resting-state connectivity disturbance of the hippocampus-MFG may be involved in this process.

Epub 2014 Nov 13.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The benefit of strict blood pressure (BP) control in high-risk patients with symptomatic major cerebral artery disease and misery perfusion (MP) is controversial. Our purposes were (1) to determine whether MP is a predictor of a 5-year risk of subsequent stroke and (2) to investigate the relationships among BP during follow-up, MP, and the stroke risk. METHODS: We studied 130 nondisabled patients with symptomatic major cerebral artery disease. Baseline hemodynamic measurements were obtained from (15)O-gas positron emission tomography, and patients received medical treatment and they were followed for 5 years or until stroke recurrence or death. RESULTS: During 5 years, strokes occurred in 6 of 16 patients with MP and in 15 of 114 without MP (log-rank test; P<0.01). There were 4 (25%) ipsilateral ischemic strokes in patients with MP and 4 in those without MP (P<0.001). The risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke declined markedly after 2 years, and there was only 1 ipsilateral ischemic stroke in a patient without MP. Normal systolic BP (<130 mm Hg) was associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral ischemic strokes in patients with impaired perfusion (including MP), whereas systolic BP outside the 130 to 149 mm Hg range was associated with an increased risk of all strokes in patients without MP. CONCLUSION: Patients with MP showed a high-5-year stroke recurrence, but a large part of the 5-year stroke risk disappeared after 2 years. Aggressive BP control may be hazardous in patients with impaired perfusion, including MP.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25395413,N,clinical,,,
Coupling between pupil fluctuations and resting-state fMRI uncovers a slow build-up of antagonistic responses in the human cortex,Neuroimage,"Yellin, Dov,Berkovich-Ohana, Aviva,Malach, Rafael,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Neuroimage. 2015 Feb 1;106:414-27. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.11.034. Epub 2014 Nov 20.","Even in absence of overt tasks, the human cortex manifests rich patterns of spontaneous ""resting state"" BOLD-fMRI fluctuations. However, the link of these spontaneous fluctuations to behavior is presently unclear. Attempts to directly investigate this link invariably lead to disruptions of the resting state. Here we took advantage of the well-established association between pupil diameter and attentional gain to address this issue by examining the correlation between the resting state BOLD and pupil fluctuations. Our results uncover a spontaneously emerging spatiotemporal pupil-BOLD correlation whereby a slow buildup of activity in default mode areas preceded both pupil dilation and wide-spread BOLD suppression in sensorimotor cortex. Control experiments excluded a role for luminance fluctuations or fixation. Comparing the pupil-correlated patterns to activation maps during visual imagery revealed a substantial overlap. Our results indicate a link between behavior, as indexed by pupil diameter, and resting state BOLD fluctuations. These pupil dilations, assumed to be related to attentional gain, were associated with spontaneously emerging antagonism between fundamental cortical networks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25463449,Y,corr,rand,,

Epub 2015 Jul 7.","Cardiovascular and hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) disturbances have been observed in individuals who are pathological gamblers (PGs). These may partly derive from chronic exposure to gambling. Response to amphetamine (AMPH) may reveal such disturbances while controlling for differential conditioned responses to gambling in PGs vs healthy controls (HCs). This study assessed heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and plasma cortisol following oral AMPH (0.4 mg/kg) in male PGs (n=12) and HCs (n=11) who underwent a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The Stop Signal Task enabled assessment of the link between physiological and behavioral dysregulation. Trait moderating effects were explored. The responses of PGs to AMPH differed from those of HCs on every index. PGs displayed persistent elevation in DBP and concomitant reduction in HR (i.e. baroreflex) compared to HCs beyond 90 min post-dose. PGs displayed deficits in cortisol compared to HCs that were partially reversed by AMPH. Impairment on the Stop Signal Task correlated positively with HR in controls, but negatively with HR in PGs, suggesting that strong initial and compensatory cardiac responses to a stimulant may each predict disinhibition. Extraversion predicted greater disinhibition in PGs. Noradrenergic disturbances may contribute to sensitized responses to stimulant challenge and disinhibition in PGs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152320,N,no brain data,,,

However, there is a dearth of studies addressing the neural basis of this association. METHODS: We recorded skin conductance in 26 individuals who were assessed with Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and performed a stop signal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Imaging data were processed and modeled with Statistical Parametric Mapping. We used linear regressions to examine correlations between impulsivity and skin conductance response (SCR) to salient events, identify the neural substrates of arousal regulation, and examine the relationship between the regulatory mechanism and impulsivity. RESULTS: Across subjects, higher impulsivity is associated with greater SCR to stop trials. Activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) negatively correlated to and Granger caused skin conductance time course. Furthermore, higher impulsivity is associated with a lesser strength of Granger causality of vmPFC activity on skin conductance, consistent with diminished control of physiological arousal to external stimulation. When men (n = 14) and women (n = 12) were examined separately, however, there was evidence suggesting association between impulsivity and vmPFC regulation of arousal only in women. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings confirmed the link between Barratt impulsivity and heightened arousal to salient stimuli in both genders and suggested the neural bases of altered regulation of arousal in impulsive women. More research is needed to explore the neural processes of arousal regulation in impulsive individuals and in clinical conditions that implicate poor impulse control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26079873,Y,corr,rand,,

Through multiple modalities, we showed marked vascular signal fluctuations and high-level coupling among arterial pressure, cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity and brain tissue oxygenation at <0.08 Hz. These similar spectral power distributions were also observed in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals obtained from six representative regions of interest (ROIs). After applying brain global, white-matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mean signal regressions and low-pass filtering (<0.08 Hz), the spectral power of BOLD signal was reduced by 55.6% to 64.9% in all ROIs (P=0.011 to 0.001). The coherence of BOLD signal fluctuations between an ROI pair within a same brain network was reduced by 9.9% to 20.0% (P=0.004 to <0.001), but a larger reduction of 22.5% to 37.3% (P=0.032 to <0.001) for one not in a same network. Global signal regression overall had the largest impact in reducing spectral power (by 52.2% to 61.7%) and coherence, relative to the other three preprocessing steps.

Patients with psoriasis are also more likely to suffer from comorbid depression. Whether depression accelerates the development of subclinical atherosclerosis in psoriasis is unknown. METHODS: Patients were selected from within a larger psoriasis cohort. Those who reported a history of depression (N = 36) on survey were matched by age and gender to patients who reported no history of psychiatric illness (N = 36). Target-to-background ratio from FDG PET/CT was used to assess aortic vascular inflammation and coronary CT angiography scans were analyzed to determine coronary plaque burden. Multivariable linear regression was performed to understand the effect of self-reported depression on vascular inflammation and coronary plaque burden after adjustment for Framingham risk (standardized beta reported). RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, vascular inflammation and coronary plaque burden were significantly increased in patients with self-reported depression as compared to patients with psoriasis alone. After adjustment for Framingham Risk Score, vascular inflammation (beta = 0.26, p = 0.02), total plaque burden (beta = 0.17, p = 0.03), and non-calcified burden (beta = 0.17, p = 0.03) were associated with self-reported depression.

OBJECTIVE: To define the severity of abnormal eating behavior and sucrose preference and their neural correlates in patients with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and semantic dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine patients with dementia (19 with bvFTD, 15 with semantic dementia, and 15 with Alzheimer disease) were recruited, and their eating behavior was compared with that of 25 healthy controls. The study was conducted from November 1, 2013, through May 31, 2015, and data analyzed from June 1 to August 31, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients participated in an ad libitum breakfast test meal, and their total caloric intake and food preferences were measured. Changes in eating behavior were also measured using the Appetite and Eating Habits Questionnaire (APEHQ) and the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory (CBI). Sucrose preference was tested by measuring liking ratings of 3 desserts of varying sucrose content (A: 26%, B: 39%, C: 60%). Voxel-based morphometry analysis of whole-brain 3-T high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the gray matter density changes across groups and their relations to eating behaviors. RESULTS: Mean (SD) ages of patients in all 4 groups ranged from 62 (8.3) to 66 (8.4) years. At the ad libitum breakfast test meal, all patients with bvFTD had increased total caloric intake (mean, 1344 calories) compared with the Alzheimer disease (mean, 710 calories), semantic dementia (mean, 573 calories), and control groups (mean, 603 calories) (P < .001). Patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia had a strong sucrose preference compared with the other groups. Increased caloric intake correlated with atrophy in discrete neural networks that differed between patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia but included the cingulate cortices, thalami, and cerebellum in patients with bvFTD, with the addition of the orbitofrontal cortices and nucleus accumbens in patients with semantic dementia. A distributed network of neural correlates was associated with sucrose preference in patients with FTD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Marked hyperphagia is restricted to bvFTD, present in all patients with this diagnosis, and supports its diagnostic value. Differing neural networks control eating behavior in patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia and are likely responsible for the differences seen, with a similar network controlling sucrose preference. These networks share structures that control cognitive-reward, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and visual modulation of eating behavior. Delineating the neural networks involved in mediating these changes in eating behavior may enable treatment of these features in patients with complex medical needs and aid in our understanding of structures that control eating behavior in patients with FTD and healthy individuals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26810632,N,structural,,,

Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the entire lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal cord was performed using a sexual stimulation paradigm designed to elicit psychological and physical components of sexual arousal. Responses were measured in 9 healthy adult women during 3 consecutive conditions: (a) erotic audiovisual, (b) manual clitoral, and (c) audiovisual plus manual stimulation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results in healthy subjects demonstrate that this method is sensitive for mapping sexual function in the spinal cord, and identify several key regions involved in human sexual response, including the intermediolateral cell column, the dorsal commissural nucleus, and the sacral parasympathetic nucleus. Using spinal functional magnetic resonance imaging, this study identified many of the spinal cord regions involved in female sexual responses. Results from audiovisual and manual clitoral stimulation correspond with previous data regarding lumbar and sacral neurologic changes during sexual arousal. This study provides the first characterization of neural activity in the human spinal cord underlying healthy female sexual responses and sets a foundation for future studies aimed at mapping changes that result from sexual dysfunction, spinal cord trauma or disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635474,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 28.","Patterns of neural activity are systematically elicited as the brain experiences categorical stimuli and a major challenge is to understand what these patterns represent. Two influential approaches, hitherto treated as separate analyses, have targeted this problem by using model-representations of stimuli to interpret the corresponding neural activity patterns. Stimulus-model-based-encoding synthesizes neural activity patterns by first training weights to map between stimulus-model features and voxels. This allows novel model-stimuli to be mapped into voxel space, and hence the strength of the model to be assessed by comparing predicted against observed neural activity. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) assesses models by testing how well the grand structure of pattern-similarities measured between all pairs of model-stimuli aligns with the same structure computed from neural activity patterns. RSA does not require model fitting, but also does not allow synthesis of neural activity patterns, thereby limiting its applicability. We introduce a new approach, representational similarity-encoding, that builds on the strengths of RSA and robustly enables stimulus-model-based neural encoding without model fitting. The approach therefore sidesteps problems associated with overfitting that notoriously confront any approach requiring parameter estimation (and is consequently low cost computationally), and importantly enables encoding analyses to be incorporated within the wider Representational Similarity Analysis framework. We illustrate this new approach by using it to synthesize and decode fMRI patterns representing the meanings of words, and discuss its potential biological relevance to encoding in semantic memory. Our new similarity-based encoding approach unites the two previously disparate methods of encoding models and RSA, capturing the strengths of both, and enabling similarity-based synthesis of predicted fMRI patterns.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26732404,N,no phys of interest,,,

Cold is a potent stimulator of BAT, activating BAT primarily through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Older or overweight individuals have less metabolic BAT activity than the lean and young, but the role of the SNS in this decline is unknown. We aimed to determine whether this lower metabolic BAT activity in older or overweight individuals can be explained by a lower SNS response to cold. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. We included 10 young obese, 11 old lean, and 14 young lean healthy men. All subjects underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-mIBG) SPECT/CT after an overnight fast and 2 h of cold exposure. Metabolic BAT activity was expressed as volume and as SUVmax of (18)F-FDG. BAT SNS activity was expressed as volume and as the ratio between (123)I-mIBG uptake in BAT and a reference region (SQUVmax of (123)I-mIBG). RESULTS: SUVmax, BAT volume, and SQUVmax were significantly different between young and old (SUVmax, 7.9 [range, 4.2-17.3] vs. 2.9 [range, 0.0-4.0]; volume, 124.8 [range, 10.9-338.8] vs. 3.4 [range, 0.0-10.9]; and SQUVmax, 2.7 [range, 1.9-4.7] vs. 0.0 [range, 0.0-2.2], respectively) (all P < 0.01) but not between lean and obese (SUVmax, 7.9 [range, 4.2-17.3] vs. 4.0 [range, 0.0-13.5] [P = 0.69]; volume, 124.8 [range, 10.9-338.8] vs. 11.8 [range, 0.0-190.2] [P = 0.64]; and SQUVmax, 2.7 [range, 1.9-4.7] vs. 1.7 [range, 0-3.5] [P = 0.69], respectively).

A combination of peripheral and central processes has been proposed to underlie this adaptation. However, specific changes in the central autonomic network have not been described in human in more detail. We hypothesized that the anterior hippocampus known to be influenced by regular physical activity might be involved in the development of increased vagal modulation after a 6 weeks high intensity intervention in young healthy men (exercise group: n = 17, control group: n = 17). In addition to the determination of physical capacity before and after the intervention, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and simultaneous heart rate variability assessment. We detected a significant increase of the power output at the anaerobic threshold of 11.4% (p < 0.001), the maximum power output Pmax of 11.2% (p < 0.001), and VO2max adjusted for body weight of 4.7% (p < 0.001) in the exercise group (EG). Comparing baseline (T0) and post-exercise (T1) values of parasympathetic modulation of the exercise group, we observed a trend for a decrease in heart rate (p < 0.06) and a significant increase of vagal modulation as indicated by RMSSD (p < 0.026) during resting state. In the whole brain analysis, we found that the connectivity pattern of the right anterior hippocampus (aHC) was specifically altered to the ventromedial anterior cortex, the dorsal striatum and to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) in the brainstem. Moreover, we observed a highly significant negative correlation between increased RMSSD after exercise and decreased functional connectivity from the right aHC to DVC (r = -0.69, p = 0.003). This indicates that increased vagal modulation was associated with functional connectivity between aHC and the DVC. In conclusion, our findings suggest that exercise associated changes in anterior hippocampal function might be involved in increased vagal modulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27092046,N,only FC corr,,,

On-demand neuromodulation targeting the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is effective in treating the acute pain and a subgroup of patients experience a decreased frequency of CH attacks. METHODS: We monitored self-reported attack frequency, headache disability, and medication intake in 33 patients with medically refractory, chronic CH (CCH) in an open label follow-up study of the original Pathway CH-1 study. Patients were followed for at least 24 months (average 750 +/- 34 days, range 699-847) after insertion of an SPG microstimulator. Remission periods (attack-free periods exceeding one month, per the ICHD 3 (beta) definition) occurring during the 24-month study period were characterized. Attack frequency, acute effectiveness, medication usage, and questionnaire data were collected at regular clinic visits. The time point ""after remission"" was defined as the first visit after the end of the remission period. RESULTS: Thirty percent (10/33) of enrolled patients experienced at least one period of complete attack remission. All remission periods followed the start of SPG stimulation, with the first period beginning 134 +/- 86 (range 21-272) days after initiation of stimulation. On average, each patient's longest remission period lasted 149 +/- 97 (range 62-322) days. The ability to treat acute attacks before and after remission was similar (37 % +/- 25 % before, 49 % +/- 32 % after; p = 0.2188).

The results indicate distinct functional differences between midbrain and cortical areas as well as between specific regions within auditory cortex, suggesting a systematic hierarchy in terms of lateralization and the representation of sensory stimulation and perception.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27080657,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively subjected invasive steady-state blood pressure recordings from 65 mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis to spectral analysis. Modified spectral bands were visually identified by plotting spectral power against frequency. RESULTS: Modified middle-frequency and low-frequency (MF' and LF') oscillations were absent in 9% and 22% of the patients, respectively. In patients in whom spontaneous blood pressure oscillations were preserved, the MF' oscillations occurred at 0.021 Hz (median, interquartile range 0.013-0.030), whereas the LF' oscillations occurred at 0.009 Hz (median, interquartile range 0.006-0.010). The absence of LF' oscillations was associated with a higher 30-day mortality [50 vs. 18%, hazard ratio, 3.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-9.8), P=0.01]. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous blood pressure oscillations in mechanically ventilated septic patients may be suppressed to lower frequencies than previously reported for spontaneously breathing, healthy humans. Patients in whom the resultant changes in blood pressure (MF' and LF' oscillations) are abolished may have a higher risk of an adverse outcome. This may reflect suppression of the pressor area in the brainstem with subsequent sympathetic dysfunction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26544524,N,no phys of interest,,,

In this study, we hypothesized that this pattern of response would be identical during induced changes in blood pressure. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation was assessed in nine healthy volunteers and six septic patients. The healthy volunteers underwent a 4-h intravenous infusion of LPS (total dose: 2 ng kg(-1) ). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP, arterial transducer) and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv, transcranial Doppler ultrasound) were recorded continuously during thigh-cuff deflation-induced changes in MAP for the determination of a modified rate of regulation (RoR). This was performed before and after LPS infusion in healthy volunteers, and within 72 h following clinical diagnosis of sepsis in patients. In healthy volunteers, thigh-cuff deflation caused a MAP reduction of 16 (13-20) % at baseline and 18 (16-20) % after LPS, while the MAP reduction was 12 (11-13) % in patients (P<0.05 versus volunteers at baseline; P<0.01 versus volunteers after LPS). The corresponding RoR values increased from 0.46 (0.31-0.49) s(-1) at baseline to 0.58 (0.36-0.74) s(-1) after LPS (P<0.05) in healthy volunteers, whereas they were similar to values observed in patients [0.43 (0.36-0.52) s(-1) ; P = 0.91 versus baseline; P = 0.14 versus LPS]. While our findings support the concept that dynamic cerebral autoregulation is enhanced during the very early stages of sepsis, they remain inconclusive with regard to more advanced stages of disease, because thigh-cuff deflation failed to induce sufficient MAP reductions in patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26017052,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2016 Mar 8.","BACKGROUND: Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we sought to determine whether normal age or exercise training cause changes in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system function in male or female healthy volunteers. METHODS: Healthy sedentary participants underwent PET studies before and after 6 months of supervised exercise training. Presynaptic uptake by the norepinephrine transporter-1 function was measured using PET imaging of [(11)C]-meta-hydroxyephedrine, a norepinephrine analog, and expressed as a permeability-surface area product (PSnt in mL/min/mL). Postsynaptic function was measured as beta-adrenergic receptor density (beta'max in pmol/mL tissue) by imaging the beta-receptor antagonist [(11)C]-CGP12177. Myocardial blood flow (MBF in mL/min/mL tissue) was measured by imaging [(15)O]-water. RESULTS: At baseline, there was no age difference in beta'max or MBF but PSnt declined with age (1.12+/-0.11 young vs 0.87+/-0.06 old, p = .036). Before training, women had significantly greater MBF (0.87+/-0.03 vs 0.69+/-0.03, p < .0001) and PSnt (1.14+/-0.08 vs 0.75+/-0.07, p < .001) than men. Training increased VO2 max by 13% (p < .0001), but there were no training effects on beta'max, PSnt, or MBF. Greater MBF in females and a trend to increased PSnt post-training persisted. CONCLUSION: With age, presynaptic uptake as measured by PSnt declines, but there were no differences in beta'max. Endurance training significantly increased VO2 max but did not cause any changes in the measures of cardiac sympathetic nervous system function. These findings suggest that significant changes do not occur or that current PET imaging methods may be inadequate to measure small serial differences in a highly reproducible manner.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26957471,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2016 Sep 5.","Interoception is the ability to consciously perceive internal bodily states. Neuroimaging suggests that the insula (IC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) mediate interoception, while studies involving patients/animals with brain lesions suggest the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is particularly important. One reason for these contrasting conclusions may lie in the types of interoceptive task used by these different approaches. Some tasks probably require integration of current physiological state with mnemonic information (e.g., how much one last ate), and these may be especially reliant upon MTL processing. We compared one task that probably requires integration - a water load task - with one that likely does not - a heart-rate tracking task - in two individuals with selective MTL damage (and with intact IC and ACC). A group of matched healthy individuals served as controls. The main finding was that individuals with MTL damage, relative to controls, were equally and significantly impaired on both types of interoception task. This suggests that MTL structures are involved in mediating interoception even when using a task (heart rate tracking) that does not seemingly require memory and that in neuroimaging studies activates the IC and ACC. The reasons for this apparent inconsistency with neuroimaging findings and the functional role of the MTL in interoception are discussed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609126,N,no corr,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the recently developed template of 11 brainstem nuclei derived from multi-contrast structural MRI at 7 Tesla as seed regions to determine their connectivity to the rest of the brain. To achieve this, we used the increased contrast-to-noise ratio of 7-Tesla fMRI compared with 3 Tesla and time-efficient simultaneous multi-slice imaging to cover the brain with high spatial resolution (1.1-mm isotropic nominal resolution) while maintaining a short repetition time (2.5 s).

In rodent models, gene expression maps define at least three discrete longitudinal subregions, which also differ in function, and in anatomical connectivity with the rest of the brain. In humans, equivalent HPC subregions are less well defined, resulting in a lack of consensus in neuroimaging approaches that limits translational study. This study determined whether a data-driven analysis, namely independent component analysis (ICA), could reproducibly define human HPC subregions, and map their respective intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the rest of the brain. Specifically, we performed ICA of resting-state fMRI activity spatially restricted within the HPC, to determine the configuration and reproducibility of functional HPC components. Using dual regression, we then performed multivariate analysis of iFC between resulting HPC components and the whole brain, including detailed connectivity with the hypothalamus, a functionally important connection not yet characterized in human. We found hippocampal ICA resulted in highly reproducible longitudinally discrete components, with greater functional heterogeneity in the anterior HPC, consistent with animal models. Anterior hippocampal components shared iFC with the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, midline thalamus, and periventricular hypothalamus, whereas posterior hippocampal components shared iFC with the anterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and mammillary bodies. We show that spatially masked hippocampal ICA with dual regression reproducibly identifies functional subregions in the human HPC, and maps their respective brain intrinsic connectivity.

After the learning period, they were asked to retrieve each of these paths using an allocentric or egocentric frame of reference while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. We found that patients with aMCI showed a specific deficit in storing new topographical memories from an allocentric perspective and retrieving stored information to perform the egocentric task.

Previously we reported that repeated intermittent d-amphetamine administration can lead to progressively greater dopamine release, thereby providing evidence of drug-induced neurochemical sensitization. Here, we test the hypothesis that repeated exposure to d-amphetamine increases dopaminergic responses to stress; that is, produces cross-sensitization. Using positron emission tomography, we measured in 17 healthy male volunteers (mean +/- s.d. = 22.1 +/- 3.4 years) [(11)C]raclopride binding responses to a validated psychosocial stress task before and 2 weeks after a regimen of repeated d-amphetamine (3 x 0.3 mg kg(-1), by mouth; n = 8) or placebo (3 x lactose, by mouth; n = 9). Mood and physiological measurements were recorded throughout each session. Before the d-amphetamine regimen, exposure to the stress task increased behavioral and physiological indices of stress (anxiety, heart rate, cortisol, all P 0.05). Following the d-amphetamine regimen, the stress-induced cortisol responses were augmented (P < 0.04), and voxel-based analyses showed larger stress-induced decreases in [(11)C]raclopride non-displaceable binding potential across the striatum. In the placebo group, re-exposure to stress led to smaller clusters of decreased [(11)C]raclopride binding, primarily in the sensorimotor striatum (P < 0.05). Together, this study provides evidence for drug x stress cross-sensitization; moreover, random exposure to stimulants and/or stress cumulatively, while enhancing dopamine release in striatal areas, may contribute to a lowered set point for psychopathologies in which altered dopamine neurotransmission is invoked.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26905412,N,no phys of interest,,,

Gender comparisons during facial movements, according to kinematics and BOLD signal, did not reveal significant differences. Effective connectivity results of psychophysiological interaction (PPI) from the same seeds located in bilateral facial premotor regions showed significant task and gender differences (p < 0.001).

The possible relationship between subclinical arterial inflammation assessed by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and arterial stiffness was investigated in patients with early type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 44), without cardiovascular disease and any type of antidiabetic medication, were studied (median age 63 years [interquartile range 54-66], men:women 27:17). Arterial inflammation was quantified as the FDG uptake maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax). SUVmax was corrected for the prescan glucose level. A target-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated by dividing the SUVmax of the arteries by the SUVmean of the caval veins (blood pool). TBRs were calculated for four individual segments (carotid arteries, ascending aorta and aortic arch, descending and abdominal aorta, and iliac and femoral arteries) and averaged for the total aortic tree (meanTBR). Arterial stiffness was assessed as central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation index (AIx).

We recently demonstrated that it could improve cerebral vasospasm (CVS) in humans after SAH. However, successful therapies for DCI must also restore cerebral blood flow (CBF) and/or autoregulatory capacity. In this study, we tested the effects of sildenafil on CBF in SAH patients at-risk for DCI. METHODS: Six subjects with angiographically confirmed CVS received 30-mg of intravenous sildenafil (mean 9 +/- 2 days after aneurysmal SAH). Each underwent (15)O-PET imaging to measure global and regional CBF at baseline and post-sildenafil. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure declined by 10 mm Hg on average post-sildenafil (8 %, p = 0.01), while ICP was unchanged. There was no change in global CBF (mean 34.5 +/- 7 ml/100g/min at baseline vs. 33.9 +/- 8.0 ml/100g/min post-sildenafil, p = 0.84). The proportion of brain regions with low CBF (<25 ml/100g/min) was also unchanged after sildenafil infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of sildenafil does not lead to a change in global or regional perfusion despite a significant reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure. While this could reflect the ineffectiveness of sildenafil-induced proximal vasodilatation to alter brain perfusion, it also suggests that cerebral autoregulatory function was preserved in this group. Future studies should assess whether sildenafil can restore or enhance autoregulation after SAH.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940913,N,no corr,,,

We sought to determine whether simvastatin increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and alters the response to induced hypertension after SAH. METHODS: Statin-naive patients admitted <72 h after WFNS >/=2 aneurysmal SAH were randomly assigned to 80 mg simvastatin/day or placebo for 21 days. Regional CBF was measured with quantitative (15)O PET on SAH day 7-10 before and after raising mean arterial pressure (MAP) 20-25 %. Autoregulatory index (AI) was calculated as the ratio of % change in resistance (MAP/CBF) to % change in MAP. Angiography was performed within 24 h of PET. Results are presented as simvastatin vs. placebo. RESULTS: Thirteen patients received simvastatin and 12 placebo. Clinical characteristics were similar. Moderate or severe angiographic vasospasm occurred in 42 vs. 45 % and delayed cerebral ischemia in 14 vs. 55 % (p = 0.074). During PET studies, MAP (110 +/- 10 vs. 111 +/- 12), global CBF (41 +/- 12 vs. 43 +/- 13), and CVR (2.95 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.81 +/- 1.0) did not differ at baseline. When MAP was raised to 135 +/- 7 mm Hg vs. 137 +/- 15, global CBF did not change. Global AI did not differ (107 +/- 59 vs. 0. 89 +/- 52 %, p = 0.68). CBF did not change in regions with low baseline flow or in regions supplied by vessels with angiographic vasospasm in either group. Six-month modified Rankin Scale scores did not differ.

In obesity, circulating concentrations of adiponectin are decreased and hypoadiponectinaemia has in some but not all studies been associated with increased risk of hypertension. Due to this inconsistency, we decided to study adiponectin from two aspects in a cross-sectional in vivo study and in an experimental in vitro study. In the cross-sectional study, 103 men with body mass index (BMI) >/= 30.0 kg/m(2) were studied; 63 had 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) >/= 130/80 mmHg (ObeseHT) and 40 had 24-hr ABP < 130/80 mmHg (ObeseNT). As controls, we studied 27 men with BMI between 20.0 and 24.9 kg/m(2) and 24-hr ABP < 130/80 mmHg (LeanNT). Serum concentrations of adiponectin and body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning were determined. In vitro, the direct vasomotor response of adiponectin was tested on subcutaneous resistance arteries from human abdominal adipose tissue. The two obese groups had lower adiponectin concentrations compared with LeanNT (p < 0.01) [median (interquartile range)]: ObeseHT 6.5 (5.1-8.3) mg/L; ObeseNT 6.6 (5.2-7.8) mg/L; and LeanNT 9.4 (6.7-12.4) mg/L, with no significant difference in adiponectin concentrations (or body composition) between ObeseHT and ObeseNT (p = 0.67). In vitro, adiponectin did not have any direct vasodilatory effect and adiponectin did not affect angiotensin II-stimulated vasoconstriction. In conclusion, obese hypertensive men have similar serum concentrations of adiponectin as obese normotensive men.

In contrast, the response to threat itself has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To explore potential disruption in fear conditioning neurocircuitry in service members with PTSD, specifically in response to predictable versus unpredictable threats. METHOD: In the current study, active-duty U.S. Army soldiers with (PTSD group; n = 38) and without PTSD (deployment-exposed controls; DEC; n = 40), participated in a fear-conditioning study in which threat predictability was manipulated by presenting an aversive unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that was either preceded by a conditioned stimulus (i.e., predictable) or UCS alone (i.e., unpredictable). Threat expectation, skin conductance response (SCR), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal to predictable and unpredictable threats (i.e., UCS) were assessed. RESULTS: Both groups showed greater threat expectancy and diminished threat-elicited SCRs to predictable compared to unpredictable threat. Significant group differences were observed within the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and superior and middle temporal gyri. Contrary to our predictions, the PTSD group showed a diminished threat-related response within each of these brain regions during predictable compared to unpredictable threat, whereas the DEC group showed increased activation. CONCLUSION: Although, the PTSD group showed greater threat-related diminution, hypersensitivity to unpredictable threat cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, pre-trauma, trait-like factors may have contributed to group differences in activation of the neurocircuitry underpinning fear conditioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27867434,N,no corr,,,

Given the high amount of information shared between brain-derived signals, we compared the results of traditional bivariate Granger causality (GC) with a globally conditioned approach which evaluated the additional influence of each brain region on the causal target while factoring out effects concomitantly mediated by other brain regions. The bivariate approach resulted in a large number of possibly spurious causal brain-brain links, while, using the globally conditioned approach, we demonstrated the existence of significant selective causal links between cortical/subcortical brain regions and sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation as well as sympathovagal balance. In particular, we demonstrated a causal role of the amygdala, hypothalamus, brainstem and, among others, medial, middle and superior frontal gyri, superior temporal pole, paracentral lobule and cerebellar regions in modulating the so-called central autonomic network (CAN).

The evolutionarily conserved hypothalamic peptide oxytocin is a key modulator of human sociality, but its effects on fear conditioning are still elusive. In the present randomized controlled study involving 97 healthy male subjects, we therefore employed functional magnetic resonance imaging and simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) measures to characterize the modulatory influence of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) on Pavlovian fear conditioning. We found that the peptide strengthened conditioning on both the behavioral and neural levels. Specifically, subjects exhibited faster task-related responses and enhanced SCRs to fear-associated stimuli in the late phase of conditioning, which was paralleled by heightened activity in cingulate cortex subregions in the absence of changes in amygdala function. This speaks against amygdalocentric views of oxytocin having pure anxiolytic-like effects. Instead, it suggests that the peptide enables extremely rapid and flexible adaptation to fear signals in social contexts, which may confer clear evolutionary advantages but could also elevate vulnerability for the pathological sequelae of interpersonal trauma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272050,N,pharma study,,,

Much work has focused on the common effects of stress, but ANS responses in different body systems are dissociable and may result from distinct patterns of cortical-subcortical interactions. Here, we used machine learning to develop multivariate patterns of fMRI activity predictive of heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL) responses during social threat in humans (N = 18). Overall, brain patterns predicted both HR and SCL in cross-validated analyses successfully (rHR = 0.54, rSCL = 0.58, both p < 0.0001). These patterns partly reflected central stress mechanisms common to both responses because each pattern predicted the other signal to some degree (rHR-->SCL = 0.21 and rSCL-->HR = 0.22, both p < 0.01), but they were largely physiological response specific. Both patterns included positive predictive weights in dorsal anterior cingulate and cerebellum and negative weights in ventromedial PFC and local pattern similarity analyses within these regions suggested that they encode common central stress mechanisms. However, the predictive maps and searchlight analysis suggested that the patterns predictive of HR and SCL were substantially different across most of the brain, including significant differences in ventromedial PFC, insula, lateral PFC, pre-SMA, and dmPFC. Overall, the results indicate that specific patterns of cerebral activity track threat-induced autonomic responses in specific body systems. Physiological measures of threat are not interchangeable, but rather reflect specific interactions among brain systems. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We show that threat-induced increases in heart rate and skin conductance share some common representations in the brain, located mainly in the vmPFC, temporal and parahippocampal cortices, thalamus, and brainstem. However, despite these similarities, the brain patterns that predict these two autonomic responses are largely distinct. This evidence for largely output-measure-specific regulation of autonomic responses argues against a common system hypothesis and provides evidence that different autonomic measures reflect distinct, measurable patterns of cortical-subcortical interactions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881783,N,mvpa,,,

Because rare, loss-of-function mutations in the DDC gene result in severe enzymatic deficiency and devastating autonomic, motor, and cognitive impairment, DDC common genetic polymorphisms have been proposed as a source of more moderate, but clinically important, alterations in DDC function that may contribute to risk, course, or treatment response in complex, heritable neuropsychiatric illnesses. However, a direct link between common genetic variation in DDC and DDC activity in the living human brain has never been established. We therefore tested for this association by conducting extensive genotyping across the DDC gene in a large cohort of 120 healthy individuals, for whom DDC activity was then quantified with [(18)F]-FDOPA positron emission tomography (PET). The specific uptake constant, Ki, a measure of DDC activity, was estimated for striatal regions of interest and found to be predicted by one of five tested haplotypes, particularly in the ventral striatum. These data provide evidence for cis-acting, functional common polymorphisms in the DDC gene and support future work to determine whether such variation might meaningfully contribute to DDC-mediated neural processes relevant to neuropsychiatric illness and treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924680,N,no phys of interest,,,

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a Food and Drug Administration approved somatic treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, the involvement of surgery has limited VNS only to patients who have failed to respond to multiple treatment options. Transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) is a relatively new, noninvasive VNS method based on the rationale that there is afferent/efferent vagus nerve distribution on the surface of the ear. The safe and low-cost characteristics of tVNS have the potential to significantly expand the clinical application of VNS. METHODS: In this study, we investigated how tVNS can modulate the default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity (FC) in mild or moderate major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Forty-nine MDD patients were recruited and received tVNS or sham tVNS (stVNS) treatments. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the study and were included in data analysis. After 1 month of tVNS treatment, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score reduced significantly in the tVNS group as compared with the stVNS group. The FC between the DMN and anterior insula and parahippocampus decreased; the FC between the DMN and precuneus and orbital prefrontal cortex increased compared with stVNS. All these FC increases are also associated with 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale reduction. CONCLUSIONS: tVNS can significantly modulate the DMN FC of MDD patients; our results provide insights to elucidate the brain mechanism of tVNS treatment for MDD patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963932,N,clinical,,,

While recording beat-to-beat blood pressure, the words ANGER or RELAX were presented subliminally just prior to rapid word/non-word reaction-time judgements of letter-strings. Subliminal ANGER primes delayed the time taken to reach rapid lexical decisions, relative to RELAX primes. However, individuals with high trait anger were speeded up by subliminal anger primes. ANGER primes increased systolic blood pressure and the magnitude of this increase predicted reaction time prolongation. Within the brain, ANGER trials evoked an enhancement of activity within dorsal pons and an attenuation of activity within visual occipitotemporal and attentional parietal cortices. Activity within periaqueductal grey matter, occipital and parietal regions increased linearly with evoked blood pressure changes, indicating neural substrates through which covert anger impairs semantic decisions, putatively through its expression as visceral arousal. The behavioural and physiological impact of anger states compromises the efficiency of cognitive processing through action-ready changes in autonomic response that skew regional neural activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26253525,Y,corr,uns,,

While this method has achieved wide appeal and clinical translation, the tolerability of CO2-related tasks amongst patients and the elderly remains a challenge in more routine and large-scale applications. In this work, we propose an improved method to quantify CVR by exploiting intrinsic fluctuations in CO2 and corresponding changes in the resting-state BOLD signal (rs-qCVR). Our rs-qCVR approach requires simultaneous monitoring of PETCO2, cardiac pulsation and respiratory volume. In 16 healthy adults, we compare our quantitative CVR estimation technique to the prospective CO2-targeting based CVR quantification approach (qCVR, the ""standard""). We also compare our rs-CVR to non-quantitative alternatives including the resting-state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and global-signal regression. When all subjects were pooled, only RSFA and ALFF were significantly associated with qCVR. However, for characterizing regional CVR variations within each subject, only the PETCO2-based rs-qCVR measure is strongly associated with standard qCVR in 100% of the subjects (p</=0.1). In contrast, for the more qualitative CVR measures, significant within-subject association with qCVR was only achieved in 50-70% of the subjects.

Although prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has identified brain regions that support Pavlovian conditioning, it remains unclear whether these regions support time-related processes important for this type of associative learning. Elucidating the neural substrates of temporal conditioning is important for a complete understanding of the Pavlovian conditioning process. Therefore, the present study used a temporal Pavlovian conditioning procedure to investigate brain activity that mediates the formation of temporal associations. During fMRI, twenty-three healthy volunteers completed a temporal conditioning procedure and a control task that does not support conditioning. Specifically, during the temporal conditioning procedure, the UCS was presented at fixed intervals (ITI: 20s) while in the control condition the UCS was presented at random intervals (Average ITI: 20s, ITI Range: 6-34s). We observed greater skin conductance responses and expectancy of the UCS during fixed (i.e., temporal conditioning) relative to random (i.e., control procedure) interval trials. These findings demonstrate fixed trials support temporal conditioning, while random trials do not. During fixed interval trials, greater conditioned fMRI signal responses were observed within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, inferior and middle temporal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala.

By contrast, the dissociative subtype of PTSD, characterized by depersonalization and derealization symptoms, is frequently accompanied by additional passive or submissive defensive responses associated with autonomic blunting. Here, the periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays a central role in defensive responses, where the dorsolateral (DL-PAG) and ventrolateral PAG (VL-PAG) are thought to mediate active and passive defensive responses, respectively. METHODS: We examined PAG subregion (dorsolateral and ventrolateral) resting-state functional connectivity in three groups: PTSD patients without the dissociative subtype (n = 60); PTSD patients with the dissociative subtype (n = 37); and healthy controls (n = 40) using a seed-based approach via PickAtlas and SPM12. RESULTS: All PTSD patients showed extensive DL- and VL-PAG functional connectivity at rest with areas associated with emotional reactivity and defensive action as compared to controls (n = 40). Although all PTSD patients demonstrated DL-PAG functional connectivity with areas associated with initiation of active coping strategies and hyperarousal (e.g., dorsal anterior cingulate; anterior insula), only dissociative PTSD patients exhibited greater VL-PAG functional connectivity with brain regions linked to passive coping strategies and increased levels of depersonalization (e.g., temporoparietal junction; rolandic operculum). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest greater defensive posturing in PTSD patients even at rest and demonstrate that those with the dissociative subtype show unique patterns of PAG functional connectivity when compared to those without the subtype.

Here, we systematically modulated cardiorespiratory sensations in humans using bolus infusions of isoproterenol, a rapidly acting peripheral beta-adrenergic agonist similar to adrenaline. To identify central neural processes underlying these parametrically modulated interoceptive states, we used pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to simultaneously measure blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) signals in healthy participants. Isoproterenol infusions induced dose-dependent increases in heart rate and cardiorespiratory interoception, with all participants endorsing increased sensations at the highest dose. These reports were accompanied by increased BOLD and ASL activation of the right insular cortex at the highest dose. Different responses across insula subregions were also observed. During anticipation, insula activation increased in more anterior regions. During stimulation, activation increased in the mid-dorsal and posterior insula on the right, but decreased in the same regions on the left. This study demonstrates the feasibility of phMRI for assessing brain activation during adrenergic interoceptive stimulation, and provides further evidence supporting a dynamic role for the insula in representing changes in cardiorespiratory states.This article is part of the themed issue 'Interoception beyond homeostasis: affect, cognition and mental health'.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28080974,N,methods paper,,,

Specific deficits in extinction recall, the retention of learned extinction, have been demonstrated. While deficient extinction recall, and the associated activation pattern of prefrontal and hippocampal regions, distinguishes individuals with PTSD from controls, research has not yet examined changes following treatment. We examined the behavioral and neural correlates of extinction recall before and after cognitive behavioral treatment of PTSD. METHODS: Fifty-eight participants (30 with PTSD, 28 trauma-exposed matched controls) underwent a 2-day behavioral fear conditioning, extinction, and recall paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The same procedures were repeated 10 weeks later, after PTSD patients had completed prolonged exposure treatment. We analyzed fMRI data from 32 subjects (16 PTSD; 16 controls) and skin conductance response (SCR) data from 33 subjects (16 PTSD; 17 controls). Neural activity during extinction recall, SCR, and PTSD symptoms were compared across groups and over time. RESULTS: PTSD patients exhibited pre- to post-treatment reduction in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activation during extinction recall, and increase in functional coherence between the rACC and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Reduced PTSD symptom severity from pre- to post-treatment was significantly associated with reduced subgenual ACC and parahippocampal activation during this task. SCR during the extinction recall phase did not significantly change with treatment in the PTSD group, but change in SCR was associated with reduction in PTSD symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exposure treatment appears to alter neural activation in PTSD patients during recall of fear extinction, and change in extinction recall (measured by SCR) is associated with symptom reduction. We discuss results in the context of neural systems involved in response to affective stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27761402,N,clinical,,,

Renewal of the fear response may occur when re-encountering the conditioned stimulus within a novel context. Findings in rodents underpin the hippocampus' role in conditioned fear renewal in novel contexts, but it has yet to be investigated in humans. Forty-six healthy men took part in a 2-day, context-dependent, cued fear conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition, extinction learning (day 1) and extinction recall in the acquisition, extinction and a novel context one day later. Conditioned evaluative, skin conductance responses (SCRs) and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses served as dependent variables. Context-dependent fear renewal was reflected in stronger conditioned SCRs. In the acquisition context, individuals with a higher renewal of conditioned SCRs showed stronger activation of the fear circuit. Hippocampal activation distinguished conditioned responding in the novel compared with the extinction context. Individuals with a stronger renewal of conditioned SCRs in the novel context showed increased effective connectivity of hippocampal activation foci with structures in the fear and extinction network. These results outline the pivotal role of the hippocampus and its connectivity in conditioned fear renewal in a novel context in humans and might have important implications for exposure therapy in anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27053767,N,clinical,,,

Physiological variables such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory variation (RV) affect the BOLD signal in a way that may interfere with the estimation and detection of true task-related neural activity. This interference is of particular concern when these variables themselves show task-related modulations. We first establish that a simple movement task reliably induces a change in HR but not RV. In group data, the effect of HR on the BOLD response was larger and more widespread throughout the brain than were the effects of RV or phase regressors. The inclusion of HR regressors, but not RV or phase regressors, had a small but reliable effect on the estimated hemodynamic response function (HRF) in M1 and the cerebellum. We next asked whether the inclusion of a nested set of physiological regressors combining phase, RV, and HR significantly improved the model fit in individual participants' data sets. There was a significant improvement from HR correction in M1 for the greatest number of participants, followed by RV and phase correction. These improvements were more modest in the cerebellum.

The OFC is densely connected with the hypothalamus, a heterogeneous structure controlling autonomic functions that can be divided into two major parts: the lateral and the medial. Resting-state functional connectivity has allowed us to parcellate the cerebral cortex into putative functional areas based on the changes in the spatial pattern of connectivity in the cerebral cortex when a seed point is moved from one voxel to another. In the present high spatial-resolution fMRI study, we investigate the connectivity-based organization of the OFC with reference to the hypothalamus. The OFC was parcellated using resting-state functional connectivity in an individual subject approach, and then the functional connectivity was examined between the parcellated areas in the OFC and the lateral/medial hypothalamus. We found a functional double dissociation in the OFC: the lateral OFC (the lateral orbital gyrus) was more likely connected with the lateral hypothalamus, whereas the medial OFC (the medial orbital and rectal gyri) was more likely connected with the medial hypothalamus. These results demonstrate the fundamental heterogeneity of the OFC, and suggest a potential neural basis of the OFC-hypothalamic functional interaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27303281,N,no phys of interest,,,

Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed that a co-activation of sensory and frontoparietal areas is crucial for conscious sensory perception in the several second time-scale of BOLD signal fluctuations. Electrophysiological recordings with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) have shown that event related responses (ERs), phase-locking of neuronal activity, and oscillation amplitude modulations in sub-second timescales are greater for consciously perceived than for unperceived stimuli. The cortical sources of ER and oscillation dynamics predicting the conscious perception have, however, remained unclear because these prior studies have utilized MEG/EEG sensor-level analyses or iEEG with limited neuroanatomical coverage. We used a somatosensory detection task, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and cortically constrained source reconstruction to identify the cortical areas where ERs, local poststimulus amplitudes and phase-locking of neuronal activity are predictive of the conscious access of somatosensory information. We show here that strengthened ERs, phase-locking to stimulus onset (SL), and induced oscillations amplitude modulations all predicted conscious somatosensory perception, but the most robust and widespread of these was SL that was sustained in low-alpha (6-10 Hz) band. The strength of SL and to a lesser extent that of ER predicted conscious perception in the somatosensory, lateral and medial frontal, posterior parietal, and in the cingulate cortex.

Epub 2016 Nov 2.","Neuroimaging studies of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) region is responsive to a wide variety of stimuli and psychological states, such as pain, cognitive control, and prediction error (PE). In contrast, a recent meta-analysis argues that the dACC is selective for pain, whereas the supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA are specifically associated with higher-level cognitive processes (Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2015). To empirically test this claim, we manipulated effects of pain, conflict, and PE in a single experiment using human subjects. We observed a robust dorsal-ventral dissociation within the mPFC with cognitive effects of PE and conflict overlapping dorsally and pain localized more ventrally. Classification of subjects based on the presence or absence of a paracingulate sulcus showed that PE effects extended across the dorsal area of the dACC and into the pre-SMA. These results begin to resolve recent controversies by showing the following: (1) the mPFC includes dissociable regions for pain and cognitive processing; and (2) meta-analyses are correct in localizing cognitive effects to the dACC, although these effects extend to the pre-SMA as well. These results both provide evidence distinguishing between different theories of mPFC function and highlight the importance of taking individual anatomical variability into account when conducting empirical studies of the mPFC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Decades of neuroimaging research have shown the mPFC to represent a wide variety of stimulus processing and cognitive states. However, recently it has been argued whether distinct regions of the mPFC separately process pain and cognitive phenomena. To address this controversy, this study directly compared pain and cognitive processes within subjects. We found a double dissociation within the mPFC with pain localized ventral to the cingulate sulcus and cognitive effects localized more dorsally within the dACC and spreading into the pre-supplementary motor area. This provides empirical evidence to help resolve the current debate about the functional architecture of the mPFC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807031,N,clinical,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An 8-week prospective intervention study of 18 healthy postmenopausal women, with a body mass index of 30-35 kg m(-2). The first 2 weeks subjects were on an isocaloric diet and 4 weeks on a 1000 kcal restricted diet followed by 2 weeks on an isocaloric diet. Anthropometric and laboratory analyses were performed weekly during the isocaloric diet and three times a week during the caloric-restricted diet. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained before and after the caloric restriction in four separate sessions (fasting or sated). Generalized Estimating Equations analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: A mean weight loss of 4.2+/-0.5 kg (4.8%) and a 4.2+/-0.4 cm decline in waist circumference were achieved. In the first week of caloric restriction, triglyceride, leptin, resistin and adiponectin levels as well as systolic blood pressure decreased and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 levels increased. During and after weight loss, a significant increase in ghrelin levels was observed. Before weight loss, increased activation of the right amygdala was seen in response to food stimuli, and free fatty acids and glucose correlated with activity in various areas involved in food reward processing. After weight loss, fasting ghrelin and sated leptin levels correlated with activity in these areas. CONCLUSIONS: Already in the first week of caloric restriction in obese postmenopausal women, various favourable metabolic changes occur before clinically relevant weight loss is achieved. Activity in the amygdala region and correlations of metabolic factors with activity in brain areas involved in food reward processing differ substantially before and after weight loss.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216819,N,no corr,,,

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) encompasses visceral control regions that are components of intrinsic networks of the brain, particularly the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN). Might individual differences in resting HF-HRV covary with resting state neural activity in the DMN and SN, particularly within the mPFC? This question was addressed using fMRI data from an eyes-open, 5-min rest period during which echoplanar brain imaging yielded BOLD time series. Independent component analysis yielded functional connectivity estimates defining the DMN and SN. HF-HRV was measured in a rest period outside of the scanner. Midlife (52% female) adults were assessed in two studies (Study 1, N = 107; Study 2, N = 112). Neither overall DMN nor SN connectivity strength was related to HF-HRV. However, HF-HRV related to connectivity of one region within mPFC shared by the DMN and SN, namely, the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, an area with connectivity to other regions involved in autonomic control. In sum, HF-HRV does not seem directly related to global resting state activity of intrinsic brain networks, but rather to more localized connectivity. A mPFC region was of particular interest as connectivity related to HF-HRV was shared by the DMN and SN.

We previously found that the cerebral vasomotor and metabolic responses to levodopa are dissociated in PD subjects. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether levodopa-mediated dissociation is exaggerated in LID or distinguishes LID from non-LID subjects. To explore this possibility, we used dual-tracer positron emission tomography to quantify regional cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity in 28 PD subjects (14 LID, 14 non-LID), scanned before and during intravenous levodopa infusion. Levodopa-mediated dissociation was most prominent in the posterior putamen (P < 0.0001) and greater in LID than in non-LID and test-retest subjects. Strikingly, LID subjects also showed increased sensorimotor cortex (SMC) activity in the baseline, unmedicated state. Imaging data from an independent PD sample (106 subjects) linked these differences to loss of mesocortical dopamine terminals in advanced patients. In aggregate, the data suggest that LID results from an overactive vasomotor response to levodopa in the putamen on a background of disease-related increases in SMC activity.

Fifty-one participants (29 women) were injected with 0.6ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline to induce a peripheral inflammatory response. The subjects were then tested with a pressure pain fMRI paradigm designed to capture descending pain inhibitory activity 2h after injection, and blood was sampled for cytokine analysis. The subjects injected with LPS became more pain sensitive compared to the placebo group, and the heightened pain sensitivity was paralleled by decreased activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) compared to placebo; areas involved in descending pain regulation. The LPS group also had higher activity in the anterior insular cortex, an area underpinning affective and interoceptive pain processing. Women displayed overall less pain-evoked rACC activity compared to men, which may have rendered women less resilient to immune provocation, possibly explaining sex differences in LPS-induced pain sensitivity.

We succeeded in identifying HRDP in nine of our runners, whereas the remaining three runners showed entirely linear HR response. In those nine runners, no significant difference was found between HR and RS at HRDP and those at LT. Significant correlation was found between HR at HRDP and HR at LT (r = 0.84, p = 0.005), but RS at HRDP was not significantly correlated with RS at LT (r = 0.63, p = 0.07). All nine runners were able to complete the PET with steady state conditions being achieved for both BLa and HR. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the modified CT has a potential to be used as an alternative method for assessment of LT in distance runners presenting a HRDP.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28639860,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2016 Mar 24.","Fear extinction is a central model for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Initial research has reported that the single presentation of a conditioned stimulus prior to extinction learning can permanently block the return of fear. However, only few studies have explored this issue and could not always replicate the findings. The present study examined human fear extinction using a four-day design. On the first day, two neutral stimuli were paired with electrical stimulation (UCS), while a third stimulus (CS-) was not. Twenty-four hours later, one conditioned stimulus (CS+rem) and the CS- were reminded once, 10 min before extinction learning, while the other conditioned stimulus (CS+non-rem) was not presented prior to extinction learning. All stimuli were presented during extinction learning and during two re-extinction sessions (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) without reinforcement. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses and skin conductance responses (SCRs) to both CS+ and the CS- were explored during acquisition, extinction, and in both re-extinction sessions. Regarding SCRs, the results showed that a single presentation of a conditioned stimulus did not block the return of fear during re-extinction: Fear recovery during re-extinction (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) was observed for both CS+ compared with the CS- with no difference between CS+rem and CS+non-rem. Regarding BOLD-responses, no significant differences between CS+rem and CS+non-rem were found in region of interest (ROI)-analyses (amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) during extinction learning and both re-extinction sessions. Whole-brain analyses showed increased BOLD-responses to the CS+non-rem as compared to the CS+rem in several regions (e.g., middle frontal gyrus) during extinction learning and re-extinction (24 h after extinction learning). The present findings suggest that the effect of preventing the return of fear by disrupting reconsolidation seems to be a more labile phenomenon than previously assumed. Possible boundary conditions and implications are discussed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27111105,N,no corr,,,

It is an established paradigm for measuring autonomic sensitization in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Successful use of this procedure during fMRI requires elicitation of brain responses that have sufficient signal-noise ratios when recorded in a supine, rather than sitting, position. We investigated the modulating effects of posture and stimulus spectral composition on peripheral psychophysiological responses to loud sounds. Healthy subjects (N = 24) weekly engaged in a loud-tone-like procedure that presented 500 msec, 95 dB sound pressure level, pure-tone or white-noise stimuli, either while sitting or supine and while peripheral physiological responses were recorded. Heart rate, skin conductance, and eye blink electromyographic responses were larger to white-noise than pure-tone stimuli (p's < 0.001, generalized eta squared 0.073-0.076). Psychophysiological responses to the stimuli were similar in the sitting and supine position (p's >/= 0.082). Presenting white noise, rather than pure-tone, stimuli may improve the detection sensitivity of the neural concomitants of heightened autonomic responses by generating larger responses. Recording in the supine position appears to have little or no impact on psychophysiological response magnitudes to the auditory stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27583659,N,no brain data,,,

Our aim was to evaluate both elimination of NTproBNP through dialysate and a possible relationship between plasma and/or dialysate NTproBNP level and membrane transport status of peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS: 57 plasma (P) and dialysate (D) samples of 44 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients were analyzed for NTproBNP. Modified peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results and other variables were obtained from the charts. RESULTS: Median (IQR) NTproBNP concentrations (pg/mL x 1,000) in P and D were 3.3 (1 - 13) and 0.5 (0.2 - 3.6), respectively. There was a linear correlation between P-NTproBNP and D-NTproBNP (r = 0.928, p = 0.0001; regression equation was y = 0.897*x -0.28). Mean P/D-NTproBNP ratio was 5.5 +/- 0.5. Median P and D-NTproBNP levels by the membrane transport status were aligned as high (H) > high average (HA) > low average (LA), and the difference between H and LA was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), residual Kt/V and dialysate/plasma ratio of crearinine (D/P Cr) were significant predictors of D-NTproBNP; whereas only MAP and residual Kt/V were significant predictors of P-NTproBNP in multiple regression analysis. Both P- and D-NTproBNP have significant and similar size of correlations with MAP, albumin, D/P Cr ratio, and Na. CONCLUSIONS: D-NTproBNP level is ~ 1/5 of P-NTproBNP, and the issue of relationship between membrane transport status and natriuretic peptide levels needs more work.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27007867,N,no phys of interest,,,

Studies investigating the neural correlates of aversive differential delay conditioning in BPD are currently lacking. We aimed to investigate acquisition, within-session extinction, between-session extinction recall, and reacquisition. We expected increased activation in the insula, amygdala, and anterior cingulate, and decreased prefrontal activation in BPD patients. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 27 medication-free female BPD patients and 26 female healthy controls (HC) performed a differential delay aversive conditioning paradigm. An electric shock served as unconditioned stimulus, two neutral pictures as conditioned stimuli (CS+/CS-). Dependent variables were blood-oxygen-level-dependent response, skin conductance response (SCR), and subjective ratings (valence, arousal). No significant between-group differences in brain activation were found [all p(FDR) > 0.05]. Within-group comparisons for CS+unpaired > CS- revealed increased insula activity in BPD patients but not in HC during early acquisition; during late acquisition, both groups recruited fronto-parietal areas [p(FDR) < 0.05]. During extinction, BPD patients rated both CS+ and CS- as significantly more arousing and aversive than HC and activated the amygdala in response to CS+. In contrast, HC showed increased prefrontal activity in response to CS+ > CS during extinction. During extinction recall, there was a trend for stronger SCR to CS+ > CS in BPD patients. Amygdala habituation to CS+paired (CS+ in temporal contingency with the aversive event) during acquisition was found in HC but not in patients. Our findings suggest altered temporal response patterns in terms of increased vigilance already during early acquisition and delayed extinction processes in individuals with BPD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25814470,N,no phys of interest,,,

The right anterior insula is assumed to mediate this ability. The role of the posterior insula, particularly posterior-to-anterior insula signal flows is less clear in this respect. We scanned 27 healthy people with either high or low interoceptive awareness using 3T fMRI, while they either monitored their own heartbeats, or external tones, respectively. We used a combination of network centrality and bivariate connectivity analyses to characterize changes in cortical signal flows between the posterior insula and the anterior insula during interoceptive awareness or exteroceptive awareness, respectively. We show that heartbeat monitoring was accompanied by reduced network centrality of the right posterior insula, and decreased functional connectivity strengths between the right posterior insula and the right mid and anterior insula. In addition, decreased signal flows between the right posterior insula and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, and the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices were observed during interoceptive awareness. Functional connectivity changes were only shown by people with high interoceptive awareness, and occurred specifically within the low-frequency range (i.e., <0.1 Hz). Both groups did not differ in their functional connectivity profiles during rest. Our results show for the first time that interoceptive awareness changes intra-insula signal flows in the low-frequency range. We speculate that the selective inhibition of slow signal progression along the posterior-to-anterior insula pathway during interoceptive awareness allows the salient and noiseless detection of one's own heartbeat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25613901,N,no corr,,,
Effect of Task-Correlated Physiological Fluctuations and Motion in 2D and 3D Echo-Planar Imaging in a Higher Cognitive Level fMRI Paradigm,Front Neurosci,"Ladstein, Jarle,Evensmoen, Hallvard R,Haberg, Asta K,Kristoffersen, Anders,Goa, Pal E,eng,Switzerland,Front Neurosci. 2016 Jun 7;10:225. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2016.00225. eCollection 2016.","PURPOSE: To compare 2D and 3D echo-planar imaging (EPI) in a higher cognitive level fMRI paradigm. In particular, to study the link between the presence of task-correlated physiological fluctuations and motion and the fMRI contrast estimates from either 2D EPI or 3D EPI datasets, with and without adding nuisance regressors to the model. A signal model in the presence of partly task-correlated fluctuations is derived, and predictions for contrast estimates with and without nuisance regressors are made. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one healthy volunteers were scanned using 2D EPI and 3D EPI during a virtual environmental learning paradigm. In a subgroup of 7 subjects, heart rate and respiration were logged, and the correlation with the paradigm was evaluated. FMRI analysis was performed using models with and without nuisance regressors. Differences in the mean contrast estimates were investigated by analysis-of-variance using Subject, Sequence, Day, and Run as factors. The distributions of group level contrast estimates were compared. RESULTS: Partially task-correlated fluctuations in respiration, heart rate and motion were observed. Statistically significant differences were found in the mean contrast estimates between the 2D EPI and 3D EPI when using a model without nuisance regressors. The inclusion of nuisance regressors for cardiorespiratory effects and motion reduced the difference to a statistically non-significant level. Furthermore, the contrast estimate values shifted more when including nuisance regressors for 3D EPI compared to 2D EPI. CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with 3D EPI having a higher sensitivity to fluctuations compared to 2D EPI. In the presence partially task-correlated physiological fluctuations or motion, proper correction is necessary to get expectation correct contrast estimates when using 3D EPI. As such task-correlated physiological fluctuations or motion is difficult to avoid in paradigms exploring higher cognitive functions, 2D EPI seems to be the preferred choice for higher cognitive level fMRI paradigms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375405,N,methods paper,,,

Epub 2016 Mar 25.","BACKGROUND: The authors herein describe a novel method of repeatable hepatic isolation using an implantable access system allowing simultaneous control of hepatic arterial and portal flows by multiple endovascular catheters. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of the system and to compress standard intravenous chemotherapy into 4 weeks of targeted intra-arterial delivery. METHODS: An arterial access system was implanted to the axillary artery via an anastomosis. Infusions of oxaliplatin were performed biweekly for 4 weeks, using balloon catheters to achieve hepatic isolation and segmental selectivity for 20-25 min. Fifty-seven treatments under general anesthetic were performed in ten patients with inoperable chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Systemic, intrahepatic, and hepatic venous pressures were recorded to assess vascular isolation, and platinum levels were measured to assess chemotherapy distribution. RESULTS: Pressure verified, multiple day-only hepatic vascular isolation infusions were achieved in nine of ten patients, with a single patient receiving multiple hepatic arterial infusions. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging confirmed partial response in three of ten patients and stable disease in three of ten patients. Systemic toxicity was minimal as all treatment-related gastrointestinal and neuropathic symptoms reported throughout the 4 weeks were grades 1-2. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial chemotherapy infusions with hepatic vascular isolation can be achieved repeatedly with targeted selectivity and minimal complications using an implantable multicatheter access system. Oxaliplatin infusions over a 4-week period may achieve tumor response in selected patients in the salvage setting. The technique should be further assessed in a phase Ib/II study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27016294,N,no brain data,,,

Evoked haemodynamic responses for basic Stroop/negative priming activations were compared. For basic Stroop to neutral contrast, patients with DPRD differed in the location (inferior vs. superior lobule) of the parietal region involved, but showed similar activations in the left frontal region. In addition, patients with DPRD also co-activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (BA9) and posterior cingulate cortex (BA31), which were also found to be the main between-group difference regions. These regions furthermore showed connectivity with frequency of depersonalization states. Evoked haemodynamic responses drawn from regions of interest indicated significant between-group differences in 30-40% of time points. Brain-behaviour correlations differed mainly in laterality, yet only slightly in regions. A reversal of autonomic patterning became evident in patients with DPRD for cognitive load spans, indicating less effective arousal suppression under cognitive stress - patients with DPRD showed positive associations of cognitive load with autonomic responses, whereas controls exhibit respective inverse association. Overall, the results of the present study show only minor executive cognitive peculiarities, but further support the notion of abnormalities in autonomic functioning in patients with DPRD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26791018,Y,corr,uns,,

For a better understanding of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of KOS treatment, we conducted a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 10 acute migraine patients and 10 normal control subjects during KOS treatment in a 3 T clinical MRI scanner. The fMRI data were first processed using a group independent component analysis (ICA) method and then further analyzed with a voxel-wise 3-way ANOVA modeling and region of interest (ROI) of functional connectivity metrics. All migraine participants were relieved from their acute migraine symptoms after 10-20 min KOS treatment and remained migraine free for 3-6 months. The resting-state fMRI result indicates that migraine patients have altered intrinsic functional activity in the anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus and middle/superior temporal gyrus. KOS treatment gave rise to up-regulated intrinsic functional activity for migraine patients in a number of brain regions involving the limbic and primary sensory systems, while down regulating temporally the activity for normal controls in a few brain areas, such as the right dorsal posterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus. The result of this study confirms the efficacy of KOS treatment for relieving acute migraine symptoms and reducing attack frequency. Resting-state fMRI measurements demonstrate that migraine is associated with aberrant intrinsic functional activity in the limbic and primary sensory systems. KOS in the nasal cavity gives rise to the adjustment of the intrinsic functional activity in the limbic and primary sensory networks and restores the physiological homeostasis in the autonomic nervous system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27622142,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2015 Dec 4.","OBJECT Case selection for the surgical treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the eloquent motor area remains challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for worsened muscle strength after surgery in patients with this disorder. METHODS At their hospital the authors retrospectively studied 48 consecutive patients with AVMs involving motor cortex and/or the descending pathway. All patients had undergone preoperative functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), followed by resection. Both functional and angioarchitectural factors were analyzed with respect to the change in muscle strength. Functional factors included lesion-to-corticospinal tract distance (LCD) on DTI and lesion-to-activation area distance (LAD) and cortical reorganization on fMRI. Based on preoperative muscle strength, the changes in muscle strength at 1 week and 6 months after surgery were defined as short-term and long-term surgical outcomes, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package SPSS (version 20.0.0, IBM Corp.). RESULTS Twenty-one patients (43.8%) had worsened muscle strength 1 week after surgery. However, only 10 patients (20.8%) suffered from muscle strength worsening 6 months after surgery. The LCD was significantly correlated with short-term (p < 0.001) and long-term (p < 0.001) surgical outcomes. For long-term outcomes, patients in the 5 mm >/= LCD > 0 mm (p = 0.009) and LCD > 5 mm (p < 0.001) categories were significantly associated with a lower risk of permanent motor worsening in comparison with patients in the LCD = 0 mm group. No significant difference was found between patients in the 5 mm >/= LCD > 0 mm group and LCD > 5 mm group (p = 0.116). Nidus size was the other significant predictor of short-term (p = 0.021) and long-term (p = 0.016) outcomes. For long-term outcomes, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.728, and the cutoff point was 3.6 cm. Spetzler-Martin grade was not associated with short-term surgical outcomes (0.143), although it was correlated with long-term outcomes (0.038). CONCLUSIONS An AVM with a nidus in contact with tracked eloquent fibers (LCD = 0) and having a large size is more likely to be associated with worsened muscle strength after surgery in patients with eloquent motor area AVMs. Surgical treatment in these patients should be carefully considered. In patients with an LCD > 5 mm, radical resection may be considered to eliminate the risk of hemorrhage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26636384,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, the neural mechanism underlying tVNS treatment of depression has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated how tVNS can modulate the amygdala-lateral prefrontal network resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in mild or moderate major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. METHODS: Forty-nine MDD patients were recruited and received tVNS or sham tVNS (stVNS) treatments for four weeks. Resting state fMRI scans were applied before and after treatments. RESULTS: After 1 month of tVNS treatment, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores were reduced significantly in the tVNS group as compared with the sham tVNS group. The rsFC in the tVNS group between the right amygdala and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was increased compared with sham tVNS. All the rsFC increases were also associated with HAMD reduction as well as reductions in the anxiety and retardation HAMD subscales.

Using event-related fMRI while concurrently recording skin conductance, we investigated the neurobiological processes underlying the suppression of aversive memories before and after overnight consolidation. Here we report that consolidated aversive memories retain their emotional reactivity and become more resistant to suppression. Suppression of consolidated memories involves higher prefrontal engagement, and less concomitant hippocampal and amygdala disengagement. In parallel, we show a shift away from hippocampal-dependent representational patterns to distributed neocortical representational patterns in the suppression of aversive memories after consolidation.

One key autonomic brain region is the insular cortex, which typically consists of five main gyri in each hemisphere, and shows a topographical organization of autonomic function across those gyri.

We studied brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to a series of four 18-s Valsalva maneuvers in 22 healthy females (age +/- SD: 50.0 +/- 7.9 years) and 36 healthy males (45.3 +/- 9.2 years). Comparisons of heart rate (HR) and fMRI signals were performed with repeated measures ANOVA (threshold P < 0.05 for all findings). All subjects achieved the target 30 mmHg expiratory pressure for all challenges. Typical HR responses were elicited by the maneuver, including HR increases from ~4 s into the strain period (Phase II) and rapid declines to below baseline 5-10 s, following strain release (Phase IV). Small, but significant, sex differences in HR percent change occurred during the sympathetic-dominant Phase II (female < male) and parasympathetic-dominant Phase IV (female > male, i.e., greater undershoot in males). The insular cortices showed similar patterns in all gyri, with greater signal decreases in males than females. Both sexes exhibited an anterior-posterior topographical organization of insular responses during Phase II, with anterior gyri showing higher responses than more posterior gyri. The exception was the right anterior-most gyrus in females, which had lower responses than the four other right gyri. Responses were lateralized, with right-sided dominance during Phase II in both sexes, except the right anterior-most gyrus in females, which showed lower responses than the left. The findings confirm the anterior and right-sided sympathetic dominance of the insula. Although sex differences were prominent in response magnitude, organization differences between males and females were limited to the right anterior-most gyrus, which showed a lower fMRI response in females vs. males (and vs. other gyri in females). The sex differences suggest a possible differing baseline state of brain physiology or tonic functional activity between females and males, especially in the right anterior-most gyrus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375549,N,no corr,,,

The approach allows temporal patterns to be examined without an a priori model of expected timing or pattern of response. The approach was originally applied to signals recorded from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) volumes-of-interest (VOI) during a physiologic challenge, but we have used the same technique to analyze continuous recordings of other physiological signals such as heart rate, breathing rate, and pulse oximetry. For fMRI, the method serves as a complement to whole-brain voxel-based analyses, and is useful for detecting complex responses within pre-determined brain regions, or as a post-hoc analysis of regions of interest identified by whole-brain assessments. We illustrate an implementation of the technique in the statistical software packages R and SAS. VOI timetrends are extracted from conventionally preprocessed fMRI images. A timetrend of average signal intensity across the VOI during the scanning period is calculated for each subject. The values are scaled relative to baseline periods, and time points are binned. In SAS, the procedure PROC MIXED implements the RMANOVA in a single step. In R, we present one option for implementing RMANOVA with the mixed model function ""lme"". Model diagnostics, and predicted means and differences are best performed with additional libraries and commands in R; we present one example. The ensuing results allow determination of significant overall effects, and time-point specific within- and between-group responses relative to baseline. We illustrate the technique using fMRI data from two groups of subjects who underwent a respiratory challenge. RMANOVA allows insight into the timing of responses and response differences between groups, and so is suited to physiologic testing paradigms eliciting complex response patterns.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27610219,N,methods paper,,,

This nonoxidative consumption of carbohydrate has been hypothesized to include increased de novo synthesis of amino acid neurotransmitters, especially glutamate and GABA. Here, we conducted a series of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies in human volunteers before and after vigorous exercise (>/=80% of predicted maximal heart rate). Results showed that the resonance signals of both glutamate and GABA increased significantly in the visual cortex following exercise. We further demonstrated a similar increase in glutamate following exercise in an executive region, the anterior cingulate cortex. The increase in glutamate was similar when using echo times of 30 and 144 ms, indicating that exercise-related T2 relaxation effects across this range of relaxation times did not account for the findings. In addition, we found preliminary evidence that more physical activity during the preceding week predicts higher resting glutamate levels. Overall, the results are consistent with an exercise-induced expansion of the cortical pools of glutamate and GABA, and add to a growing understanding of the distinctive brain state associated with physical activity. A more complete understanding of this brain state may reveal important insights into mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical exercise in neuropsychiatric disorders, neurorehabilitation, aging, and cognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26911692,N,no phys of interest,,,
Alterations in Amygdala-Prefrontal Functional Connectivity Account for Excessive Worry and Autonomic Dysregulation in Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Biol Psychiatry,"Makovac, Elena,Meeten, Frances,Watson, David R,Herman, Aleksandra,Garfinkel, Sarah N,D Critchley, Hugo,Ottaviani, Cristina,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Biol Psychiatry. 2016 Nov 15;80(10):786-795. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.013. Epub 2015 Oct 28.","BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by the core symptom of uncontrollable worry. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies link this symptom to aberrant functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Patients with GAD also display a characteristic pattern of autonomic dysregulation. Although frontolimbic circuitry is implicated in the regulation of autonomic arousal, no previous study to our knowledge combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with peripheral physiologic monitoring in these patients to test the hypothesis that core symptoms of worry and autonomic dysregulation in GAD arise from a shared underlying neural mechanism. METHODS: We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and the measurement of parasympathetic autonomic function (heart rate variability) in 19 patients with GAD and 21 control subjects to define neural correlates of autonomic and cognitive responses before and after induction of perseverative cognition. Seed-based analyses were conducted to quantify brain changes in functional connectivity with the right and left amygdala. RESULTS: Before induction, patients showed relatively lower connectivity between the right amygdala and right superior frontal gyrus, right paracingulate/anterior cingulate cortex, and right supramarginal gyrus than control subjects. After induction, such connectivity patterns increased in patients with GAD and decreased in control subjects, and these changes tracked increases in state perseverative cognition. Moreover, decreases in functional connectivity between the left amygdala and subgenual cingulate cortex and between the right amygdala and caudate nucleus predicted the magnitude of reduction in heart rate variability after induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results link functional brain mechanisms underlying worry and rumination to autonomic dyscontrol, highlighting overlapping neural substrates associated with cognitive and autonomic responses to the induction of perseverative cognitions in patients with GAD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26682467,M,across both groups,,,

We hypothesized that an individual's capacity for emotion regulation predicts longer-term changes in amygdala functional connectivity, supporting the modification of GAD core symptoms. Sixteen patients with GAD (14 women) and individually matched controls were studied at two time points separated by 1 year. Resting-state fMRI data and concurrent measurement of vagally mediated heart rate variability were obtained before and after the induction of perseverative cognition. A greater rise in levels of worry following the induction predicted a stronger reduction in connectivity between right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and enhanced coupling between left amygdala and ventral tegmental area at follow-up. Similarly, amplified physiological responses to the induction predicted increased connectivity between right amygdala and thalamus. Longitudinal shifts in a distinct set of functional connectivity scores were associated with concomitant changes in GAD symptomatology over the course of the year. Results highlight the prognostic value of indices of emotional dysregulation and emphasize the integral role of the amygdala as a critical hub in functional neural circuitry underlying the progression of GAD symptomatology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27369066,N,no phys of interest,,,

Therefore, we investigated the underlying neural activation occurring when we encounter someone acting in angry or joyful situation. We hypothesized a dynamic interplay between the right insula, both involved in mapping visceral states associated with emotional experiences and autonomic control, and the bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG), part of the ""social brain"", when facing angry vs. joyful situations. Twenty participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning session while watching video clips of actors grasping objects in joyful and angry situations. The analyses of functional connectivity, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM), all revealed changes in functional connectivity associated with the angry situation. Indeed, the DCM model showed that the modulatory effect of anger increased the ipsilateral forward connection from the right insula to the right STG, while it suppressed the contralateral one. Our findings reveal a critical role played by the right insula when we are engaged in angry situations. In addition, they suggest that facing angry people modulates the effective connectivity between these two nodes associated, respectively, with autonomic responses and bodily movements and human-agent motion recognition.

Goal Directed Worry Rules Are Associated with Distinct Patterns of Amygdala Functional Connectivity and Vagal Modulation during Perseverative Cognition,Front Hum Neurosci,"Meeten, Frances,Davey, Graham C L,Makovac, Elena,Watson, David R,Garfinkel, Sarah N,Critchley, Hugo D,Ottaviani, Cristina,eng,Switzerland,Front Hum Neurosci. 2016 Nov 2;10:553. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2016.00553. eCollection 2016.","Excessive and uncontrollable worry is a defining feature of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). An important endeavor in the treatment of pathological worry is to understand why some people are unable to stop worrying once they have started. Worry perseveration is associated with a tendency to deploy goal-directed worry rules (known as ""as many as can"" worry rules; AMA). These require attention to the goal of the worry task and continuation of worry until the aims of the ""worry bout"" are achieved. This study examined the association between the tendency to use AMA worry rules and neural and autonomic responses to a perseverative cognition induction. To differentiate processes underlying the AMA worry rule use from trait worry, we also examined the relationship between scores on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and neural and autonomic responses following the same induction. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) while measuring emotional bodily arousal from heart rate variability (where decreased HRV indicates stress-related parasympathetic withdrawal) in 19 patients with GAD and 21 control participants. Seed-based analyses were conducted to quantify brain changes in functional connectivity (FC) with the amygdala. The tendency to adopt an AMA worry rule was associated with validated measures of worry, anxiety, depression and rumination. AMA worry rule endorsement predicted a stronger decrease in HRV and was positively associated with increased connectivity between right amygdala and locus coeruleus (LC), a brainstem noradrenergic projection nucleus. Higher AMA scores were also associated with increased connectivity between amygdala and rostral superior frontal gyrus. Higher PSWQ scores amplified decreases in FC between right amygdala and subcallosal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and areas of parietal cortex. Our results identify neural mechanisms underlying the deployment of AMA worry rules. We propose that the relationship between AMA worry rules and increased connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents attempts by high worriers to maintain arousal and distress levels in order to feel prepared for future threats. Furthermore, we suggest that neural mechanisms associated with the PSWQ represent effortful inhibitory control during worry. These findings provide unique information about the neurobiological processes that underpin worry perseveration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27853428,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

METHODS: Patients with a history of endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain were randomized to either psychotherapy with somatosensory stimulation (ie, different techniques of acupuncture point stimulation) or wait-list control for 3 months, after which all patients were treated. The primary outcome was brain connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Prespecified secondary outcomes included pain on 11-point numeric rating scales (maximal and average global pain, pelvic pain, dyschezia, and dyspareunia) and physical and mental quality of life. A sample size of 30 per group was planned to compare outcomes in the treatment group and the wait-list control group. RESULTS: From March 2010 through March 2012, 67 women (mean age 35.6 years) were randomly allocated to intervention (n=35) or wait-list control (n=32). In comparison with wait-list controls, treated patients showed improvements after 3 months in maximal global pain (mean group difference -2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.4 to -0.8; P=.002), average global pain (-2.5, 95% CI -3.5 to -1.4; P<.001), pelvic pain (-1.4, 95% CI -2.7 to -0.1; P=.036), dyschezia (-3.5, 95% CI -5.8 to -1.3; P=.003), physical quality of life (3.8, 95% CI 0.5-7.1, P=.026), and mental quality of life (5.9, 95% CI 0.6-11.3; P=.031); dyspareunia improved nonsignificantly (-1.8, 95% CI -4.4 to 0.7; P=.150). Improvements in the intervention group remained stable at 6 and 24 months, and control patients showed comparable symptom relief after delayed intervention. CONCLUSION: Psychotherapy with somatosensory stimulation reduced global pain, pelvic pain, and dyschezia and improved quality of life in patients with endometriosis.

However, the vast majority of the sentence stimuli in previous reports have been of a social or social-emotional nature suggesting that sentence processing may be confounded with semantic content. To evaluate this possibility we had subjects read word lists that differed in phrase/constituent size (single words, 3-word phrases, 6-word sentences) and semantic content (social-emotional, social, and inanimate objects) while scanned in a 7T environment. This allowed us to investigate if the aSTG/STS responded to increasing constituent structure (with increased activity as a function of constituent size) with or without regard to a specific domain of concepts, i.e., social and/or social-emotional content. Activity in the left aSTG/STS was found to increase with constituent size. This region was also modulated by content, however, such that social-emotional concepts were preferred over social and object stimuli. Reading also induced content type effects in domain-specific semantic regions. Those preferring social-emotional content included aSTG/STS, inferior frontal gyrus, posterior STS, lateral fusiform, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, regions included in the ""social brain"", while those preferring object content included parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, and caudate, regions involved in object processing.

In this study, human participants underwent Pavlovian conditioning and extinction before we manipulated nocturnal memory consolidation by a split-night protocol with 80 healthy male participants in four groups. Recall after a second (recovery) night of sleep revealed that sleeping the first half of the night, which is dominated by slow-wave sleep, did not improve recall. Conversely, sleeping the second half of the night, which is dominated by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, led to better discrimination between fear-relevant and neutral stimuli in behavioral and autonomic measures. Meanwhile, staying awake in the second half of the night led to an increase of discrimination between extinguished and neutral stimuli, which was paralleled by an activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. We conclude that sleep, especially REM sleep, is causal to successful consolidation of dangerous and safety stimuli and reduces return of fear after extinction. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We use a split-night protocol to investigate the influence of different sleep phases on successful consolidation of conditioned fear and extinction. Such a protocol uses the fact that in humans the first half of the night is dominated by slow-wave sleep, whereas during the second half, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is more predominant. Our data show that only REM-rich sleep during the second half of the night promoted good discrimination between fear-relevant and neutral stimuli during recall, while staying awake led to a recovery of discrimination between extinguished and neutral stimuli. This suggests that sleep following extinction contributes independently to successful extinction memory consolidation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26888926,N,no phys of interest,,,

Fifty adolescents (mean age 16.54+/-1.47 years, 56% female, 30 with BD) completed an attention and response inhibition task before and after 20 min of recumbent cycling at ~70% of age-predicted maximum heart rate. 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed in a whole brain voxel-wise analysis and as regions of interest (ROI), examining Go and NoGo response events. In the whole brain analysis of Go trials, exercise had larger effect in BD vs HC throughout ventral prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus; the profile of these effects was of greater disengagement after exercise. Pre-exercise ROI analysis confirmed this 'deficit in deactivation' for BDs in rostral ACC and found an activation deficit on NoGo errors in accumbens. Pre-exercise accumbens NoGo error activity correlated with depression symptoms and Go activity with mania symptoms; no correlations were present after exercise. Performance was matched to controls and results survived a series of covariate analyses. This study provides evidence that acute aerobic exercise transiently changes neural response during an executive task among adolescents with BD, and that pre-exercise relationships between symptoms and neural response are absent after exercise.

Both biochemical and physiological markers have been used to measure stress level. In neuroscience, several studies have related modification of stress level to brain activity changes in limbic system and frontal regions, by using non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). In particular, previous studies suggested that the exhibition or inhibition of certain brain rhythms in frontal cortical areas indicates stress. However, there is no established marker to measure stress level by EEG. In this work, we aimed to prove the usefulness of the prefrontal relative gamma power (RG) for stress assessment. We conducted a study based on stress and relaxation periods. Six healthy subjects performed the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) followed by a stay within a relaxation room while EEG and electrocardiographic signals were recorded. Our results showed that the prefrontal RG correlated with the expected stress level and with the heart rate (HR; 0.8). In addition, the difference in prefrontal RG between time periods of different stress level was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Moreover, the RG was more discriminative between stress levels than alpha asymmetry, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma power in prefrontal cortex. We propose the prefrontal RG as a marker for stress assessment. Compared with other established markers such as the HR or the cortisol, it has higher temporal resolution. Additionally, it needs few electrodes located at non-hairy head positions, thus facilitating the use of non-invasive dry wearable real-time devices for ubiquitous assessment of stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27713698,N,no fmri,,,

Here, we present the mICA toolbox, an open-source GUI toolbox based on FSL command line tools that performs mICA and related analyses in an integrated way. Functions include automated mask generation from atlases, essential preprocessing, mICA-based parcellation, back-reconstruction of whole-brain fc networks from local ones, and reproducibility analysis. Automated slice-wise calculation and cropping are additional functions that reduce computational time and memory requirements for large analyses. To validate our toolbox, we tested these different functions on the cerebellum, hippocampus, and brainstem, using resting-state and task-based data from the Human Connectome Project. In the cerebellum, mICA detected six local networks together with their whole-brain counterparts, closely replicating previous results.

Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of regulating emotion using fMRI and identified brain regions representing reappraisal goals. Using a multimethodological analysis approach, combining standard activation-based and pattern-information analyses, we identified a distributed network of lateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions implicated in reappraisal and within it, a core system that represents reappraisal goals in an abstract, stimulus-independent fashion. Within this core system, the neural pattern-separability in a subset of regions including the left inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobe was related to the success in emotion regulation. Those brain regions might link the prefrontal control regions with the subcortical affective regions.

We found DLPFC to be the central node of the prefrontal emotion regulation network, strongly interconnected with the IFG. The DCM analysis further revealed excitatory changes of connection strength from the DLPFC to the IFG and strong inhibitory changes of connection strength between the IFG and DLPFC during reappraisal.

Here the authors summarize the safety, feasibility, and results of brain CO2 stress testing in adolescents with postconcussion syndrome (PCS) and healthy controls. METHODS This study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Board at the University of Manitoba. Fifteen adolescents with PCS and 17 healthy control subjects underwent anatomical MRI, pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI, and brain stress testing using controlled CO2 challenge and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. Post hoc processing was performed using statistical parametric mapping to determine voxel-by-voxel regional resting CBF and cerebrovascular responsiveness of the brain to the CO2 stimulus (increase in BOLD signal) or the inverse (decrease in BOLD signal). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to compare voxel counts categorized by control (0) or PCS (1). RESULTS Studies were well tolerated without any serious adverse events. Anatomical MRI was normal in all study participants. No differences in CO2 stimuli were seen between the 2 participant groups. No group differences in global mean CBF were detected between PCS patients and healthy controls. Patient-specific differences in mean regional CBF and CO2 BOLD responsiveness were observed in all PCS patients. The ROC curve analysis for brain regions manifesting a voxel response greater than and less than the control atlas (that is, abnormal voxel counts) produced an area under the curve of 0.87 (p < 0.0001) and 0.80 (p = 0.0003), respectively, consistent with a clinically useful predictive model. CONCLUSIONS Adolescent PCS is associated with patient-specific abnormalities in regional mean CBF and BOLD cerebrovascular responsiveness that occur in the setting of normal global resting CBF.

Little is known about individual differences in responding to infant crying. Several theories suggest that people vary in their environmental sensitivity with some responding generally more and some generally less to environmental stimuli. Such differences in environmental sensitivity have been associated with personality traits, including neuroticism. This study investigated whether neuroticism impacts neuronal, physiological, and emotional responses to infant crying by investigating blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large sample of healthy women (N = 102) with simultaneous skin conductance recordings. Participants were repeatedly exposed to a video clip that showed crying infants and emotional responses (valence, arousal, and irritation) were assessed after every video clip presentation. Increased BOLD signal during the perception of crying infants was found in brain regions that are associated with emotional responding, the amygdala and anterior insula. Significant BOLD signal decrements (i.e., habituation) were found in the fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, Broca's homologue on the right hemisphere, (laterobasal) amygdala, and hippocampus. Individuals with high neuroticism showed stronger activation in the amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) when exposed to infant crying compared to individuals with low neuroticism. In contrast to our prediction we found no evidence that neuroticism impacts fMRI-based measures of habituation. Individuals with high neuroticism showed elevated skin conductance responses, experienced more irritation, and perceived infant crying as more unpleasant. The results support the hypothesis that individuals high in neuroticism are more emotionally responsive, experience more negative emotions, and may show enhanced cognitive control during the exposure to infant distress, which may impact infant-directed behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27560361,N,no phys of interest,,,

Imaging with 6-[(18)F]F-DA is constrained, in part, by the bioactivity and neurotoxicity of 6-[(19)F]fluorodopamine. Furthermore, routine access to this radiotracer is limited by the inherent difficulty of incorporation of [(18)F]fluoride into electron-rich aromatic substrates. We describe the simple and direct preparation of high specific activity (SA) 6-[(18)F]F-DA from no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) [(18)F]fluoride. Incorporation of n.c.a. [(18)F]fluoride into a diaryliodonium salt precursor was achieved in 50-75% radiochemical yields (decay corrected to end of bombardment). Synthesis of 6-[(18)F]F-DA on the IBA Synthera(R) and GE TRACERlab FX-FN automated platforms gave 6-[(18)F]F-DA in >99% chemical and radiochemical purities after HPLC purification. The final non-corrected yields of 6-[(18)F]F-DA were 25 +/- 4% (n = 4, 65 min) and 31 +/- 6% (n = 3, 75 min) using the Synthera and TRACERlab modules, respectively. Efficient access to high SA 6-[(18)F]F-DA from a diaryliodonium salt precursor and n.c.a. [(18)F]fluoride is provided by a relatively subtle change in reaction conditions - replacement of a polar aprotic solvent (acetonitrile) with a relatively nonpolar solvent (toluene) during the critical radiofluorination reaction. Implementation of this process on common radiochemistry platforms should make 6-[(18)F]F-DA readily available to the wider imaging community.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26695865,N,methods paper,,,

Even spontaneous fluctuations of the aforementioned physiological signals have been shown to influence the BOLD fMRI signal in a regionally specific manner. Related to this, estimates of functional connectivity between different brain regions, performed when the subject is at rest, may be confounded by the effects of physiological signal fluctuations. Moreover, resting functional connectivity has been shown to vary with respect to time (dynamic functional connectivity), with the sources of this variation not fully elucidated. In this context, we examine the relation between dynamic functional connectivity patterns and the time-varying properties of simultaneously recorded physiological signals (end-tidal CO2 and HR/HRV) using resting-state fMRI measurements from 12 healthy subjects. The results reveal a modulatory effect of the aforementioned physiological signals on the dynamic resting functional connectivity patterns for a number of resting-state networks (default mode network, somatosensory, visual). By using discrete wavelet decomposition, we also show that these modulation effects are more pronounced in specific frequency bands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044987,N,methods paper,,,

Our secondary objectives were to--(i) report a broader range of metabolic and endocrine parameters including body fat composition that could form the basis for the concept of a 'metabolic phenotype' in cognitively normal, older adults, and (ii) to assess whether medications commonly used to control blood lipids, blood pressure or thyroxine affect CMRg values in older adults. Cognition assessed by a battery of tests was normal for age and education in both groups. Compared to the young group (25 years old; n = 34), the older group (72 years old; n = 41) had ~14% lower CMRg (mumol/100 g/min) specifically in the frontal cortex, and 18% lower CMRg in the caudate. Lower grey matter volume and cortical thickness was widespread in the older group. These differences in CMRg, grey matter volume and cortical thickness were present in the absence of any known evidence for prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Percent total body fat was positively correlated with CMRg in many brain regions but only in the older group. Before and after controlling for body fat, HOMA2-IR was significantly positively correlated to CMRg in several brain regions in the older group. These data show that compared to a healthy younger adult, the metabolic phenotype of a cognitively-normal 72 year old person includes similar plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides and TSH, higher hemoglobin A1c and percent body fat, lower CMRg in the superior frontal cortex and caudate, but the same CMRg in the hippocampus and white matter.

The Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes was a randomized trial to evaluate higher (130-149 mm Hg) versus lower (<130 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure targets in participants with recent lacunar infarcts. We evaluated the association of mean achieved blood pressure, 6 months after randomization, and recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and all-cause mortality. After a mean follow up of 3.7 years, there was a J-shaped association between achieved blood pressure and outcomes; the lowest risk was at approximately 124 and 67 mm Hg systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. For example, above a systolic blood pressure of 124 mm Hg, 1 standard deviation higher (11.1 mm Hg) was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 2.7), whereas below this level, this relationship was inverted (0.29; 0.10, 0.79), P<0.001 for interaction. Above a diastolic blood pressure of 67 mm Hg, a 1 standard deviation higher (8.2 mm Hg) was associated with an increased risk of stroke (2.2; 1.4, 3.6), whereas below this level, the association was in the opposite direction (0.34; 0.13, 0.89), P=0.02 for interaction. The lowest risk of all events occurred at a nadir of approximately 120 to 128 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and 65 to 70 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure.

Functional imaging and heart rate variability (HRV) data were acquired from GAD patients and controls during performance of three tracking tasks interspersed with a perseverative cognition (PC) induction. After detection of infrequent target stimuli, activity within putative DMN hubs was suppressed, consistent with a redirection of attentional resources from internal to external focus. This magnitude of activity change was attenuated in patients and individuals with higher trait PC, but was predicted by individual differences in HRV. Following the induction of PC in controls, this pattern of neural reactivity became closer to that of GAD patients.

This study investigated the links between the pressure hyperalgesia, the clinical pain, the degree of the synovitis, inflammatory biomarkers, and tissue-specific biomarkers in KOA patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight KOA patients and 33 pain-free controls participated in this study. The patients were magnetic resonance imaging scanned, and the Boston-Leeds OA Knee Score (BLOKS, 0 to 3) was used to assess the degree of synovitis. The maximal knee pain intensity over the last 24 hours was scored on a visual analog scale (VAS). The pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were assessed over the KOA-affected knee. Serological biomarkers were measured in fasting serum: high-sensitive C-reactive protein, matrix metalloproteinase-mediated degradation of CRP, and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated collagen type I, II, and III degradation (C1M [connective tissue], C2M [cartilage], C3M [synovial membrane]). RESULTS: Compared with controls, the KOA patients showed increased levels of C1M (P<0.02), C2M (P<0.001), and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (P<0.02), decreased level of C3M (P<0.03), and reduced PPTs (P<0.03). Patients with no (BLOKS 0) and moderate to severe (BLOKS 2&3) synovitis had significantly lower PPTs compared with mild synovitis (BLOKS 1). Significantly negative correlations were found between VAS and PPTs. No correlations were found between BLOKS and the VAS, PPT, or biomarkers.

As dopaminergic dysfunction is suggested to affect intrinsic nociceptive processing, this study was designed to characterize laser-induced pain processing in early-stage Parkinson's disease patients in the dopaminergic OFF state, using a multimodal experimental approach at behavioral, autonomic, imaging levels. METHODS: 13 right-handed early-stage Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive or sensory impairment were investigated OFF medication, along with 13 age-matched healthy control subjects. Measurements included warmth perception thresholds, heat pain thresholds, and central pain processing with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (erfMRI) during laser-induced pain stimulation at lower (E = 440 mJ) and higher (E = 640 mJ) target energies. Additionally, electrodermal activity was characterized during delivery of 60 randomized pain stimuli ranging from 440 mJ to 640 mJ, along with evaluation of subjective pain ratings on a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: No significant differences in warmth perception thresholds, heat pain thresholds, electrodermal activity and subjective pain ratings were found between Parkinson's disease patients and controls, and erfMRI revealed a generally comparable activation pattern induced by laser-pain stimuli in brain areas belonging to the central pain matrix. However, relatively reduced deactivation was found in Parkinson's disease patients in posterior regions of the default mode network, notably the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSION: Our data during pain processing extend previous findings suggesting default mode network dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, they argue against a genuine pain-specific processing abnormality in early-stage Parkinson's disease. Future studies are now required using similar multimodal experimental designs to examine pain processing in more advanced stages of Parkinson's disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27776130,N,no corr,,,

Despite its prevalence and adverse associations, neurobiological processes by which prenatal maternal depression (PMD) confers risk remain poorly understood. Maternal mood and fetal behavior were assessed between 34 and 37 gestational weeks. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion MRI, we examined functional and structural connectivity within amygdala-prefrontal circuits in 64 infants (mean age=5.8+/-1.7 weeks) with (n=20) and without (n=44) in utero exposure to PMD. Resting fMRI and diffusion MRI both indicated atypical amygdala-prefrontal connectivity in PMD-exposed infants: Resting fMRI indicated increased inverse, or negative, functional connectivity between the amygdala and the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC), bilaterally, and diffusion MRI indicated decreased structural connectivity between the right amygdala and the right ventral PFC. Spectral dynamic causal modeling supported these findings suggesting altered amygdala-PFC effective (or directed) connectivity in PMD-exposed infants. Last, path analyses supported a mechanistic account relating PMD to a third-trimester fetal behavior: PMD alters amygdala-PFC connectivity, which in turn, is associated with an increase in fetal heart rate reactivity to in utero perturbation. These data suggest that the maturation and coordination of central and peripheral physiology are altered by prenatal exposure to maternal depression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to directly associate infant MRI measures with a behavior-fetal heart rate response, and supports hypotheses that PMD-associated variations in the development of amygdala-PFC circuits are relevant for future neurobehavioral maturation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27801896,N,infants,,,

In contrast, this study investigated the noninstructed experience and evaluation of an emotional conflict, where positive or negative cues can be subjectively prioritized. To this end, healthy participants freely watched short film scenes that evoked emotional conflicts while their BOLD responses were measured. Participants' individual ratings of conflict and valence perception during the film scenes were collected immediately afterwards, and the individual ratings were regressed against the BOLD data. Our analyses revealed that (a) amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex were significantly involved in prioritizing positive or negative cues, but not in subjective evaluations of conflict per se, and (b) superior temporal sulcus (STS) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), which have been implicated in social cognition and emotion control, were involved in both prioritizing positive or negative cues and subjectively evaluating conflict, and may thus constitute ""hubs"" or ""switches"" in emotional conflict processing. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses further revealed stronger functional connectivity between IPL and ventral prefrontal-medial parietal areas in prioritizing negative cues, and stronger connectivity between STS and dorsal-rostral prefrontal-medial parietal areas in prioritizing positive cues. In sum, our results suggest that IPL and STS are important in the subjective evaluation of complex conflicts and influence valence prioritization via prefrontal and parietal control centers.

METHODS: T-values within the visual cortex obtained with analysis tools that assume a first-order autoregressive plus white noise process (AR(1)+w) with a fixed AR coefficient versus higher-order AR models with spatially varying AR coefficients were compared. In addition, dependency of T-values on correction of physiological noise (respiration, heart rate) was evaluated. RESULTS: Optimal statistical power was obtained for a TR of 0.33 s, but T-values as obtained by AR(1)+w models were strongly dependent on the predefined AR coefficients in fMRI with short TRs which required higher-order AR models to achieve stable statistics. Direct estimation of AR coefficients revealed the highest values within the default mode network while physiological noise had little influence on statistics in cortical structures. CONCLUSION: Colored noise in event-related fMRI obtained at short TRs originates mainly from neural sources and calls for more sophisticated correction of serial autocorrelations which cannot be achieved with standard methods relying on AR(1)+w models with globally fixed AR coefficients.

METHODS: Indirect calorimetry and supraclavicular thermography was performed in 11 healthy male volunteers before and after: cold exposure; glucagon infusion (at 23 degrees C); and vehicle infusion (at 23 degrees C). All volunteers underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning with cold exposure. Subjects with cold-induced BAT activation on (18)F-FDG PET/CT (n = 8) underwent a randomly allocated second (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan (at 23 degrees C), either with glucagon infusion (n = 4) or vehicle infusion (n = 4). RESULTS: We observed that EE increased by 14% after cold exposure and by 15% after glucagon infusion (50 ng/kg/min; p < 0.05 vs control for both). Cold exposure produced an increase in neck temperature (+0.44 degrees C; p < 0.001 vs control), but glucagon infusion did not alter neck temperature. In subjects with a cold-induced increase in the metabolic activity of supraclavicular BAT on (18)F-FDG PET/CT, a significant rise in the metabolic activity of BAT after glucagon infusion was not detected. Cold exposure increased sympathetic activation, as measured by circulating norepinephrine levels, but glucagon infusion did not. CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon increases EE by a similar magnitude compared with cold activation, but independently of BAT thermogenesis.

Participants underwent fear conditioning (day 1) and fear extinction and experimental return-of-fear (ROF) induction through reinstatement (a model for adversity-induced relapse; day 2). Ratings, autonomic (skin conductance response) and neuronal activation measures (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) were acquired. Individuals exposed to RA showed a generalized (that is, not CS- specific) fear recall and ROF, whereas unexposed individuals showed differential (that is, CS+ specific) fear recall and ROF on an autonomic level despite no group differences during fear acquisition and extinction learning. These group differences in ROF were accompanied by corresponding activation differences in brain areas known to be involved in fear processing and differentiability/generalization of ROF (that is, hippocampus). In addition, dimensional measures of RA, CA and lifetime adversity were negatively correlated with differential skin conductance responses (SCRs) during ROF and hippocampal activation. As discriminating signals of danger and safety, as well as a tendency for overgeneralization, are core features in clinically anxious populations, these deficits may specifically contribute to relapse risk following exposure to adversity, in particular to recent adversity.

Differential RI was linked to CS+ related hippocampal activation and CS- related disinhibition of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The latter likely contributes to robust generalized RI which was mirrored in thalamic and visual areas (as well as the bed nucleus of the striatum and inusula) possibly indicating generally facilitated salience processing. In addition, we also present data on experimental boundary conditions of RI (trial sequence effects, time stability). Taken together, this first comprehensive analysis of RI-induced ROF aids not only experimental research on ROF but also understanding of factors promoting clinical relapse and the role of the vmPFC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26612681,Y,corr,uns,,
The tipping point: Value differences and parallel dorsal-ventral frontal circuits gating human approach-avoidance behavior,Neuroimage,"Schlund, Michael W,Brewer, Adam T,Magee, Sandy K,Richman, David M,Solomon, Scott,Ludlum, MaDonna,Dymond, Simon,eng,Neuroimage. 2016 Aug 1;136:94-105. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.04.070. Epub 2016 May 3.","Excessive avoidance and diminished approach behavior are both prominent features of anxiety, trauma and stress related disorders. Despite this, little is known about the neuronal mechanisms supporting gating of human approach-avoidance behavior. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to track dorsal anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal (dACC/dmPFC) activation along an approach-avoidance continuum to assess sensitivity to competing appetitive and aversive contingencies and correspondence with behavior change. Behavioral and fMRI experiments were conducted using a novel approach-avoidance task where a monetary reward appeared in the presence of a conditioned stimulus (CS), or threat, that signaled increasing probability of unconditioned stimulus (US) delivery. Approach produced the reward or probabilistic US, while avoidance prevented US delivery, and across trials, reward remained fixed while the CS threat level varied unpredictably. Increasing the CS threat level (i.e., US probability) produced the desired approach-avoidance transition and inverted U-shaped changes in decision times, electrodermal activity and activation in pregenual ACC, dACC/dmPFC, striatum, anterior insula and inferior frontal regions. Conversely, U-shaped changes in activation were observed in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and bimodal changes in the orbitofrontal and ventral hippocampus. These new results show parallel dorsal-ventral frontal circuits support gating of human approach-avoidance behavior where dACC/dmPFC signals inversely correlate with value differences between approach and avoidance contingencies while ventral frontal signals correlate with the value of predictable outcomes. Our findings provide an important bridge between basic research on brain mechanisms of value-guided decision-making and value-focused clinical theories of anxiety and related interventions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153979,N,no phys of interest,,,

We evaluated sympathetic (skin conductance level) and cardiovagal (high-frequency heart rate variability) modulation, collected synchronously with functional MRI (fMRI) data during nauseogenic visual stimulation aimed to induce vection in susceptible individuals. Autonomic data guided analysis of neuroimaging data, using a stimulus-based (analysis windows set by visual stimulation protocol) and percept-based (windows set by subjects' ratings) approach. Increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic modulation was associated with robust and anti-correlated brain activity in response to nausea. Specifically, greater autonomic response was associated with reduced fMRI signal in brain regions such as the insula, suggesting an inhibitory relationship with premotor brainstem nuclei. Interestingly, some sympathetic/parasympathetic specificity was noted. Activity in default mode network and visual motion areas was anti-correlated with parasympathetic outflow at peak nausea. In contrast, lateral prefrontal cortical activity was anti-correlated with sympathetic outflow during recovery, soon after cessation of nauseogenic stimulation. These results suggest divergent central autonomic control for sympathetic and parasympathetic response to nausea. Autonomic outflow and the central autonomic network underlying ANS response to nausea may be an important determinant of overall nausea intensity and, ultimately, a potential therapeutic target.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115821,Y,corr,uns,,

We applied ultrahigh-field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the improved spatial resolution it affords (1.2 mm isotropic), to evaluate putative brainstem nuclei that control and/or sense pain-evoked cardiovagal modulation (high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) instantaneously estimated through a point-process approach). The time-variant HF-HRV signal was used to guide the general linear model analysis of neuroimaging data. Sustained (6 min) pain stimulation reduced cardiovagal modulation, with the most prominent reduction evident in the first 2 min. Brainstem nuclei associated with pain-evoked HF-HRV reduction were previously implicated in both autonomic regulation and pain processing. Specifically, clusters consistent with the rostral ventromedial medulla, ventral nucleus reticularis (Rt)/nucleus ambiguus (NAmb) and pontine nuclei (Pn) were found when contrasting sustained pain versus rest. Analysis of the initial 2-min period identified Rt/NAmb and Pn, in addition to clusters consistent with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus/nucleus of the solitary tract and locus coeruleus. Combining high spatial resolution fMRI and high temporal resolution HF-HRV allowed for a non-invasive characterization of brainstem nuclei, suggesting that nociceptive afference induces pain-processing brainstem nuclei to function in concert with known premotor autonomic nuclei in order to affect the cardiovagal response to pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044996,Y,corr,fixed,,Y

Integrated states enable faster and more accurate performance on a cognitive task, and are associated with dilations in pupil diameter, suggesting that ascending neuromodulatory systems may govern the transition between these alternative modes of brain function.

Epub 2016 Oct 20.","Recent advancements in PET instrumentation have made the non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular function in small animals a reality. The majority of small animal PET systems use stationary detector gantries, thus affording high temporal resolution imaging of cardiac function. Systems designed to maximize spatial resolution and detection sensitivity employing rotating gantry designs are suboptimal when high temporal resolution imaging is needed. To overcome this limitation, the current work developed a novel view-sharing data analysis scheme suitable for dynamic cardiac PET imaging using (18)F-NaF as the tracer and tracer kinetic model analysis. This scheme was tested in a rat model of cardiovascular function where the relationship between direct transonic flow measures of cardiac output were highly correlated (f(x) = 1.0216x - 24.233, R = 0.9158, p < 0.001) with the new model. Similarly, derived measures of stroke volume were also highly correlated (f(x) = 0.9655x - 0.0428, R = 0.9453, p < 0.001) with the current approach. Administration of xylazine caused a statistically significant increase in stroke volume (0.32 +/- 0.07 ml, p = 0.003, n = 4) and a significant decrease in both heart rate (-155 +/- 7.1 beats/min, p < 0.001, n = 4) and cardiac output (-75.9 +/- 23.0 ml/kg min, p = 0.01, n = 4).

Epub 2016 Apr 4.","PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of low-intensity running performed immediately after lower-body power-training sessions on power development. METHODS: Twenty young females participated in 6 weeks, 3/week, of either lower body power training (PT) or lower body power training followed by 30 min of low-intensity running (PET) eliciting 60-70 % of maximal heart rate. The following were measured before and after the training period: counter-movement jump, isometric leg press force and rate of force development (RFD), half squat 1-RM, vastus lateralis fiber type composition and cross sectional area, resting intramuscular fiber conduction velocity (MFCV), and heart rate during the modified Bruce treadmill test. RESULTS: Counter-movement jump height and peak power increased after PT (10.7 +/- 6.2 and 12.9 +/- 18.7 %, p < 0.05) but not after PET (3.4 +/- 7.6 and 5.11 +/- 10.94 %, p > 0.05). Maximum isometric force, RFD, and half squat 1-RM increased similarly in both groups. Muscle fiber type composition was not altered in either group. Muscle fiber cross sectional area increased only after PT (17.5 +/- 17.4, 14.5 +/- 10.4, 20.36 +/- 11.3 %, in type I, IIA, and IIX fibers, respectively, p < 0.05). Likewise, mean MFCV increased with PT only (before: 4.53 +/- 0.38 m s(-1), after: 5.09 +/- 0.39 m s(-1), p = 0.027). Submaximal heart rate during the Bruce treadmill test remained unchanged after PT but decreased after PET. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that low-intensity running performed after lower-body power training impairs the exercise-induced adaptation in stretch-shortening cycle jumping performance (vertical jump height, peak power), during the first 6 weeks of training, which may be partially linked to inhibited muscle fiber hypertrophy and muscle fiber conduction velocity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27040693,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2016 Mar 2.","OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Vascular graft infection is a serious and challenging complication. In situations when neither traditional radical surgery nor conservative negative pressure wound therapy (VAC) alone, are considered feasible or safe, for example due to bleeding, adverse anatomy, or severe comorbidity, a novel hybrid procedure was developed. The EndoVAC technique consists of (i) relining of the infected reconstruction with a stent graft; (ii) surgical revision (without clamping the reconstruction); and (iii) VAC therapy, to permit granulation and secondary delayed healing, and long-term antibiotic treatment. The aim of the study is to report long-term follow up data of this new treatment modality. METHODS: From November 2007 to June 2015, 17 EndoVAC procedures were performed in 16 patients (eight men, aged 16-91 years): six infected carotid patches after carotid endarterectomy, three infected neck deviations, two infected femoro-popliteal bypasses, three infected patches after femoral thrombo-endarterectomy, and two infected vascular accesses. Surveillance was performed routinely every 3-6 months and included clinical examination, hematologic tests, duplex ultrasonography, and imaging techniques, including 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. RESULTS: Primary technical success rate was 100%. Antibiotics were prescribed for a median of 3 months (range 1-20 months). The median duration of VAC treatment was 14 days (range 9-57 days). Complications included early, transient stroke (n = 1), temporary hypoglossal palsy (n = 1), and late, asymptomatic occluded bypasses (n = 2), stent graft thrombosis (n = 1), and moderate carotid stenosis (n = 1). After a median of 5 years (range 1-90 months) of follow up, all patients had healed graft infections with no recurrence was observed. Eight patients died as a result of severe comorbidities, unrelated to the infection or hybrid procedure, 1 month-7 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: The EndoVAC technique is an alternative, less invasive, option for treatment of infected vascular reconstructions in selected cases, when neither traditional radical surgery, nor conservative simple negative pressure wound therapy are considered feasible or safe. The exact indications for this alternative hybrid treatment need to be established.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26944600,N,no phys of interest,,,

Approximately 25% to 40% of patients with stroke, largely younger patients, are not associated with any conventional stroke risk factors. In this research, we explored whether fibromyalgia (FM), a neuropsychosomatic disorder, increases stroke risk.From a claims dataset with one million enrollees sourced of the Taiwan National Health Insurance database, we selected 47,279 patients with FM and randomly selected 189,112 age- and sex-matched controls within a 3-year period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002. Stroke risk was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.Comorbidities associated with increased stroke risk, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis, were more prevalent in patients with FM and high stroke risk than in the controls. The overall stroke risk was 1.25-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-1.30) higher in the FM group than in the non-FM group. Even without comorbidities, stroke risk was higher in patients with FM than in the controls (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.35-1.53, P < 0.001). The relative risk of stroke was 2.26-fold between FM and non-FM groups in younger patients (age <35 years, 95% CI: 1.86-2.75).This is the first investigation associating FM with an increased risk of stroke development.

We hypothesized that 1) the Pa-PETCO2 would be greater in hypoxia compared with normoxia, 2) the Pa-PETCO2 would be similar, whereas the PET-PaO2 gradient would be greater in those with a PFO, 3) the HCVR and CVR would be underestimated when plotted against PETCO2 compared with PaCO2, and 4) previously derived prediction algorithms will accurately target PaCO2. PETCO2 was controlled by dynamic end-tidal forcing in steady-state steps of -8, -4, 0, +4, and +8 mmHg from baseline in normoxia and hypoxia. Minute ventilation (VE), internal carotid artery blood flow (QICA), middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv), and temperature corrected end-tidal and arterial blood gases were measured throughout experimentation. HCVR and CVR were calculated using linear regression analysis by indexing VE and relative changes in QICA, and MCAv against PETCO2, predicted PaCO2, and measured PaCO2. The Pa-PETCO2 was similar between hypoxia and normoxia and PFO+ and PFO-. The PET-PaO2 was greater in PFO+ by 2.1 mmHg during normoxia (P = 0.003). HCVR and CVR plotted against PETCO2 underestimated HCVR and CVR indexed against PaCO2 in normoxia and hypoxia. Our PaCO2 prediction equation modestly improved estimates of HCVR and CVR.

In addition, activity in frontal and parietal regions predicted WM performance, and mediation analyses identified regions in the bilateral IPS that mediated the performance-impairing effects of social threat. Social threat also decreased connectivity between the IPS and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while increasing connectivity between the IPS and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region strongly implicated in the generation of autonomic and emotional responses.

Its cardiovascular profile suggests a role in the regulation of gestational hemodynamics. METHODS: We longitudinally assessed maternal serum apelin levels and hemodynamics (cardiac output and total peripheral resistance) between 20 and 34 weeks gestation in 18 women at high risk of placental dysfunction. Placental apelin staining was assessed by immunohistochemistry in placentas from uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 6), preterm deliveries (n = 6), preeclampsia (PET, n = 8), and isolated intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR, n = 8). Placental apelin gene expression was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In the high-risk cohort, 4 fetuses developed isolated IUGR and 6 women developed PET. We obtained a median of 5 (range 2-9) hemodynamic and apelin measurements per woman. Apelin levels throughout gestation were best fitted by a quadratic curve. Apelin levels between 20 and 26 weeks gestation correlated with total peripheral resistance (r = .57, P = .01) and showed a trend toward an inverse correlation with stroke volume (r = -.42, P = .08). Apelin serum levels were 30% lower in pregnancies complicated by IUGR than in uncomplicated pregnancies or in women with preeclampsia (P = .009). Placental apelin gene expression was similar in IUGR, PET, preterm, and term normal placentas. Apelin staining was seen both in syncytiotrophoblast and stroma of the placental villi. In IUGR placentas, apelin staining was strongly decreased in both compartments compared to normals. Preeclamptic placentas showed an intermediate staining.

Identification of lateralized aldosterone secretion led to right adrenalectomy, followed by normalization of biochemical and hormonal parameters and amelioration of blood pressure. The resected adrenal showed three nodules, one of them expressing aldosterone synthase and harboring a somatic KNCJ5 mutation. A Weiss revisited index of 3 of the APA prompted us to perform a second 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography after surgery, which revealed abnormal rectal activity despite the absence of clinical symptoms. Gastrointestinal exploration showed multiple polyps with severe dysplasia, and the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis was established in the presence of a germline heterozygous APC gene mutation. Sequencing of somatic DNA from the APA and a second adrenal nodule revealed biallelic APC inactivation due to loss of heterozygosity in both nodules. CONCLUSIONS: This case report underlines the need for establishing the frequency of germline APC variants in patients with primary aldosteronism and bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia because their presence may predispose to APA development and severe hypertension well before the first familial adenomatous polyposis symptoms appear. From a mechanistic point of view, it supports a two-hit model for APA development, whereby the first hit drives increased cell proliferation whereas the second hit specifies the pattern of hormonal secretion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27648962,N,case study,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 28.","The study attempted to explore that the synergistic effect of acupoints combination is not a simple superposition of single acupoint's effect by comparing and analyzing the changes of blood pressure (BP), SF-36, and brain regions after acupuncture treatment. 47 patients were randomly divided into LR3+KI3 group, LR3 group, and KI3 group. Subjects received Rs-fMRI scan, BP measurement, and SF-36 questionnaires before and after treatment and short-term acupuncture treatment. After treatment, there were no significant differences in BP and SF-36 among 3 groups, compared to the case before treatment, SBP of 3 groups decreased, and DBP significantly decreased while vitality and mental health significantly increased in LR3+KI3 group. Both number and scopes of changes of brain regions in LR3+KI3 group were the largest, which mainly included BAs 3, 4, 8, 19, 21, 24, 32, 44, and 45. In conclusion, acupuncture at LR3+KI3 may auxiliarily reduce BP and improve the vitality and mental health of patients, and the changes of brain regions were related to somatesthesia, movement, vision, audition, emotion and mood, language, memory, etc. BAs 4, 9, 10, 24, 31, 32, and 46 may be the targeting brain areas of acupuncture in assisting hypotension. It is suggested that acupoints combination of LR3+KI3 maybe generates a synergistic effect, and it is not simple sum of single acupoint effect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28003850,N,no corr,,,

Computational models and prominent theoretical frameworks indicate that this should enhance the precision of neural representations, but direct empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. In two functional MRI studies, we examine the effect of baseline catecholamine levels (as indexed by pupil diameter and manipulated pharmacologically) on the precision of object representations in the human ventral temporal cortex using angular dispersion, a powerful, multivariate metric of representational similarity (precision). We first report the results of computational model simulations indicating that increasing catecholaminergic gain should reduce the angular dispersion, and thus increase the precision, of object representations from the same category, as well as reduce the angular dispersion of object representations from distinct categories when distinct-category representations overlap. In Study 1 (N = 24), we show that angular dispersion covaries with pupil diameter, an index of baseline catecholamine levels. In Study 2 (N = 24), we manipulate catecholamine levels and neural gain using the norepinephrine transporter blocker atomoxetine and demonstrate consistent, causal effects on angular dispersion and brain-wide functional connectivity. Despite the use of very different methods of examining the effect of baseline catecholamine levels, our results show a striking convergence and demonstrate that catecholamines increase the precision of neural representations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Norepinephrine and dopamine are among the most widely distributed and ubiquitous neuromodulators in the mammalian brain and have a profound and pervasive impact on cognition. Baseline catecholamine levels tend to increase with increasing task engagement in tasks involving perceptual decisions, yet there is currently no direct evidence of the specific impact of these increases in catecholamine levels on perceptual encoding. Our results fill this void by showing that catecholamines enhance the precision of encoding cortical object representations, and by suggesting that this effect is mediated by increases in neural gain, thus offering a mechanistic account of our key finding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27225761,N,FC,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 23.","Positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) is a promising technique for imaging tumour hypoxia, and a potential target for radiotherapy dose-painting. However, the relationship between FMISO uptake and oxygen partial pressure ([Formula: see text]) is yet to be quantified fully. Tissue oxygenation varies over distances much smaller than clinical PET resolution (<100 mum versus approximately 4 mm), and cyclic variations in tumour perfusion have been observed on timescales shorter than typical FMISO PET studies ( approximately 20 min versus a few hours). Furthermore, tracer uptake may be decreased in voxels containing some degree of necrosis. This work develops a computational model of FMISO uptake in millimetre-scale tumour regions. Coupled partial differential equations govern the evolution of oxygen and FMISO distributions, and a dynamic vascular source map represents temporal variations in perfusion. Local FMISO binding capacity is modulated by the necrotic fraction. Outputs include spatiotemporal maps of [Formula: see text] and tracer accumulation, enabling calculation of tissue-to-blood ratios (TBRs) and time-activity curves (TACs) as a function of mean tissue oxygenation. The model is characterised using experimental data, finding half-maximal FMISO binding at local [Formula: see text] of 1.4 mmHg (95% CI: 0.3-2.6 mmHg) and half-maximal necrosis at 1.2 mmHg (0.1-4.9 mmHg). Simulations predict a non-linear non-monotonic relationship between FMISO activity (4 hr post-injection) and mean tissue [Formula: see text] : tracer uptake rises sharply from negligible levels in avascular tissue, peaking at approximately 5 mmHg and declining towards blood activity in well-oxygenated conditions. Greater temporal variation in perfusion increases peak TBRs (range 2.20-5.27) as a result of smaller predicted necrotic fraction, rather than fundamental differences in FMISO accumulation under acute hypoxia. Identical late FMISO uptake can occur in regions with differing [Formula: see text] and necrotic fraction, but simulated TACs indicate that additional early-phase information may allow discrimination of hypoxic and necrotic signals. We conclude that a robust approach to FMISO interpretation (and dose-painting prescription) is likely to be based on dynamic PET analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27880734,N,no phys of interest,,,

It has been postulated that the integrative monitoring of the bodily responses to environmental stimuli is crucial for the recognition and experience of emotions. Because emotional arousal is known to be closely coupled to functions of the anterior insula, we suspected laughter to be associated primarily with neuronal activity in this region. An anatomically constrained re-analysis of our imaging data pertaining to ticklish laughter, to inhibited ticklish laughter, and to voluntary laughter revealed regional differences in the levels of neuronal activity in the posterior and mid-/anterior portions of the insula. Ticklish laughter was associated specifically with right ventral anterior insular activity, which was not detected under the other two conditions.

We determined the cumulative incidences and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of mesenteric ischemia.

The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity during a variation of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) in 53 young adults. Salivary cortisol was assessed as an index of the stress response, trait anxiety was assessed as an index of an individual's disposition toward negative affectivity, and self-reported stress was assessed as an index of an individual's subjective psychological experience. Heart rate and skin conductance responses were also assessed as additional measures of physiological reactivity. Dorsomedial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and inferior parietal lobule demonstrated differential activity during the MIST. Further, differences in salivary cortisol reactivity to the MIST were associated with ventromedial PFC and posterior cingulate activity, while trait anxiety and self-reported stress were associated with dorsomedial and ventromedial PFC activity, respectively.

We used a cued fear conditioning design with extinction and a post-extinction phase to provoke the return of fear and examined the role of the interplay of amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal regions. METHODS: We compared 18 PTSD patients with two healthy control groups: 18 trauma-exposed subjects without PTSD (nonPTSD) and 18 healthy controls (HC) without trauma experience. They underwent a three-day ABC-conditioning procedure in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Two geometric shapes that served as conditioned stimuli (CS) were presented in the context of virtual reality scenes. Electric painful stimuli were delivered after one of the two shapes (CS+) during acquisition (in context A), while the other (CS-) was never paired with pain. Extinction was performed in context B and extinction memory was tested in a novel context C. RESULTS: The PTSD patients showed significantly higher differential skin conductance responses than the non-PTSD and HC and higher differential amygdala and hippocampus activity than the HC in context C. In addition, elevated arousal to the CS+ during extinction and to the CS- throughout the experiment was present in the PTSD patients but self-reported differential valence or contingency were not different. During extinction recall, differential amygdala activity correlated positively with the intensity of numbing and ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity correlated positively with behavioral avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD patients show heightened return of fear in neural and peripheral measures. In addition, self-reported arousal was high to both danger (CS+) and safety (CS-) cues. These results suggest that a deficient maintenance of extinction and a failure to identify safety signals might contribute to PTSD symptoms, whereas non-PTSD subjects seem to show normal responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27686278,N,no phys of interest,,,

Most of the time the HRF is associated with task-based fMRI protocols, in which its onset is explicitly included in the design matrix. On the other hand, the HRF also mediates the relationship between spontaneous neural activity and the BOLD signal in resting-state protocols, in which no explicit stimulus is taken into account. It has been shown that resting-state brain dynamics can be characterized by looking at sparse BOLD 'events', which can be retrieved by point process analysis. These events can be then used to retrieve the HRF at rest. Crucially, cardiac activity can also induce changes in the BOLD signal, thus affecting both the number of these events and the estimation of the haemodynamic response. In this study, we compare the resting-state haemodynamic response retrieved by means of a point process analysis, taking the cardiac fluctuations into account. We find that the resting-state HRF estimation is significantly modulated in the brainstem and surrounding cortical areas. From the analysis of two high-quality datasets with different temporal and spatial resolution, and through the investigation of intersubject correlation, we suggest that spontaneous point process response durations are associated with the mean interbeat interval and low-frequency power of heart rate variability in the brainstem.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044997,N,methods paper,,,

In this study, we employed representational similarity analysis (RSA) to reveal the multi-voxel fMRI patterns in the OFC associated with value processing during the anticipatory and the consummatory phases. We found that multi-voxel activation patterns in the OFC encoded magnitude and partial valence information (win vs. loss) but not outcome (favourable vs. unfavourable) during reward consummation. Furthermore, the lateral OFC rather than the medial OFC encoded loss information. Also, we found that OFC encoded values in a similar way to the ventral striatum (VS) or the anterior insula (AI) during reward anticipation regardless of motivated response and to the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the VS in reward consummation.

Recent human imaging studies demonstrated that activity in some cortical regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula cortex (aIC), is related to sympathetic activity. However, little is known about the functional brain connectivity related to sympathetic response to fearful stimuli. The participants were 32 healthy, right-handed volunteers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine brain activity when watching horror and control movies. Fingertip temperature was taken during the scanning as a measure of sympathetic response. The movies were watched a second time, and the degree of fear (9-point Likert-type scale) was evaluated every three seconds. The brain activity of the ACC, bilateral aIC, and bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) was correlated with the change rate of fingertip temperature, with or without fearful stimuli. Functional connectivity analysis revealed significantly greater positive functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ACC and between the amygdala and the aIC when watching the horror movie than when watching the control movie. Whole-brain psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that the functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the ACC was modulated according to the fear rating. Our results indicate that the increased functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the ACC represents a sympathetic response to fearful stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27107469,N,finger tip temp?,,,

We have previously developed an event-by-event respiratory motion-correction method with correlations between internal organ motion and external respiratory signals (INTEX). This method is uniquely appropriate for dynamic imaging because it corrects motion for each time point. In this study, we applied INTEX to human dynamic PET studies with various tracers and investigated the impact on kinetic parameter estimation. METHODS: The use of 3 tracers-a myocardial perfusion tracer, (82)Rb (n = 7); a pancreatic beta-cell tracer, (18)F-FP(+)DTBZ (n = 4); and a tumor hypoxia tracer, (18)F-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO) (n = 1)-was investigated in a study of 12 human subjects. Both rest and stress studies were performed for (82)Rb. The Anzai belt system was used to record respiratory motion. Three-dimensional internal organ motion in high temporal resolution was calculated by INTEX to guide event-by-event respiratory motion correction of target organs in each dynamic frame. Time-activity curves of regions of interest drawn based on end-expiration PET images were obtained. For (82)Rb studies, K1 was obtained with a 1-tissue model using a left-ventricle input function. Rest-stress myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) were determined. For (18)F-FP(+)DTBZ studies, the total volume of distribution was estimated with arterial input functions using the multilinear analysis 1 method. For the (18)F-FMISO study, the net uptake rate Ki was obtained with a 2-tissue irreversible model using a left-ventricle input function. All parameters were compared with the values derived without motion correction. RESULTS: With INTEX, K1 and MBF increased by 10% +/- 12% and 15% +/- 19%, respectively, for (82)Rb stress studies. CFR increased by 19% +/- 21%. For studies with motion amplitudes greater than 8 mm (n = 3), K1, MBF, and CFR increased by 20% +/- 12%, 30% +/- 20%, and 34% +/- 23%, respectively. For (82)Rb rest studies, INTEX had minimal effect on parameter estimation. The total volume of distribution of (18)F-FP(+)DTBZ and Ki of (18)F-FMISO increased by 17% +/- 6% and 20%, respectively.

Although a central role for the amygdala is well established [4], both human and animal studies implicate other brain regions in learning, notably ventral striatum and cerebellum [5]. It remains unclear whether these regions make different contributions to a single aversive learning process or represent independent learning mechanisms that interact to generate the expression of pain-related behavior. We designed a human parallel aversive conditioning paradigm in which different Pavlovian visual cues probabilistically predicted thermal pain primarily to either the left or right arm and studied the acquisition of conditioned Pavlovian responses using combined physiological recordings and fMRI. Using computational modeling based on reinforcement learning theory, we found that conditioning involves two distinct types of learning process. First, a non-specific ""preparatory"" system learns aversive facial expressions and autonomic responses such as skin conductance. The associated learning signals-the learned associability and prediction error-were correlated with fMRI brain responses in amygdala-striatal regions, corresponding to the classic aversive (fear) learning circuit. Second, a specific lateralized system learns ""consummatory"" limb-withdrawal responses, detectable with electromyography of the arm to which pain is predicted. Its related learned associability was correlated with responses in ipsilateral cerebellar cortex, suggesting a novel computational role for the cerebellum in pain.

Stress may act via central nervous system pathways to affect visceral sensitivity and motility thus exacerbating gastrointestinal symptoms. The neural substrate underpinning these mechanisms needs to be investigated in CD. We conducted an explorative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in order to investigate potential differences in the brain stress response in CD patients compared to controls. METHODS: 17 CD patients and 17 healthy controls underwent a fMRI scan while performing a stressful task consisting in a Stroop color-word interference task designed to induce mental stress in the fMRI environment. KEY RESULTS: Compared to controls, in CD patients the stress task elicited greater blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in the midcingulate cortex (MCC). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The MCC integrate ""high"" emotional processes with afferent sensory information ascending from the gut. In light of these integrative functions, the stress-evoked MCC hyperactivity in CD patients might represent a plausible neural substrate for the association between stress and symptomatic disease. The MCC dysfunction might be involved in mechanisms of central disinhibition of nociceptive inputs leading to amplify the visceral sensitivity. Finally, the stress-evoked MCC hyperactivity might affect the regulation of intestinal motility resulting in exacerbation of disease symptoms and the autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation of inflammation resulting in enhanced inflammatory activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560758,N,no HC corr,,,

To control for non-anxiolytic effects of repeated exposure, rCBF was also measured during repeated presentations of neutral and angry facial expressions. Results showed that anxiety ratings and heart rate decreased from the first to the second speech, indicating an anxiolytic effect of repeated exposure. Exposure attenuated rCBF in the amygdala whereas no change in rCBF was observed in the vmPFC or hippocampus.

Individuals who are at high risk of SUDEP exhibit regional brain structural and functional connectivity (FC) alterations compared with low-risk patients. However, less is known about network-based FC differences among critical cortical and subcortical autonomic regulatory brain structures in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients at high risk of SUDEP. METHODS: 32 TLE patients were risk-stratified according to the following clinical criteria: age of epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and presence of nocturnal seizures, resulting in 14 high-risk and 18 low-risk cases. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal time courses were extracted from 11 bilateral cortical and subcortical brain regions involved in autonomic and other regulatory processes. After computing all pairwise correlations, FC matrices were analyzed using the network-based statistic. FC strength among the 11 brain regions was compared between the high- and low-risk patients. Increases and decreases in FC were sought, using high-risk > low-risk and low-risk > high-risk contrasts (with covariates age, gender, lateralization of epilepsy, and presence of hippocampal sclerosis). RESULTS: High-risk TLE patients showed a subnetwork with significantly reduced FC (t = 2.5, p = 0.029) involving the thalamus, brain stem, anterior cingulate, putamen and amygdala, and a second subnetwork with significantly elevated FC (t = 2.1, p = 0.031), which extended to medial/orbital frontal cortex, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, subcallosal cortex, brain stem, thalamus, caudate, and putamen. CONCLUSION: TLE patients at high risk of SUDEP showed widespread FC differences between key autonomic regulatory brain regions compared to those at low risk. The altered FC revealed here may help to shed light on the functional correlates of autonomic disturbances in epilepsy and mechanisms involved in SUDEP. Furthermore, these findings represent possible objective biomarkers which could help to identify high-risk patients and enhance SUDEP risk stratification via the use of non-invasive neuroimaging, which would require validation in larger cohorts, with extension to patients with other epilepsies and subjects who succumb to SUDEP.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085330,N,no HC corr,,,

Epub 2017 Mar 6.","The ability to assign safety to stimuli in the environment is integral to everyday functioning. A key brain region for this evaluation is the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). To investigate the importance of vmPFC safety signaling, we used neuroimaging of Pavlovian fear reversal, a paradigm that involves flexible updating when the contingencies for a threatening (CS+) and safe (CS-) stimulus reverse, in a prototypical disorder of inflexible behavior influenced by anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Skin conductance responses in OCD patients (n = 43) failed to differentiate during reversal compared with healthy controls (n = 35), although significant differentiation did occur during early conditioning and amygdala BOLD signaling was unaffected in these patients. Increased vmPFC activation (for CS+ > CS-) during early conditioning predicted the degree of generalization in OCD patients during reversal, whereas vmPFC safety signals were absent throughout learning in these patients. Regions of the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate, insula, and thalamus) showed early learning task-related hyperconnectivity with the vmPFC in OCD, consistent with biased processing of the CS+. Our findings reveal an absence of vmPFC safety signaling in OCD, undermining flexible threat updating and explicit contingency knowledge. Although differential threat learning can occur to some extent in the absence of vmPFC safety signals, effective CS- signaling becomes crucial during conflicting threat and safety cues. These results promote further investigation of vmPFC safety signaling in other anxiety disorders, with potential implications for the development of exposure-based therapies, in which safety signaling is likely to play a key role.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28265059,N,no corr,,,

METHODS: We studied patients recruited with perfusion imaging in the Third International Stroke Trial. We rated individual SVD features (leukoaraiosis, lacunes) and brain atrophy on baseline plain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Separately, we assessed white matter at the level of the lateral ventricles in the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the stroke for visible areas of hypoperfusion (present or absent) on 4 time-based perfusion imaging parameters. We examined associations between SVD features (individually and summed) and presence of hypoperfusion using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, hypertension, and diabetes. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients with median (interquartile range) age of 81 (72-86) years, 78 (52%) of which were male, had complete perfusion data. Hypoperfusion was most frequent on mean transit time (MTT; 63 patients, 55%) and least frequent on time to maximum flow (19 patients, 17%). The SVD score showed stronger independent associations with hypoperfusion (e.g., MTT, odds ratio [OR] = 2.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.56-5.03) than individual SVD markers (e.g., white matter hypoattenuation score, MTT, OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.09-2.04). Baseline blood pressure did not differ by presence or absence of hypoperfusion or across strata of SVD score. Presence of white matter hypoperfusion increased with SVD summed score. CONCLUSIONS: The SVD summed score was associated with hypoperfusion more consistently than individual SVD features, providing validity to the SVD score concept. Increasing SVD burden indicates worse perfusion in the white matter.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28314624,N,no brain data,,,

To this end, we tested if fMRI fluctuations in amygdala functional connectivity (FC) can be related to task-induced changes in physiological arousal and vigilance, as reflected in the skin conductance level (SCL). Thirty-two healthy individuals participated in the study. For the sliding-window analysis we used windows that were shifted by one volume at a time. Amygdala FC was calculated for each of these windows. Simultaneously acquired SCL time series were averaged over time frames that corresponded to the sliding-window FC analysis, which were subsequently regressed against the whole-brain seed-based amygdala sliding-window FC using the GLM. Surrogate time series were generated to test whether connectivity dynamics could have occurred by chance. In addition, results were contrasted against static amygdala FC and sliding-window FC of the primary visual cortex, which was chosen as a control seed, while a physio-physiological interaction (PPI) was performed as cross-validation. During periods of increased SCL, the left amygdala became more strongly coupled with the bilateral insula and anterior cingulate cortex, core areas of the salience network. The sliding-window analysis yielded a connectivity pattern that was unlikely to have occurred by chance, was spatially distinct from static amygdala FC and from sliding-window FC of the primary visual cortex, but was highly comparable to that of the PPI analysis. We conclude that sliding-window analysis can reveal functionally relevant fluctuations in connectivity in the context of an externally cued task.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28300639,N,no corr,,,

To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying these phenomena, we undertook a controlled cross-sectional study examining behavioral (Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia, PAINAD scores) and autonomic (heart rate, HR) pain responses in 24 HS and 20 AD subjects using acute pressure stimuli. Resting-state fMRI was utilized to investigate how group connectivity differences were related to altered pain responses. Pain behaviors (slope of PAINAD score change and mean PAINAD score) were increased in patients vs. CONTROLS: Autonomic measures (HR change intercept and mean HR change) were reduced in severe vs. mildly affected AD patients. Group functional connectivity differences associated with greater pain behavior reactivity in patients included: connectivity within a temporal limbic network (TLN) and between the TLN and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC); between default mode network (DMN) subcomponents; between the DMN and ventral salience network (vSN). Reduced HR responses within the AD group were associated with connectivity changes within the DMN and vSN-specifically the precuneus and vmPFC.

Evidences of physiological and molecular phenomena involved in this process are discussed and compared to reported literature. METHOD: Six fully healthy male non-smokers volunteered in this study. All volunteers were right handed, and have an equilibrated, consistent and healthy daily nutritional habit, and a healthy lifestyle. Participants were allowed consuming food during evening and night time while fasting with self-prohibiting food and liquids during 14 hours/day from sunrise to sunset. All participants underwent identical brain BOLD-fMRI protocol. The images were acquired in the Department of Radiology and Clinical Imaging of the University Hospital of Fez, Fez, Morocco. The anatomical brain and BOLD-fMRIs were acquired using a 1.5-Tesla scanner (Signa, General Electric, Milwaukee, United States). BOLD-fMRI image acquisition was done using single-shot gradient echo echo-planer imaging sequence. BOLD-fMRI paradigm consisted of the motor task where volunteers were asked to perform finger taping of the right hand. Two BOLD-fMRI scan sessions were performed, the first one between the 5th and 10th days preceding the start of fasting and the second between days 25th and 28th of the fasting month. All sessions were performed between 3:30 PM and 5:30 PM. Although individual maps were originated from different individual participants, they cover the same anatomic area in each case. Image processing and statistical analysis were conducted with Statistical Parameter Mapping version 8 (2008, Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London UK). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The maximal BOLD signal changes were calculated for each subject in the motor area M1; Activation maps were calculated and overlaid on the anatomical images. Group analysis of the data was performed, and the average volume and the maximum intensity of BOLD signal in the activated area M1 was determined for all studied volunteers. The current study allowed measuring regional brain volumes and neural network activity before and during an extended period of fasting using BOLD-fMRI. This demonstrated and confirmed the impact of fasting on human brain structure and function.

However, no previous study has assessed the relationship between these markers of central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction in AD participants and their potential joint effects on relapse risk. Forty early abstinent, treatment engaged AD patients underwent a laboratory experiment with exposure to neutral, alcohol and stress cues and a separate functional magnetic resonance imaging scan with similar cue exposure. Neutral-relaxed state cort:ACTH ratio was significantly associated with VmPFC hyperreactivity to neutral-relaxing cues, and also with hypoactivation in response to alcohol and stress cues in AD patients. Basal heart rate, neutral cort:ACTH ratio and neutral VmPFC hyperreactivty were each associated with risk of relapse. However, abnormal VmPFC activation and elevated cort:ACTH ratio overlap in predicting risk for relapse, and dysfunctional VmPFC response was the sole significant predictor of odds of relapse in a joint model of relapse risk.

Epub 2017 May 4.","Exteroceptive bodily signals (including tactile, proprioceptive and visual signals) are important information contributing to self-consciousness. Moreover, prominent theories proposed that visceral signals about internal bodily states are equally or even more important for self-consciousness. Neuroimaging studies have described several brain regions which process signals related to bodily self-consciousness (BSC) based on the integration of exteroceptive signals (e.g. premotor cortex, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and extrastriate body area), and that another brain region, the insula/operculum which is involved in interoception and interoceptive awareness, processes signals critical for self-awareness. Providing evidence for the integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive bodily signals, recent behavioral experiments have demonstrated that the manipulation of interoceptive (e.g. cardiac) signals, coupled with exteroceptive (e.g. visual) signals, also modulates BSC. Does this integration occur within or outside the structures described above? To this end, we adapted a recently designed protocol that uses cardio-visual stimulation to induce altered states of BSC to fMRI. Additionally, we measured neural activity in a classical interoceptive task. We found six brain regions (bilateral Rolandic operculum, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, right frontal inferior operculum and left temporal superior gyrus) that were activated differently during the interoception task as opposed to a control task. The brain regions which showed the highest selectivity for BSC based on our cardio-visual manipulation were found in the bilateral Rolandic operculum. Given our findings, we propose that the Rolandic operculum processes integrated exteroceptive-interoceptive signals that are necessary for interoceptive awareness as well as BSC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28370498,N,no corr,,,

In this study we investigated the relationship between CVD risk and arterial inflammation ((18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging), vascular calcification metabolism (Na(18)F PET/CT imaging), and vascular calcium burden (CT imaging) of the thoracic aorta in a population at low CVD risk. METHODS: Study participants underwent blood pressure measurements, blood analyses, and (18)F-FDG and Na(18)F PET/CT imaging. In addition, the 10-year risk for development of CVD, based on the Framingham risk score (FRS), was estimated. CVD risk was compared across quartiles of thoracic aorta (18)F-FDG uptake, Na(18)F uptake, and calcium burden on CT. RESULTS: A total of 139 subjects (52 % men, mean age 49 years, age range 21 - 75 years, median FRS 6 %) were evaluated. CVD risk was, on average, 3.7 times higher among subjects with thoracic aorta Na(18)F uptake in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile of the distribution (15.5 % vs. 4.2 %; P < 0.001).

Epub 2017 Apr 13.","Patients with anxiety disorders often experience a relapse in symptoms after exposure therapy. Similarly, threat responses acquired during Pavlovian threat conditioning often return after extinction learning. Accordingly, there is a need for alternative methods to persistently reduce threat responding. Studies in rodents have suggested that exercising behavioral control over an aversive stimulus can persistently diminish threat responses, and that these effects are mediated by the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and striatum. In this fMRI study, we attempted to translate these findings to humans. Subjects first underwent threat conditioning. We then contrasted two forms of safety learning: active avoidance, in which participants could prevent the shock through an action, and yoked extinction, with shock presentation matched to the active condition, but without instrumental control. The following day, we assessed subjects' threat responses (measured by skin conductance) to the conditioned stimuli without shock. Subjects next underwent threat conditioning with novel stimuli. Yoked extinction subjects showed an increase in conditioned response to stimuli from the previous day, but the active avoidance group did not. Additionally, active avoidance subjects showed reduced conditioned responding during novel threat conditioning, but the extinction group did not. We observed between-group differences in striatal BOLD responses to shock omission in Avoidance/Extinction. These findings suggest a differential role for the striatum in human active avoidance versus extinction learning, and indicate that active avoidance may be more effective than extinction in persistently diminishing threat responses.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Extinguished threat responses often reemerge with time, highlighting the importance of identifying more enduring means of attenuation. We compared the effects of active avoidance learning and yoked extinction on threat responses in humans and contrasted the neural circuitry engaged by these two processes. Subjects who learned to prevent a shock through an action maintained low threat responses after safety learning and showed attenuated threat conditioning with novel stimuli, in contrast to those who underwent yoked extinction. The results suggest that experiences of active control over threat engage the striatum and promote a shift from expression of innate defensive responses toward more adaptive behavioral responses to threatening stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28408411,N,no corr,,,

This suggests that interplay between the autonomic nervous system and aspects of the central nervous system subserving attention may be disrupted in these conditions. Better understanding these interactions and their relationship with individual variation in attentional behaviors could facilitate development of mechanistic biomarkers. We identified brain regions defined by trait-sensitive central-autonomic coupling as a first step in this process. As spontaneous neural activity measured during the resting state is sensitive to phenotypic variability, unconfounded by task performance, we examined whether spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity and an autonomic measure, pupil diameter, were coupled during the resting state, and whether that coupling predicted individual differences in attentional behavior. By employing concurrent pupillometry and fMRI during the resting state, we observed positive coupling in regions comprising cingulo-opercular, default mode, and fronto-parietal networks, as well as negative coupling with visual and sensorimotor regions. Individuals less prone to distractibility in everyday behavior demonstrated stronger positive coupling in cingulo-opercular regions often associated with sympathetic activity. Overall, our results suggest that individuals less prone to distractibility have tighter intrinsic coordination between specific brain areas and autonomic systems, which may enable adaptive autonomic shifts in response to salient environmental cues. These results suggest that incorporating autonomic indices in resting-state studies should be useful in the search for biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27712047,Y,corr,uns,,

The implementation of such fight-or-flight decisions is a central aspect in the genesis and evolution of aggression episodes, yet it is usually investigated only indirectly or in nonsocial situations. In the present fMRI study, we aimed to distinguish brain regions associated with aggressive and avoidant responses to interpersonal provocation in humans. Participants (thirty-six healthy young women) could either avoid or face a highly (HP) and a lowly (LP) provoking opponent in a competitive reaction time task: the fight-or-escape (FOE) paradigm. Subjects avoided the HP more often, but retaliated when facing her. Moreover, they chose to fight the HP more quickly, and showed increased heart rate (HR) right before confronting her. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and sensorimotor cortex were more active when participants decided to fight, whereas the mentalizing network was engaged when deciding to avoid. Importantly, avoiding the HP relative to the LP was associated with both higher activation in the right basolateral amygdala and lower relative activity in several mentalizing regions [e.g., medial and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)]. These results suggest that avoidant responses to provocation might result from heightened threat anticipation and are associated with reduced perspective taking.

Later, participants imitated these vowels and an untrained vowel pair during separate fMRI and rtMRI runs. Univariate fMRI analyses revealed that regions including left inferior frontal gyrus were more active during sensorimotor transformation (ST) and production of nonnative vowels, compared with native vowels; further, ST for nonnative vowels activated somatomotor cortex bilaterally, compared with ST of native vowels. Using test representational similarity analysis (RSA) models constructed from participants' vocal tract images and from stimulus formant distances, we found that RSA searchlight analyses of fMRI data showed either type of model could be represented in somatomotor, temporal, cerebellar, and hippocampal neural activation patterns during ST.

Furthermore, using seed-based approach, greater interoceptive accuracy was associated with greater intrinsic connectivity of all insular functional subdivisions to salience network regions, including the anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum and midbrain. These associations remained after correcting for voxel-wise grey matter volumes. The findings underscore the critical role of insular salience network intrinsic connectivity in interoceptive awareness and pave the way for future investigations into how salience network dysconnectivity affects interoceptive awareness in brain disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27573028,N,no phys of interest,,,
Altered Cerebellar Activity in Visceral Pain-Related Fear Conditioning in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Cerebellum,"Claassen, J,Labrenz, F,Ernst, T M,Icenhour, A,Langhorst, J,Forsting, M,Timmann, D,Elsenbruch, S,eng,Cerebellum. 2017 Apr;16(2):508-517. doi: 10.1007/s12311-016-0832-7.","There is evidence to support a role of the cerebellum in emotional learning processes, which are demonstrably altered in patients with chronic pain. We tested if cerebellar activation is altered during visceral pain-related fear conditioning and extinction in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Cerebellar blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) data from N = 17 IBS patients and N = 21 healthy controls, collected as part of a previous fMRI study, was reanalyzed utilizing an advanced normalizing method of the cerebellum. The differential fear conditioning paradigm consisted of acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement phases. During acquisition, two visual conditioned stimuli (CS) were presented either paired (CS+) or unpaired (CS-) with painful rectal distension as unconditioned stimulus (US). In the extinction phase, the CS+ and CS- were presented without US. For reinstatement, unpaired US presentations were followed by unpaired CS+ and CS- presentations. Group differences in cerebellar activation were analyzed for the contrasts CS+ > CS- and CS- > CS+. During acquisition, IBS patients revealed significantly enhanced cerebellar BOLD responses to pain-predictive (CS+) and safety (CS-) cues compared to controls (p < 0.05, family-wise error corrected). Increased activation was found in three main clusters, including the vermis (maximum in vermal lobule VI), intermediate cerebellum (maximum in lobule VIII), and the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere (maximum in lobule VI). Areas overlapped for the contrasts CS+ > CS- and CS- > CS+. Group differences were most prominent in the contrast CS- > CS+. During extinction and reinstatement, no significant group differences were found. During visceral pain-related fear conditioning, IBS patients showed increased activations in circumscribed areas of the medial, intermediate, and lateral cerebellum. These areas are involved in autonomic, somatosensory, and cognitive functions and likely contribute to the different aspects of pain-related fear. The cerebellum contributes to altered pain-related fear learning in IBS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27797090,N,no corr,,,

The aim of the present study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationship of oral LSD. METHODS: We analyzed pharmacokinetic data from two published placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies using oral administration of LSD 100 and 200 microg in 24 and 16 subjects, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of the 100-microg dose is shown for the first time and data for the 200-microg dose were reanalyzed and included. Plasma concentrations of LSD, subjective effects, and vital signs were repeatedly assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. RESULTS: Geometric mean (95% confidence interval) maximum plasma concentration values of 1.3 (1.2-1.9) and 3.1 (2.6-4.0) ng/mL were reached 1.4 and 1.5 h after administration of 100 and 200 microg LSD, respectively. The plasma half-life was 2.6 h (2.2-3.4 h). The subjective effects lasted (mean +/- standard deviation) 8.2 +/- 2.1 and 11.6 +/- 1.7 h for the 100- and 200-microg LSD doses, respectively. Subjective peak effects were reached 2.8 and 2.5 h after administration of LSD 100 and 200 microg, respectively. A close relationship was observed between the LSD concentration and subjective response within subjects, with moderate counterclockwise hysteresis. Half-maximal effective concentration values were in the range of 1 ng/mL. No correlations were found between plasma LSD concentrations and the effects of LSD across subjects at or near maximum plasma concentration and within dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present pharmacokinetic data are important for the evaluation of clinical study findings (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging studies) and the interpretation of LSD intoxication. Oral LSD presented dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination up to 12 h. The effects of LSD were related to changes in plasma concentrations over time, with no evidence of acute tolerance.

It remains unknown how these multiple network components interact, and it remains unknown how they cause the behavioral, autonomic, and experiential effects of emotions. Here we describe a framework for combining a novel technique, concurrent electrical stimulation with fMRI (es-fMRI), together with a novel analysis, inferring causal structure from fMRI data (causal discovery). We outline a research program for investigating human emotion with these new tools, and provide initial findings from two large resting-state datasets as well as case studies in neurosurgical patients with electrical stimulation of the amygdala. The overarching goal is to use causal discovery methods on fMRI data to infer causal graphical models of how brain regions interact, and then to further constrain these models with direct stimulation of specific brain regions and concurrent fMRI. We conclude by discussing limitations and future extensions. The approach could yield anatomical hypotheses about brain connectivity, motivate rational strategies for treating mood disorders with deep brain stimulation, and could be extended to animal studies that use combined optogenetic fMRI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146466,N,no phys of interest,,,

Additionally, the constituents of a number of brain subnetworks, and in particular of the central autonomic network (CAN), are still not completely determined. In this study we present and validate a global conditioning approach to reconstructing directed networks using complex synthetic networks of nonlinear oscillators. We then employ our framework, along with a probabilistic model for heartbeat generation, to characterize the directed functional connectome of the human brain and to establish which parts of this connectome effect the directed central modulation of peripheral autonomic cardiovascular control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our conditioning approach and unveil a top-down directed influence of the default mode network on the salience network, which in turn is seen to be the strongest modulator of directed autonomic cardiovascular control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29060864,N,ICA,,,

Previous imaging studies have used subsequent memory paradigms to probe hippocampal function in e4 carriers across the age range, and evidence suggests a pattern of hippocampal overactivation in young adult e4 carriers. METHODS: In this study, we employed a word-based subsequent memory task under fMRI; pupillometry data were also acquired as an index of cognitive effort. Participants (26 non-e4 carriers and 28 e4 carriers) performed an incidental encoding task (presented as word categorization), followed by a surprise old/new recognition task after a 40 minute delay. RESULTS: In e4 carriers only, subsequently remembered words were linked to increased hippocampal activity. Across all participants, increased pupil diameter differentiated subsequently remembered from forgotten words, and neural activity covaried with pupil diameter in cuneus and precuneus. These effects were weaker in e4 carriers, and e4 carriers did not show greater pupil diameter to remembered words. In the recognition phase, genotype status also modulated hippocampal activity: here, however, e4 carriers failed to show the conventional pattern of greater hippocampal activity to novel words. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, neural activity changes were unstable in e4 carriers, failed to respond to novelty, and did not link strongly to cognitive effort, as indexed by pupil diameter. This provides further evidence of abnormal hippocampal recruitment in young adult e4 carriers, manifesting as both up and downregulation of neural activity, in the absence of behavioral performance differences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28239522,Y,corr,uns,,
Cardiorespiratory concerns shape brain responses during automatic panic-related scene processing in patients with panic disorder,J Psychiatry Neurosci,"Feldker, Katharina,Heitmann, Carina Yvonne,Neumeister, Paula,Brinkmann, Leonie,Bruchmann, Maximillan,Zwitserlood, Pienie,Straube, Thomas,eng,Canada,J Psychiatry Neurosci. 2017 Nov;42(6):160226. doi: 10.1503/jpn.160226. Epub 2017 Sep 26.","BACKGROUND: Increased automatic processing of threat-related stimuli has been proposed as a key element in panic disorder. Little is known about the neural basis of automatic processing, in particular to task-irrelevant, panic-related, ecologically valid stimuli, or about the association between brain activation and symptomatology in patients with panic disorder. METHODS: The present event-related fMRI study compared brain responses to task-irrelevant, panic-related and neutral visual stimuli in medication-free patients with panic disorder and healthy controls. Panic-related and neutral scenes were presented while participants performed a spatially nonoverlapping bar orientation task. Correlation analyses investigated the association between brain responses and panic-related aspects of symptomatology, measured using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI). RESULTS: We included 26 patients with panic disorder and 26 heatlhy controls in our analysis. Compared with controls, patients with panic disorder showed elevated activation in the amygdala, brainstem, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex and midcingulate cortex in response to panic-related versus neutral task-irrelevant stimuli. Furthermore, fear of cardiovascular symptoms (a subcomponent of the ASI) was associated with insula activation, whereas fear of respiratory symptoms was associated with brainstem hyperactivation in patients with panic disorder. LIMITATIONS: The additional implementation of measures of autonomic activation, such as pupil diameter, heart rate, or electrodermal activity, would have been informative during the fMRI scan as well as during the rating procedure. CONCLUSION: Results reveal a neural network involved in the processing of panic-related distractor stimuli in patients with panic disorder and suggest an automatic weighting of panic-related information depending on the magnitude of cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms.

Previous lesion and neuroimaging studies have identified a network of regions recruited during word reading, including ventral occipital-temporal regions and the angular gyrus (AG). However, there is still debate about what information is being represented and processed in these regions. This study has two aims. The first is to help adjudicate between competing hypotheses concerning the role of ventral occipital cortex in reading. The second is to adjudicate between competing hypotheses concerning the role of the AG in reading. Participants read words in the scanner while performing a proper name detection task and we use a multivariate pattern analysis technique for analyzing fMRI data - representational similarity analysis (RSA) - to decode the type of information being represented in these regions based on computationally explicit theories. Distributed patterns of activation in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) and the AG show evidence of some type of orthographic processing, while the right hemisphere homologues of the vOT supports visual, but not orthographic, information processing of letter strings. In addition, there is evidence of left-lateralized semantic processing in the lvOT and evidence of top-down feedback in the lvOT. Taken together, these results suggest an interactive activation theory of visual word processing in which both the lvOT and lAG are neural loci of an orthographic level of representations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28384482,N,no phys of interest,,,

Previous neuroimaging studies have shown a relationship between reading recovery and increases in contralesional and perilesional activation during word reading tasks, relative to controls. Questions remain about how to interpret these changes in activation. Do these changes reflect functional take-over, a reorganization of functions in the damaged brain? Or do they reveal compensatory masquerade or the use of alternative neural pathways to reading that are available in both patients and controls? We address these questions by studying a single individual, CH, who has made a partial recovery of reading familiar words following stroke. We use an fMRI analysis technique, representational similarity analysis (RSA), which allows us to decode cognitive function from distributed patterns of neural activity. Relative to controls, we find that CH shows a shift from visual to orthographic processing in contralesional regions, with a marginally significant result in perilesional regions as well. This pattern supports a contralesional reorganization of orthographic processing following stroke. More generally, these analyses demonstrate how powerful RSA can be for mapping the neural plasticity of language function.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270937,N,clinical,,,

Recently, a non-invasive approach to vagal stimulation has demonstrated similar beneficial effects, but it remains unclear whether these effects are mediated via activation of afferent vagal fibers. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to ascertain whether afferent vagal projections can be accessed non-invasively by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the antero-lateral surface of the neck, which overlies the course of the vagus nerve. METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects underwent 2 fMRI scans in one session. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation was applied for 2 min to the right postero-lateral surface of the neck during scan #1 (control condition, sternocleidomastoid stimulation: ""SCM"") and to the right antero-lateral surface of the neck during scan #2 (experimental condition, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation: ""nVNS""). Two analyses were conducted using FSL (whole-brain and brainstem; corrected, p < 0.01) to determine whether nVNS activated vagal projections in the brainstem and forebrain, compared to baseline and SCM stimulation. RESULTS: Compared to baseline and control (SCM) stimulation, nVNS significantly activated primary vagal projections including: nucleus of the solitary tract (primary central relay of vagal afferents), parabrachial area, primary sensory cortex, and insula. Regions of the basal ganglia and frontal cortex were also significantly activated. Deactivations were found in the hippocampus, visual cortex, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. CONCLUSION: The present findings provide evidence in humans that cervical vagal afferents can be accessed non-invasively via transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the antero-lateral surface of the neck, which overlies the course of the nerve, suggesting an alternative and feasible method of stimulating vagal afferents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28104084,N,no phys of interest,,,

Stage 1 involved conditioning and extinction, and stage 2 involved extinction recall, re-conditioning, followed by re-extinction. During extinction recall, we observed a higher skin conductance response to the CS+ relative to CS- in adolescents compared to adults, which was accompanied by a reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity.

Age differences in PCC activation between late extinction and late conditioning were also observed. These results show for the first time that healthy adolescent humans show different behavioral responses, and dampened PFC activity during short-term extinction recall compared to healthy adults. We also identify the PCC and TPJ as novel regions that may be associated with impaired extinction in adolescents.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of respiratory-gated auricular vagal afferent nerve stimulation (RAVANS), a novel neuromodulatory intervention based on an existing transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation approach, in the modulation of brainstem activity and connectivity in migraine patients. We applied 3T-functional magnetic resonance imaging with improved in-plane spatial resolution (2.62 x 2.62 mm) in episodic migraine (interictal) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls to evaluate brain response to RAVANS (gated to either inhalation or exhalation) and sham stimulation. We further investigated RAVANS modulation of tactile trigeminal sensory afference response in the brainstem using air-puff stimulation directed to the forehead during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with sham and inhalatory-gated RAVANS (iRAVANS), exhalatory-gated RAVANS (eRAVANS) activated an ipsilateral pontomedullary region consistent with nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). During eRAVANS, NTS connectivity was increased to anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex, compared with both sham and iRAVANS, in migraine patients. Increased connectivity was inversely correlated with relative time to the next migraine attack, suggesting clinical relevance to this change in connectivity. Poststimulation effects were also noted immediately after eRAVANS, as we found increased activation in putative pontine serotonergic (ie, nucleus raphe centralis) and noradrenergic (ie, locus coeruleus) nuclei in response to trigeminal sensory afference. Regulation of activity and connectivity of brainstem and cortical regions involved in serotonergic and noradrenergic regulation and pain modulation may constitute an underlying mechanism supporting beneficial clinical outcomes for eRAVANS applied for episodic migraine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28541256,N,no phys of interest,,,

The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale). Discussion Embolic stroke of undetermined source is caused by embolic disease and associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and clinically silent cerebral ischemic lesions. ATTICUS will investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation detected by insertable cardiac monitor and the effects of early anticoagulation with apixaban compared with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid on the incidence of new ischemic lesion after embolic stroke of undetermined source.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881833,N,no phys of interest,,,

Uptake in adipose tissue occurs in up to half of pediatric oncology patients undergoing PET scans, and is especially common in adolescents. adipose tissue is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, and beta blockers such as propranolol have shown efficacy in reducing adipose tissue uptake on PET scans done in older adult oncology patients. PARTICIPANTS: Because propranolol may cause hypoglycemia or other side effects in fasting patients, we prospectively assessed the safety of a single dose of 20 mg propranolol in adolescent and young adult oncology patients undergoing FDG-PET imaging. METHODS: Ten patients (median age 18 years, range 14-24) received propranolol premedication prior to FDG-PET. RESULTS: No adverse effects or clinically significant changes in serum glucose, heart rate, or blood pressure were observed. Five of the 10 patients had adipose tissue identified on previous PET scans. However, following propranolol administration only, one patient had persistent uptake in adipose tissue.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a probabilistic heat pain paradigm, we investigated which computations underlie pain perception.

Although neuroimaging studies, in general, and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI), in particular, have provided relevant information regarding such alterations, rs-fMRI studies have been typically limited to the analysis of between-region functional connectivity alterations at low-frequency signal fluctuations (i.e., <0.08 Hz). Conversely, the local attributes of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal across different frequency bands have been seldom studied, although they may provide valuable information. Here, we evaluated local alterations in low-frequency fluctuations across different oscillation bands in OCD. Sixty-five OCD patients and 50 healthy controls underwent an rs-fMRI assessment. Alterations in the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) were evaluated, voxel-wise, across four different bands (from 0.01 Hz to 0.25 Hz). OCD patients showed decreased fALFF values in medial orbitofrontal regions and increased fALFF values in the dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) at frequency bands <0.08 Hz. This pattern was reversed at higher frequencies, where increased fALFF values also appeared in medial temporal lobe structures and medial thalamus. Clinical variables (i.e., symptom-specific severities) were associated with fALFF values across the different frequency bands. Our findings provide novel evidence about the nature and regional distribution of functional alterations in OCD, which should contribute to refine neurobiological models of the disorder. We suggest that the evaluation of the local attributes of BOLD signal across different frequency bands may be a sensitive approach to further characterize brain functional alterations in psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27771857,N,no phys of interest,,,

While these effects have become better understood in recent years, the impact that their correction has on the quality of rs-fMRI measurements has yet to be clarified. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of correcting for CRV, RVT and PETCO2 on the rs-fMRI measurements. Nine healthy subjects underwent a test-retest rs-fMRI acquisition using repetition times (TRs) of 2 s (long-TR) and 0.323 s (short-TR), and the data were processed using eight different physiological correction strategies. Subsequently, regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and resting-state connectivity of the motor and default-mode networks are calculated for each strategy. Reproducibility is calculated using intra-class correlation and the Dice Coefficient, while the accuracy of functional-connectivity measures is assessed through network separability, sensitivity and specificity. We found that: (1) the reproducibility of the rs-fMRI measures improved significantly after correction for PETCO2; (2) separability of functional networks increased after PETCO2 correction but was not affected by RVT and CRV correction; (3) the effect of physiological correction does not depend on the data sampling-rate; (4) the effect of physiological processes and correction strategies is network-specific. Our findings highlight limitations in our understanding of rs-fMRI quality measures, and underscore the importance of using multiple quality measures to determine the optimal physiological correction strategy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29051724,N,no phys of interest,,,

Whereas amisulpride left sexual functions and neural activations unimpaired, we observed detrimental activations under reboxetine within the caudate nucleus corresponding to motivational components of sexual behavior. However, broadly impaired subjective sexual functioning under reboxetine suggested effects on further neural components. We now investigated the same sample under these two agents with static erotic picture stimulation as alternative stimulus presentation mode to potentially observe further neural treatment effects of reboxetine. 19 healthy males were investigated under reboxetine, amisulpride and placebo for 7 days each within a double-blind cross-over design. During fMRI static erotic picture were presented with preceding anticipation periods. Subjective sexual functions were assessed by a self-reported questionnaire. Neural activations were attenuated within the caudate nucleus, putamen, ventral striatum, the pregenual and anterior midcingulate cortex and in the orbitofrontal cortex under reboxetine. Subjective diminished sexual arousal under reboxetine was correlated with attenuated neural reactivity within the posterior insula. Again, amisulpride left neural activations along with subjective sexual functioning unimpaired. Neither reboxetine nor amisulpride altered differential neural activations during anticipation of erotic stimuli. Our results verified detrimental effects of noradrenergic agents on neural motivational but also emotional and autonomic components of sexual behavior.

Hence, we aimed to study brain response of male IBS patients following rectal balloon distension as compared to healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Data between diarrhea and constipation predominant IBS (IBS-D and IBS-C) were also compared. Methods: Rectal balloon distension threshold was assessed in 20 male IBS patients (10 IBS-C and 10 IBS-D) and 10 age-matched male healthy controls. Subsequently, fMRI on all the participants was performed at their respective rectal pain threshold. The fMRI data were analysed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software. Results: IBS patients showed greater cerebral activations in insula, middle temporal gyrus, and cerebellum in the left hemisphere compared to healthy controls. Neural activation was found in bilateral precuneus/superior parietal lobules in controls but not in patients with IBS. The brain activation differed among IBS-C and IBS-D patients; while the right mid-cingulate cortex was activated in IBS-C, the left inferior orbito-frontal cortex, left calcarine, and bilateral fusiform gyri were activated among patients with IBS-D following rectal balloon distension.

However, the acute effects of spontaneous breathing with TT versus PSV on autonomic function assessed through heart rate variability (HRV) have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of spontaneous breathing in TT vs PSV in critically ill patients. METHOD: Twenty-one patients who had received MV for >/= 48 h and who met the study inclusion criteria for weaning were assessed. Eligible patients were randomized to TT and PSV. Cardiorespiratory responses (respiratory rate -f, tidal volume-VT , mean blood pressure (MBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), end tidal dioxide carbone (PET CO2 ), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and HRV indices in frequency domain (low-LF, high frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio were evaluated. RESULTS: TT increased f (20 +/- 5 vs 25 +/- 4 breaths/min, P<0.05), MBP (90 +/- 14 vs 94 +/- 18 mmHg, P<0.05), HR (90 +/- 17 vs 96 +/- 12 beats/min, P<0.05), PET CO2 (33 +/- 8 vs 48 +/- 10 mmHg, P<0.05) and reduced SpO2 (98 +/- 1.6 vs 96 +/- 1.6%, P<0.05). In addition, LF increased (47 +/- 18 vs 38 +/- 12 nu, P<0.05) and HF reduced (29 +/- 13 vs 32 +/- 16 nu, P<0.05), resulting in higher LF/HF ratio (1.62 +/- 2 vs 1.18 +/- 1, P<0.05) during TT. Conversely, VT increased with PSV (0.58 +/- 0.16 vs 0.50 +/- 0.15 L, P<0.05) compared with TT.

However, evidence is lacking regarding the role of intermittent fasting. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a Ramadan model of intermittent fasting (RIF; 14 h of daytime abstinence from food and drinking) for 28 d on body composition, glucose metabolism, and cognitive function. METHODS: Ten healthy, lean men were included in a nonrandomized, crossover, intervention study. Testing was performed before a control period of 28 d, as well as before and after 28 d of RIF. Whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, fitness test, oral glucose tolerance test, and cognitive function tests were performed. As secondary outcome, the participants' physical activity and 72-h glycemic responses were monitored 6 d within each of the periods. Dietary intake, appetite, and mood questionnaires also were assessed. RESULTS: Comparing Delta differences from testing days; body mass index changes from the control period (Delta mean: 0.2 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval [CI], -2 to 0.5) and the RIF period (Delta mean: -0.3 kg/m(2), 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1) were significantly different (P < 0.05). Secondary outcomes within the RIF period showed an increased area under curve (AUC) for hunger accompanied by a reduced AUC for satiety (both, P < 0.05), less mean steps per day (P < 0.05), and less positive feelings in the afternoon (P < 0.01) compared with the control period. No changes were observed in any of the other evaluated parameters.

Although decreased physical activity and enhanced intake of high-caloric foods are important risk factors for developing obesity, human behavior during eating also plays a role. Previous studies have shown that distraction while eating increases food intake and leads to impaired processing of food stimuli. As olfaction is the most important sense involved in flavor perception, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to investigate the influence of cognitive memory load on olfactory perception and processing. Low- and high-caloric food odors were presented in combination with either low or high cognitive loads utilizing a memory task. The efficacy of the memory task was verified by a decrease in participant recall accuracy and an increase in skin conductance response during high cognitive load. Our behavioral data reveal a diminished perceived intensity for low- but not high-caloric food odors during high cognitive load. For low-caloric food odors, bilateral orbitofrontal (OFC) and piriform cortices (pirC) showed significantly lower activity during high compared with low cognitive load. For high-caloric food odors, a similar effect was established in pirC, but not in OFC. Insula activity correlates with higher intensity ratings found during the low cognitive load condition. We conclude lower activity in pirC and OFC to be responsible for diminished intensity perception, comparable to results in olfactory impaired patients and elderly. Further studies should investigate the influence of olfactory/gustatory intensities on food choices under distraction with special regards to low-caloric food.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28968851,N,no phys of interest,,,

Antipsychotics are dopamine D2 receptor antagonists and are the standard of medical care in schizophrenia, but the drugs are associated with severe metabolic side effects such as obesity and diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are registered for treatment of both obesity and type 2 diabetes. We investigated metabolic effects of the GLP-1RA, exenatide once-weekly, in non-diabetic, antipsychotic-treated, obese patients with schizophrenia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antipsychotic-treated, obese, non-diabetic, schizophrenia spectrum patients were randomized to double-blinded adjunctive treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous exenatide (n = 23) or placebo (n = 22) injections for 3 months. The primary outcome was loss of body weight after treatment and repeated measures analysis of variance was used as statistical analysis. RESULTS: Between March 2013 and June 2015, 40 patients completed the trial. At baseline, mean body weight was 118.3 +/- 16.0 kg in the exenatide group and 111.7 +/- 18.0 kg in the placebo group, with no group differences ( P = .23). The exenatide and placebo groups experienced significant ( P = .004), however similar ( P = .98), weight losses of 2.24 +/- 3.3 and 2.23 +/- 4.4 kg, respectively, after 3 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with exenatide once-weekly did not promote weight loss in obese, antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia compared to placebo. Our results could suggest that the body weight-lowering effect of GLP-1RAs involves dopaminergic signaling, but blockade of other receptor systems may also play a role. Nevertheless, anti-obesity regimens effective in the general population may not be readily implemented in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27717222,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, physiological noise correction has not emerged as a standard preprocessing step for fMRI data yet due to: (1) the varying data quality of physiological recordings, (2) non-standardized peripheral data formats and (3) the lack of full automatization of processing and modeling physiology, required for large-cohort studies. NEW METHODS: We introduce the PhysIO Toolbox for preprocessing of physiological recordings and model-based noise correction. It implements a variety of noise models, such as RETROICOR, respiratory volume per time and heart rate variability responses (RVT/HRV). The toolbox covers all intermediate steps - from flexible read-in of data formats to GLM regressor/contrast creation - without any manual intervention. RESULTS: We demonstrate the workflow of the toolbox and its functionality for datasets from different vendors, recording devices, field strengths and subject populations. Automatization of physiological noise correction and performance evaluation are reported in a group study (N=35). COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The PhysIO Toolbox reproduces physiological noise patterns and correction efficacy of previously implemented noise models. It increases modeling robustness by outperforming vendor-provided peak detection methods for physiological cycles. Finally, the toolbox offers an integrated framework with full automatization, including performance monitoring, and flexibility with respect to the input data.

While it is often assumed that the amount of exertion invested in a task can be voluntarily regulated, the neural bases of such faculty and its behavioural effects are yet insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated how the instructions to execute a demanding cognitive task either ""with maximum exertion"" or ""as relaxed as possible"" affected performance and brain activity. The maximum exertion condition, compared to relaxed execution, was associated with speeded motor responses without an accuracy trade-off, and an amplification of both task-related activations in dorsal frontoparietal and cerebellar regions, and task-related deactivations in default mode network (DMN) areas. Furthermore, the visual cue to engage maximum effort triggered an anticipatory widespread increase of activity in attentional, sensory and executive regions, with its peak in the brain stem reticular activating system. Across individuals, this surge of activity in the brain stem, but also in medial wall cortical regions projecting to the adrenal medulla, positively correlated with increases in heart rate, suggesting that the intention to willfully modulate invested effort involves mechanisms related to catecholaminergic transmission and a suppression of DMN activity in favor of externally-directed attentional processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222423,Y,corr,uns,,

Realistic models have many parameters, which in practice cannot be fitted using the limited amounts of brain-activity data typically available. Task performance optimization (e.g. using backpropagation to train neural networks) provides major constraints for fitting parameters and discovering nonlinear representational features appropriate for the task (e.g. object classification). Model representations can be compared to brain representations in terms of the representational dissimilarities they predict for an image set. This method, called representational similarity analysis (RSA), enables us to test the representational feature space as is (fixed RSA) or to fit a linear transformation that mixes the nonlinear model features so as to best explain a cortical area's representational space (mixed RSA). Like voxel/population-receptive-field modelling, mixed RSA uses a training set (different stimuli) to fit one weight per model feature and response channel (voxels here), so as to best predict the response profile across images for each response channel. We analysed response patterns elicited by natural images, which were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that early visual areas were best accounted for by shallow models, such as a Gabor wavelet pyramid (GWP). The GWP model performed similarly with and without mixing, suggesting that the original features already approximated the representational space, obviating the need for mixing. However, a higher ventral-stream visual representation (lateral occipital region) was best explained by the higher layers of a deep convolutional network and mixing of its feature set was essential for this model to explain the representation. We suspect that mixing was essential because the convolutional network had been trained to discriminate a set of 1000 categories, whose frequencies in the training set did not match their frequencies in natural experience or their behavioural importance. The latter factors might determine the representational prominence of semantic dimensions in higher-level ventral-stream areas. Our results demonstrate the benefits of testing both the specific representational hypothesis expressed by a model's original feature space and the hypothesis space generated by linear transformations of that feature space.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298702,N,no phys of interest,,,

Whether these alterations constitute a vulnerability or a symptom of illness remains unclear. The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) is thought to play a central role in estimating probability and cost of threat, in turn informing selection of subsequent behaviors. To better understand the behavioral and neural processes that may be associated with risk for psychopathology, we used a virtual reality paradigm to examine behavioral and neural responses of psychiatrically healthy adults with familial history of affective disorders during anticipation of unpredictable threat. METHODS: Twenty psychiatrically healthy adults with high familial risk for affective disorders and 20 low-risk matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging concurrent with a paradigm in which they explored virtual contexts associated with the threat of shock or safety from shock. Subjective anxiety ratings, skin conductance, exploratory behavior, and neural responses were examined for threat versus safe conditions. RESULTS: High-risk adults evidenced greater right mOFC activation, as well as greater BI, compared to low-risk adults. There were no significant group differences in subjective ratings or autonomic responses. Individuals exhibiting greater activity in the right mOFC showed greater BI and decreased skin conductance response. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that BI and mOFC recruitment during anticipation of aversive outcomes may reflect a vulnerability for affective disorders. However, such a response may also serve as a compensatory response, protecting these high-risk individuals from negative outcomes (i.e., increased physiological arousal). These results suggest that the OFC may play a central role in driving threat-related behaviors and thus may be a target for efforts aimed at early detection or prevention.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28828218,N,no corr,,,

For that purpose, the acute influence of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram (30 mg) and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (8 mg) was repeatedly measured in 12 healthy young volunteers with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). Eighteen RS-fMRI scans were acquired per subject during this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Within-group comparisons of voxelwise functional connectivity with 10 functional networks were examined (P < 0.05, FWE-corrected) using a non-parametric multivariate approach with cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, heart rate, and baseline measurements as covariates. Although both compounds did not change cognitive performance on several tests, significant effects were found on connectivity with multiple resting state networks. Serotonergic stimulation primarily reduced connectivity with the sensorimotor network and structures that are related to self-referential mechanisms, whereas galantamine affected networks and regions that are more involved in learning, memory, and visual perception and processing.

We introduce an analogous system for representing sensations from within the body, called interoception, and demonstrate its relation to regulating peripheral systems in the body, called allostasis. Employing the recently introduced Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model, we used tract-tracing studies of macaque monkeys, followed by two intrinsic functional magnetic resonance imaging samples (N = 280 and N = 270) to evaluate the existence of an intrinsic allostatic/interoceptive system in the human brain. Another sample (N = 41) allowed us to evaluate the convergent validity of the hypothesized allostatic/interoceptive system by showing that individuals with stronger connectivity between system hubs performed better on an implicit index of interoceptive ability related to autonomic fluctuations. Implications include insights for the brain's functional architecture, dissolving the artificial boundary between mind and body, and unifying mental and physical illness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28983518,N,no phys of interest,,,
Exercise-Induced Fitness Changes Correlate with Changes in Neural Specificity in Older Adults,Front Hum Neurosci,"Kleemeyer, Maike M,Polk, Thad A,Schaefer, Sabine,Bodammer, Nils C,Brechtel, Lars,Lindenberger, Ulman,eng,Switzerland,Front Hum Neurosci. 2017 Mar 16;11:123. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00123. eCollection 2017.","Neural specificity refers to the degree to which neural representations of different stimuli can be distinguished. Evidence suggests that neural specificity, operationally defined as stimulus-related differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns, declines with advancing adult age, and that individual differences in neural specificity are associated with individual differences in fluid intelligence. A growing body of literature also suggests that regular physical activity may help preserve cognitive abilities in old age. Based on this literature, we hypothesized that exercise-induced improvements in fitness would be associated with greater neural specificity among older adults. A total of 52 adults aged 59-74 years were randomly assigned to one of two aerobic-fitness training regimens, which differed in intensity. Participants in both groups trained three times a week on stationary bicycles. In the low-intensity (LI) group, the resistance was kept constant at a low level (10 Watts). In the high-intensity (HI) group, the resistance depended on participants' heart rate and therefore typically increased with increasing fitness. Before and after the 6-month training phase, participants took part in a functional MRI experiment in which they viewed pictures of faces and buildings. We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to estimate the distinctiveness of neural activation patterns in ventral visual cortex (VVC) evoked by face or building stimuli. Fitness was also assessed before and after training. In line with our hypothesis, training-induced changes in fitness were positively associated with changes in neural specificity. We conclude that physical activity may protect against age-related declines in neural specificity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360850,N,no phys of interest,,,

The pancreas is densely innervated by the vagus nerve, which mediates early meal-induced secretion of pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Early secretion after sham feeding has been validated as a marker of vagal integrity. Thus, the aim was to evaluate the ratio of increased PP plasma levels after sham feeding in PD and correlate findings with gastrointestinal transit time (GITT). METHODS: Twenty-five PD patients and 17 controls were included. PP, insulin, and blood glucose levels were measured before, during, and after sham feeding with white bread and chocolate spread. GITT was measured using radiopaque markers. Furthermore, faeces samples were analyzed for pancreatic elastase enzyme as a marker of exocrine pancreatic function. RESULTS: PD patients showed significantly lower PP ratio levels after sham feeding, which was most pronounced at 10 minutes. No significant association was seen between attenuated PP response and GITT in PD patients. No between-group differences were seen in glucose or insulin levels over time, but PD patients showed generally lower insulin levels compared to controls. No difference was found in faeces pancreatic elastase.

These patterns cannot be predicted from an individual's baseline physiological or psychological measures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the different muscle sympathetic responses to tonic muscle pain were associated with differential changes in regional brain activity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain was performed concurrently with microelectrode recording of MSNA from the peroneal nerve during a 40-min infusion of hypertonic saline into the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle. MSNA increased in 26 and decreased in 11 of 37 subjects during tonic muscle pain. Within the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, precuneus, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and dorsomedial hypothalamus, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity increased in the increasing-MSNA group and remained at baseline or decreased in the decreasing-MSNA group. Similar responses occurred in the dorsolateral pons and in the region of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. By contrast, within the region of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) signal intensity initially increased in both groups but returned to baseline levels only in the increasing-MSNA group. These results suggest that the divergent sympathetic responses to muscle pain result from activation of a neural pathway that includes the dlPAG, an area thought to be responsible for the behavioral and cardiovascular responses to psychological rather than physical stressors.

METHODS: The survey was performed according to the European Commission Dose DataMed (DDM) project methodology. 28 most frequent NM diagnostic procedures were identified. Data about frequencies of procedures and average administered activities of radioisotopes used in those procedures were collected. Average administered activities were converted to effective doses according to the dose conversion coefficients. Then the collective effective dose to the population and an effective dose per capita were calculated based on the number of the most frequent NM diagnostic procedures and the average effective dose per procedure. RESULTS: In 2010, 41200 NM diagnostic procedures led to 146.7 manSv collective effective dose to the population and in 2015, 42000 NM diagnostic procedures led to 146.8 manSv collective effective dose to the population. The frequencies of NM diagnostic procedures were 9.7 and 9.8 annually per 1000 population with 34.1 muSv and 34.2 muSv effective dose per capita for 2010 and 2015, respectively. The main contributors to the annual collective dose from NM in Croatia are examinations of the bone, heart, thyroid and PET/CT tumour diagnostic. Average administered activities have not changed considerably from 2010 to 2015. Nevertheless, within the frequency of some of the procedures, significant changes were found in five-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Frequencies, average administered activities and collective effective dose to the population from NM diagnostic procedures in Croatia are comparable to the values reported by other European surveys.

The aim of the study was to evaluate brain activation arising from anticipated extraspinal sensory pathways. METHODS: Fourteen patients ages 24-54 years were enrolled, all having experienced a complete SCI (ASIA A) at C7 to T5 an average of 17 months before study entry. Urodynamic equipment was used for repeated bladder filling and detrusor activity evaluation. All functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements were performed using a Siemens Trio 3T scanner with the GRE-EPI sequence (field of view = 192 x 192 mm, voxel 3 x 3 x 3 mm, TR/TE = 3000/30 ms, 45 slices). Nine hundred dynamic scans were acquired over 45 min. Statistical analysis was done in SPM8 using a general linear model. Statistics using t-tests were thresholded at P = 0.001. RESULTS: We excluded results from two patients because of activation artifacts. In 8 of 12 patients, significant brain activity was observed during urinary bladder filling. We found significant activation clusters at the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) (3/8), parabrachial nucleus (PBN) (4/8), hypothalamus (4/8), thalamus (6/8), amygdala (7/8), insular lobe (5/8), anterior cingulate gyrus (5/8), and prefrontal cortex (8/8). Activations in nuclei involved in afferents likely from the vagal nerve (NTS and PBN) correlated significantly with reported bladder sensations.

However, in humans, its underlying neural correlates remain unknown. To close this gap, we investigated appetitive acquisition and extinction with fMRI in a 2-day monetary incentive delay paradigm. During appetitive conditioning, one stimulus (CS+) was paired with monetary reward, while another stimulus (CS-) was never rewarded. Twenty-four hours later, subjects underwent extinction, in which neither CS was reinforced. Appetitive conditioning elicited stronger skin conductance responses to the CS+ as compared with the CS-. Regarding subjective ratings, the CS+ was rated more pleasant and arousing than the CS- after conditioning. Furthermore, fMRI-results (CS+ - CS-) showed activation of the reward circuitry including amygdala, midbrain and striatal areas. During extinction, conditioned responses were successfully extinguished. In the early phase of extinction, we found a significant activation of the caudate, the hippocampus, the dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC and vACC). In the late phase, we found significant activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the amygdala. Correlational analyses with subjective ratings linked extinction success to the vACC and the NAcc, while associating the dACC with reduced extinction.

Epub 2017 Feb 2.","Misophonia is an affective sound-processing disorder characterized by the experience of strong negative emotions (anger and anxiety) in response to everyday sounds, such as those generated by other people eating, drinking, chewing, and breathing [1-8]. The commonplace nature of these sounds (often referred to as ""trigger sounds"") makes misophonia a devastating disorder for sufferers and their families, and yet nothing is known about the underlying mechanism. Using functional and structural MRI coupled with physiological measurements, we demonstrate that misophonic subjects show specific trigger-sound-related responses in brain and body. Specifically, fMRI showed that in misophonic subjects, trigger sounds elicit greatly exaggerated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), a core hub of the ""salience network"" that is critical for perception of interoceptive signals and emotion processing. Trigger sounds in misophonics were associated with abnormal functional connectivity between AIC and a network of regions responsible for the processing and regulation of emotions, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posteromedial cortex (PMC), hippocampus, and amygdala. Trigger sounds elicited heightened heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) in misophonic subjects, which were mediated by AIC activity. Questionnaire analysis showed that misophonic subjects perceived their bodies differently: they scored higher on interoceptive sensibility than controls, consistent with abnormal functioning of AIC. Finally, brain structural measurements implied greater myelination within vmPFC in misophonic individuals. Overall, our results show that misophonia is a disorder in which abnormal salience is attributed to particular sounds based on the abnormal activation and functional connectivity of AIC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28162895,N,misophonobic?,,,

Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was conducted to identify the modulatory effects of gratitude on the default mode, emotion, and reward-motivation networks. The average HR was significantly lower during the gratitude intervention than during the resentment intervention. Temporostriatal FC showed a positive correlation with HR during the gratitude intervention, but not during the resentment intervention.

Epub 2016 Dec 27.","The efficiency of finding an object in a crowded environment depends largely on the similarity of nontargets to the search target. Models of attention theorize that the similarity is determined by representations stored within an ""attentional template"" held in working memory. However, the degree to which the contents of the attentional template are individually unique and where those idiosyncratic representations are encoded in the brain are unknown. We investigated this problem using representational similarity analysis of human fMRI data to measure the common and idiosyncratic representations of famous face morphs during an identity categorization task; data from the categorization task were then used to predict performance on a separate identity search task. We hypothesized that the idiosyncratic categorical representations of the continuous face morphs would predict their distractability when searching for each target identity. The results identified that patterns of activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as well as in face-selective areas in the ventral temporal cortex were highly correlated with the patterns of behavioral categorization of face morphs and search performance that were common across subjects. However, the individually unique components of the categorization behavior were reliably decoded only in right LPFC. Moreover, the neural pattern in right LPFC successfully predicted idiosyncratic variability in search performance, such that reaction times were longer when distractors had a higher probability of being categorized as the target identity. These results suggest that the prefrontal cortex encodes individually unique components of categorical representations that are also present in attentional templates for target search. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Everyone's perception of the world is uniquely shaped by personal experiences and preferences. Using functional MRI, we show that individual differences in the categorization of face morphs between two identities could be decoded from the prefrontal cortex and the ventral temporal cortex. Moreover, the individually unique representations in prefrontal cortex predicted idiosyncratic variability in attentional performance when looking for each identity in the ""crowd"" of another morphed face in a separate search task. Our results reveal that the representation of task-related information in prefrontal cortex is individually unique and preserved across categorization and search performance.

Using multi-voxel pattern approach, we compared neural pattern similarity for the self and family conditions and found that mothers showed greater perceptual similarity between self and child in the fusiform face area (FFA), representing high self-child overlap, whereas adolescents showed significantly less self-mother overlap. Adolescents' pattern similarity was dependent upon family relationship quality, such that they showed greater self-mother overlap with higher relationship quality, whereas mothers' pattern similarity was independent of relationship quality. Furthermore, adolescents' perceptual similarity in the FFA was associated with increased social brain activation (e.g. temporal parietal junction). Mediation analyses indicated that high relationship quality was associated with greater social brain activation, which was mediated by greater self-mother overlap in the FFA. Our findings suggest that adolescents show more distinct neural patterns in perceiving their own vs their mother's distress, and such distinction is sensitive to mother-child relationship quality.

METHODS: A two-group randomized experimental design was used. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. All patients received baseline assessments of state anxiety using Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and HRV before receiving an intravenous injection of radiopharmaceutical fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose in the uptake room. The experimental group (n = 35) listened individually to 30 min of meditative music, integrating Chinese ""Chi"" and western frequency resonation in the uptake room. The control group (n = 37) lay on bed quietly for 40 min in the uptake room without music. All patients were assessed for their anxiety level and HRV again, before receiving PET scanning as post-test. RESULTS: The results indicated that patients in the experimental group showed a significant reduction in state anxiety and heart rate, and increase on high frequency norm of HRV (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant reduction on anxiety level (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.001) and high frequency norm (p = 0.001) in the experimental group compared with those of the control group. CONCLUSION: Listening to meditative music as a non-invasive and cost-effective strategy can help maximize efforts to promote comfort and relaxation for patients awaiting stressful procedures, such as PET scans. Meditative music can be effective in alleviating state anxiety of patients during the uptake phase before PET scans. Advances in knowledge: The study provides scientific evidence of the effects of listening to meditative music for reducing state anxiety in patients during the uptake phase before PET scans. It may have the potential to lower the risk of unwanted false-positive fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose uptake in normal organs and to further improve image quality and image interpretation.

Epub 2017 Oct 23.","Sleep, and particularly rapid eye movement sleep (REM), has been implicated in the modulation of neural activity following fear conditioning and extinction in both human and animal studies. It has long been presumed that such effects play a role in the formation and persistence of posttraumatic stress disorder, of which sleep impairments are a core feature. However, to date, few studies have thoroughly examined the potential effects of sleep prior to conditioning on subsequent acquisition of fear learning in humans. Furthermore, these studies have been restricted to analyzing the effects of a single night of sleep-thus assuming a state-like relationship between the two. In the current study, we used long-term mobile sleep monitoring and functional neuroimaging (fMRI) to explore whether trait-like variations in sleep patterns, measured in advance in both male and female participants, predict subsequent patterns of neural activity during fear learning. Our results indicate that higher baseline levels of REM sleep predict reduced fear-related activity in, and connectivity between, the hippocampus, amygdala and ventromedial PFC during conditioning. Additionally, skin conductance responses (SCRs) were weakly correlated to the activity in the amygdala. Conversely, there was no direct correlation between REM sleep and SCRs, indicating that REM may only modulate fear acquisition indirectly. In a follow-up experiment, we show that these results are replicable, though to a lesser extent, when measuring sleep over a single night just before conditioning. As such, baseline sleep parameters may be able to serve as biomarkers for resilience, or lack thereof, to trauma.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Numerous studies over the past two decades have established a clear role of sleep in fear-learning processes. However, previous work has focused on the effects of sleep following fear acquisition, thus neglecting the potential effects of baseline sleep levels on the acquisition itself. The current study provides the first evidence in humans of such an effect. Specifically, the results of this study suggest that baseline rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may serve a protective function against enhanced fear encoding through the modulation of connectivity between the hippocampus, amygdala, and the ventromedial PFC. Building on this finding, baseline REM measurements may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for resilience to trauma or, conversely, to the potential development of posttraumatic stress disorder following trauma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061703,Y,corr,uns,,

Epub 2016 Dec 1.","BACKGROUND: Fear conditioning and extinction are prevailing experimental and etiological models for normal and pathological anxiety. Pupil dilations in response to conditioned stimuli are increasingly used as a robust psychophysiological readout of fear learning, but their neural correlates remain unknown. We aimed at identifying the neural correlates of pupil responses to threat and safety cues during a fear learning task. METHODS: Thirty-four healthy subjects underwent a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pupillometry. After a stringent preprocessing and artifact rejection procedure, trial-wise pupil responses to threat and safety cues were entered as parametric modulations to the fMRI general linear models. RESULTS: Trial-wise magnitude of pupil responses to both conditioned and safety stimuli correlated positively with activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and insula for the entire fear learning task, and with activity in the dACC during the fear conditioning phase in particular. Phasic pupil responses did not show habituation, but were negatively correlated with tonic baseline pupil diameter, which decreased during the task. Correcting phasic pupil responses for the tonic baseline pupil diameter revealed thalamic activity, which was also observed in an analysis employing a linear (declining) time modulation. CONCLUSION: Pupil dilations during fear conditioning and extinction provide useful readouts to track fear learning on a trial-by-trial level, particularly with simultaneous fMRI. Whereas phasic pupil responses reflect activity in brain regions involved in fear learning and threat appraisal, most prominently in dACC, tonic changes in pupil diameter may reflect changes in general arousal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27915119,Y,corr,uns,,

Animal research suggests that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a key role in the maintenance of extinguished fear. Here, we combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the role of GABA in fear recovery in 70 healthy male participants. We associated baseline GABA levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) to indices of fear recovery as defined by changes in skin conductance responses (SCRs), blood oxygen level dependent responses, and functional connectivity from fear extinction to fear retrieval. The results showed that high GABA levels were associated with increased SCRs, enhanced activation of the right amygdala, and reduced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity during fear recovery. Follow-up analyses exclusively for the extinction phase showed that high GABA levels were associated with reduced amygdala activation and enhanced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity, despite the absence of correlations between GABA and physiological responses. Follow-up analyses for the retrieval phase did not show any significant associations with GABA. Together, the association between GABA and increases in SCRs from extinction to retrieval, without associations during both phases separately, suggests that dACC GABA primarily inhibits the consolidation of fear extinction. In addition, the opposite effects of GABA on amygdala activity and connectivity during fear extinction compared to fear recovery suggest that dACC GABA may initially facilitate extinction learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28496404,N,no corr,,,

RESULTS: We showed that overweight/obese individuals were prone to consume a higher daily salt intake (2.0 g/day higher compared with normal weight individuals after multivariable adjustment, 95% CI, 1.2-2.8 g/day, P < 0.001), furthermore they exhibited reduced salt sensitivity and a higher salt preference. The altered salty taste and salty preference in the overweight/obese individuals was related to increased activity in brain regions that included the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, r = 0.44, P= 0.01), insula (r = 0.38, P= 0.03), and parahippocampus (r = 0.37, P= 0.04). CONCLUSION: Increased salt intake among overweight/obese individuals is associated with altered salt sensitivity and preference that related to the abnormal activity of gustatory cortex. This study provides insights for reducing salt intake by modifying neural processing of salty preference in obesity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29055956,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 28.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the affective, social, behavioral, and physiological effects of the companion robot Paro for people with dementia in both a day care center and a home setting. DESIGN: A pilot block randomized controlled trial over 12 weeks. Participants were randomized to the intervention (Paro) or control condition (standard care). SETTING: Two dementia day care centers and participants' homes in Auckland, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty dyads (consisting of a care recipient with dementia and their caregiver) took part in this study. All care recipients attended dementia day care centers at Selwyn Foundation and had a formal diagnosis of dementia. INTERVENTION: Thirty-minute unstructured group sessions with Paro at the day care center were run 2 to 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Participants also had Paro at home for 6 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: At the day care centers, observations of the care recipients' behavior, affect, and social responses were recorded using a time sampling method. Observations of interactions with Paro for participants in the intervention were also recorded. Blood pressure and salivary cortisol were collected from care recipients before and after sessions at day care. In the home setting, level of cognition, depressive symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms, behavioral agitation, and blood pressure were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Hair cortisol measures were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks. RESULTS: Observations showed that Paro significantly improved facial expressions (affect) and communication with staff (social interaction) at the day care centers. Subanalyses showed that care recipients with less cognitive impairment responded significantly better to Paro. There were no significant differences in care recipient dementia symptoms, nor physiological measures between the intervention and control group. CONCLUSION: Paro shows promise in enhancing affective and social outcomes for certain individuals with dementia in a community context. Larger randomized controlled trials in community settings, with longer time frames, are needed to further specify the contexts and characteristics for which Paro is most beneficial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28668664,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2017 Feb 14.","Cognitive neuroscientists rarely consider the influence that body position exerts on brain activity; yet, postural variation holds important implications for the acquisition and interpretation of neuroimaging data. Whereas participants in most behavioral and EEG experiments sit upright, many prominent brain imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI) require participants to lie supine. Here we demonstrate that physical comportment profoundly alters baseline brain activity as measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG)-an imaging modality that permits multipostural acquisition. We collected resting-state MEG data from 12 healthy participants in three postures (lying supine, reclining at 45 degrees , and sitting upright). Source-modeling analysis revealed a broadly distributed influence of posture on resting brain function. Sitting upright versus lying supine was associated with greater high-frequency (i.e., beta and gamma) activity in widespread parieto-occipital cortex. Moreover, sitting upright and reclining postures correlated with dampened activity in prefrontal regions across a range of bandwidths (i.e., from alpha to low gamma). The observed effects were large, with a mean Cohen's d of 0.95 ( SD = 0.23). In addition to neural activity, physiological parameters such as muscle tension and eye blinks may have contributed to these posture-dependent changes in brain signal. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, however, the present results have important implications for the acquisition and interpretation of multimodal imaging data (e.g., studies combining fMRI or PET with EEG or MEG). More broadly, our findings indicate that generalizing results-from supine neuroimaging measurements to erect positions typical of ecological human behavior-would call for considering the influence that posture wields on brain dynamics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28195522,N,meg,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 25.","KEY POINTS: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. Alzheimer's disease (AD), via frontal compensatory processes, may affect PNS regulation, thereby compromising older adults' capacity for adaptation, and increasing morbidity and mortality risk. Here we found that AD-associated neurodegeneration accompanied an overactive anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn resulted in a high level of PNS activity at rest, as well as strong PNS activity withdrawal in response to the mental effort. This discovery provides the first line of evidence to suggest that AD-associated neurodegeneration links to altered PNS regulation during mental effort in older adults, and that the compensatory processes accompanying frontal hyperactivation appear to be responsible for these alterations. ABSTRACT: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. PNS can reflect an individual's regulatory capacity of frontal brain regions and has been linked to cognitive capacity. Yet, the relationship of PNS function to cognitive decline and abnormal frontal function that characterize preclinical progression toward Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between PNS function and AD-associated neurodegeneration by testing two competing hypotheses involving frontal regions' activity (neurodegeneration vs. compensation). In 38 older human adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or normative cognition, we measured AD-associated neurodegeneration (AD signature cortical thickness; ADSCT), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of frontal regions' spontaneous activation, and an electrocardiography measure of PNS (high frequency heart rate variability; HF-HRV). HF-HRV was assessed at rest and during a cognitive task protocol designed to capture HF-HRV reactivity. Higher HF-HRV at rest was significantly related to both more severe AD-associated neurodegeneration (lower ADSCT scores) and worse cognitive ability. Cognitive impairments were also related to greater suppression of HF-HRV reactivity. High activities of the anterior cingulate cortex significantly mediated relationships between ADSCT and both HF-HRV at rest and HF-HRV reactivity. Notably, these relationships were not affected by the clinical phenotype. We show that AD-associated neurodegeneration is associated with altered PNS regulation and that compensatory processes linked to frontal overactivation might be responsible for those alterations. This finding provides the first line of evidence in a new framework for understanding how early-stage AD-associated neurodegeneration affects autonomic regulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28952161,N,structural,,,

What remains unknown, however, is what neurophysiological mechanisms account for the observed training effect. Much of the work in this area has focused on the central nervous system, neglecting the fact that the peripheral system can contributes to changes of the central nervous system and vice versa. OBJECTIVE: We examined the prospective relationship between an adaptive parasympathetic nervous system response to cognitive stimuli and VSOP training-induced plasticity. METHOD: Twenty-one participants with aMCI (10 for VSOP training, and 11 for mental leisure activities (MLA) control) were enrolled. We assessed high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) during training sessions, and striatum-related neural networks and cognition at baseline and post-training. RESULTS: Compared to MLA, the VSOP group showed a significant U-shaped pattern of HF-HRV response during training, as well as decreases in connectivity strength between bilateral striatal and prefrontal regions. These two effects were associated with training-induced improvements in both the trained (attention and processing speed) and transferred (working memory) cognitive domains. CONCLUSION: This work provides novel support for interactions between the central and the peripheral nervous systems in relation to cognitive training, and motivates further studies to elucidate the causality of the observed link.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28164771,N,no corr,,,

We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying neural network pathophysiology in the blood-brain barrier-dysfunctional hippocampus. Photothrombotic stroke within the rat neocortex was associated with increased intracranial pressure, vasogenic edema, and peri-ischemic blood-brain barrier dysfunction that included the ipsilateral hippocampus. Intrahippocampal recordings revealed electrographic seizures within the first week in two-thirds of animals, accompanied by a reduction in gamma and increase in theta frequency bands. Synaptic interactions were studied in parasagittal hippocampal slices at 24 h and seven days post-stroke. Field potential recordings in CA1 and CA3 uncovered multiple population spikes, epileptiform episodes, and spreading depolarizations at 24 h. Input-output analysis revealed that fEPSP-spike coupling was significantly enhanced at seven days. In addition, CA1 feedback and feedforward inhibition were diminished. Slices generating epileptiform activity at seven days revealed impaired bidirectional long-term plasticity following high and low-frequency stimulation protocols. Microarray and PCR data confirmed changes in expression of astrocyte-related genes and suggested downregulation in expression of GABAA-receptor subunits.

The diagnostic potential of such neural alterations, including their sensitivity and specificity to FM (vs healthy controls) is unknown. We identify a brain signature that characterizes FM central pathophysiology at the neural systems level. We included 37 patients with FM and 35 matched healthy controls, and analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to (1) painful pressure and (2) nonpainful multisensory (visual-auditory-tactile) stimulation. We used machine-learning techniques to identify a brain-based FM signature. When exposed to the same painful stimuli, patients with FM showed greater neurologic pain signature (NPS; Wager et al., 2013. An fMRI-based neurologic signature of physical pain. N Engl J Med 2013;368:1388-97) responses. In addition, a new pain-related classifier (""FM-pain"") revealed augmented responses in sensory integration (insula/operculum) and self-referential (eg, medial prefrontal) regions in FM and reduced responses in the lateral frontal cortex. A ""multisensory"" classifier trained on nonpainful sensory stimulation revealed augmented responses in the insula/operculum, posterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal regions and reduced responses in the primary/secondary sensory cortices, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Combined activity in the NPS, FM pain, and multisensory patterns classified patients vs controls with 92% sensitivity and 94% specificity in out-of-sample individuals. Enhanced NPS responses partly mediated mechanical hypersensitivity and correlated with depression and disability (Puncorrected < 0.05); FM-pain and multisensory responses correlated with clinical pain (Puncorrected < 0.05). The study provides initial characterization of individual patients with FM based on pathophysiological, symptom-related brain features. If replicated, these brain features may constitute objective neural targets for therapeutic interventions.

Insular gyri help coordinate autonomic regulation and show a sex-dependent response to a sympathetic challenge. METHODS: We examined sex-related insular gyral responses to a short static handgrip exercise challenge eliciting parasympathetic withdrawal with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during four 16-s challenges (80% maximum strength) in 23 healthy females (age; mean +/- std 50 +/- 8 years) and 40 males (46 +/- 9 years). Heart rate (HR) and fMRI signals were compared with repeated measures ANOVA (P < 0.05). Additional analyses were performed with age and age interactions, as well as right-handed only subjects. RESULTS: Females showed higher resting HR than males, but smaller percent HR change increases to the challenges. All gyri showed fMRI patterns concurrent with an HR peak and decline to baseline. fMRI signals followed an anterior-posterior organization in both sexes, but lateralization varied by gyri and sex. All subjects showed greater signals in the anterior vs. posterior gyri (females 0.3%, males 0.15%). The middle gyri showed no lateralization in females but left-sided dominance in males (0.1%). The posterior gyri showed greater left than right activation in both sexes. The anterior-most gyri exhibited a prominent sex difference, with females showing a greater right-sided activation (0.2%) vs. males displaying a greater left-sided activation (0.15%). Age and handedness affected a minority of findings but did not alter the overall pattern of results. CONCLUSIONS: The anterior insula plays a greater role in cardiovascular regulation than posterior areas during a predominantly parasympathetic withdrawal challenge, with opposite lateralization between sexes. In females, the left anterior-most gyrus responded distinctly from other regions than males. Those sex-specific structural and functional brain patterns may contribute over time to variations in cardiovascular disease between the sexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435658,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 30.","PURPOSE: The pupil light reflex is considered to be a simple subcortical reflex. However, many studies have proven that patients with isolated occipital lesions with homonymous hemianopia show pupillary hemihypokinesia. Our hypothesis is that the afferent pupillary system consists of two pathways: one via intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), the other running through the normal RGCs via the visual cortex. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis of these two separate pupillomotor pathways. METHODS: 12 patients (59.1 +/- 18.8 years) with homonymous hemianopia due to post-geniculate lesions of the visual pathway and 20 normal controls (58.6 +/- 12.9 years) were examined using chromatic pupillography: stimulus intensity was 28 lx corneal illumination, stimulus duration was 4.0 s, and the stimulus wavelengths were 420 +/- 20 nm (blue) and 605 +/- 20 nm (red), respectively. The examined parameters were baseline pupil diameter, latency, and relative amplitudes (absolute amplitudes compared to baseline), measured at maximal constriction, at 3 s after stimulus onset, at stimulus offset, and at 3 s and 7 s after stimulus offset. RESULTS: The relative amplitudes for the red stimulus were significantly smaller for hemianopia patients compared to the normal controls [maximal constriction: 35.6 +/- 5.9% (hemianopia) to 42.3 +/- 5.7% (normal); p = 0.004; 3 s after stimulus onset: p = 0.004; stimulus offset: p = 0.001]. No significant differences in any parameter were found between the two groups using the blue stimulus.

Higher Heart-Rate Variability Is Associated with Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Activity and Increased Resistance to Temptation in Dietary Self-Control Challenges,J Neurosci,"Maier, Silvia U,Hare, Todd A,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,J Neurosci. 2017 Jan 11;37(2):446-455. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2815-16.2016.","Higher levels of self-control in decision making have been linked to better psychosocial and physical health. A similar link to health outcomes has been reported for heart-rate variability (HRV), a marker of physiological flexibility. Here, we sought to link these two, largely separate, research domains by testing the hypothesis that greater HRV would be associated with better dietary self-control in humans. Specifically, we examined whether total HRV at sedentary rest (measured as the SD of normal-to-normal intervals) can serve as a biomarker for the neurophysiological adaptability that putatively underlies self-controlled behavior. We found that HRV explained a significant portion of the individual variability in dietary self-control, with individuals having higher HRV being better able to downregulate their cravings in the face of taste temptations. Furthermore, HRV was associated with activity patterns in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a key node in the brain's valuation and decision circuitry. Specifically, individuals with higher HRV showed both higher overall vmPFC blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity and attenuated taste representations when presented with a dietary self-control challenge. Last, the behavioral and neural associations with HRV were consistent across both our stress induction and control experimental conditions. The stability of this association across experimental conditions suggests that HRV may serve as both a readily obtainable and robust biomarker for self-control ability across environmental contexts. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Self-control is associated with better health, but behavioral and psychometric self-control measures allow only indirect associations with health outcomes and may be distorted by reporting bias. We tested whether resting heart-rate variability (HRV), a physiological indicator of psychological and physical health, can predict individual differences in dietary self-control in humans. We found that higher HRV was associated with better self-control and improved predictions of choice behavior. Specifically, higher HRV was associated with more effective downregulation of taste temptations, and with a diminished neural representation of taste temptations during self-control challenges. Our results suggest that HRV may serve as an easily acquired, noninvasive, and low-cost biomarker for self-control ability.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077722,Y,corr,uns,,

However, the classical square wave, mA range current generator is poorly effective to evoke action potentials on A partial differential and C neurons that represent the majority of vagal neurons at the abdominal level. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: METHODS: The current thresholds for pulsons (S2 & S3) and millisecond pulses (S1) required to trigger action potentials were calculated in 5 anaesthetized pigs using single fibre recording. Similar stimulation protocols were compared chronically to sham stimulation in 24 pigs. After two weeks of chronic stimulation, food intake and brain metabolism were investigated. The electrical characteristics and histology of the vagus nerve were also studied. RESULTS: S3 stimulation required a lower amount of charges to trigger an action potential. Chronically applied S2 & S3 activated the dorsal vagal complex and increased the metabolism of its afferent cortical structures. They also reduced energy intake together with a reduced ingestion of high fat and high sugar diets. All these effects were not observed for the S1 group. The vagal histology for the S1, S2 and S3 groups was not different from that of the sham.

However, which factors contribute to the deterioration of cardiometabolic health in postmenopausal women is debated as the menopausal transition is also associated with increased age and fat mass. Furthermore, indications of reduced cardiometabolic adaptations to exercise in postmenopausal women add to the adverse health profile. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women, matched by age and body composition, and investigate the effect of high-intensity training. STUDY DESIGN: A 3-month high-intensity aerobic training intervention, involving healthy, nonobese, late premenopausal (n = 40) and early postmenopausal (n = 39) women was conducted and anthropometrics, body composition, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, and maximal oxygen consumption were determined at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, the groups matched in anthropometrics and body composition, and only differed by 4.2 years in age (mean [95% confidence limits] 49.2 [48.5-49.9] vs 53.4 [52.4-54.4] years). Time since last menstrual period for the postmenopausal women was (mean [95% confidence limits] 3.1 [2.6-3.7] years). Hormonal levels (estrogen, follicle stimulation hormone, luteinizing hormone) confirmed menopausal status. At baseline the postmenopausal women had higher total cholesterol (P < .001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .05), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .001) than the premenopausal women. The training intervention reduced body weight (P < .01), waist circumference (P < .01), and improved body composition by increasing lean body mass (P < .001) and decreasing fat mass (P < .001) similarly in both groups. Moreover, training resulted in lower diastolic blood pressure (P < .05), resting heart rate (P < .001), total cholesterol (P < .01), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < .01), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol index (P < .01), and improved plasma insulin concentration during the oral glucose tolerance test (P < .05) in both groups. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular risk factors are similar in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women, matched by age and body composition, with the exception that postmenopausal women have higher high- and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. A 3-month intervention of high-intensity aerobic training reduces risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease to a similar extent in late premenopausal and early postmenopausal women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28024987,N,no brain data,,,

Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders. Objectives: To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015. Exposures: Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Main Outcomes and Measures: Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form, and functional connectivity. Results: This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (etap2 = 0.001, P = .79), where etap2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (etap2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (etap2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (etap2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and etap2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (etap2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (etap2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002). Conclusions and Relevance: Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403387,N,no corr,,,

DMN brain systems have been implicated in diverse social, cognitive, and affective processes, as well as risk for forms of dementia and psychiatric disorders that associate with systemic inflammation. Areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and surrounding medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) within the DMN have been implicated specifically in regulating autonomic and neuroendocrine processes that relate to systemic inflammation via bidirectional signaling mechanisms. However, it is still unclear whether indicators of inflammation relate directly to coherent resting state activity of the ACC, mPFC, or other areas within the DMN. Accordingly, we tested whether plasma interleukin (IL)-6, an indicator of systemic inflammation, covaried with resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN among 98 adults aged 30-54 (39% male; 81% Caucasian). Independent component analyses were applied to resting state fMRI data to generate DMN connectivity maps. Voxel-wise regression analyses were then used to test for associations between IL-6 and DMN connectivity across individuals, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and fMRI signal motion. Within the DMN, IL-6 covaried positively with connectivity of the sub-genual ACC and negatively with a region of the dorsal medial PFC at corrected statistical thresholds. These novel findings offer evidence for a unique association between a marker of systemic inflammation (IL-6) and ACC and mPFC functional connectivity within the DMN, a network that may be important for linking aspects of immune function to psychological and behavioral states in health and disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28126500,N,no phys of interest,,,
Adaptive contextualization: A new role for the default mode network in affective learning,Hum Brain Mapp,"Marstaller, Lars,Burianova, Hana,Reutens, David C,eng,Hum Brain Mapp. 2017 Feb;38(2):1082-1091. doi: 10.1002/hbm.23442. Epub 2016 Oct 21.","Safety learning describes the ability to learn that certain cues predict the absence of a dangerous or threatening event. Although incidental observations of activity within the default mode network (DMN) during the processing of safety cues have been reported previously, there is as yet no evidence demonstrating that the DMN plays a functional rather than a corollary role in safety learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction paradigm, we investigated the neural correlates of danger and safety learning. Our results provide evidence for a functional role of the DMN by showing that (i) the DMN is activated by safety but not danger cues, (ii) the DMN is anti-correlated with a fear-processing network, and (iii) DMN activation increases with safety learning. Based on our results, we formulate a novel proposal, arguing that activity within the DMN supports the contextualization of safety memories, constrains the generalization of fear, and supports adaptive fear learning. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of affective and stress disorders, which are characterized by aberrant DMN activity, as they suggest that therapies targeting the DMN through mindfulness practice or brain stimulation might help prevent pathological over-generalization of fear associations.

Consequently, aberrations of the brain-gut axis may be important in the pathophysiology of faecal incontinence (FI) in certain patients. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of recording brain responses to rectal mechanical stimulation in patients with FI using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHOD: A prospective, cohort pilot study was performed to assess brain responses during rectal stimulation in 14 patients [four men, mean (SD) age 62 (15) years]. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals were measured by fMRI during rest and mechanical distension, involving random repetitions of isobaric phasic rectal distensions at fixed (15 and 45 mmHg) and variable (10% above sensory perception threshold) pressures. RESULTS: Increases in BOLD signals in response to high pressure rectal distension (45 mmHg) and maximum toleration were observed in the cingulate gyrus, thalamus, insular cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, supramarginal gyrus, putamen and amygdala. Additionally, activation of the supplementary motor cortex and caudate nucleus with inconsistent activity in the frontal lobe was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the feasibility of recording brain responses to rectal mechanical stimulation using fMRI in patients with FI, revealing activity in widespread areas of the brain involved in visceral sensory processing. The observed activity in the supplementary motor cortex and caudate nucleus, with relative paucity of activity in the frontal lobes, warrants investigation in future studies to determine whether aberrations in cerebral processing of rectal stimuli play a role in the pathogenesis of FI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28436201,N,no phys of interest,,,
Regulation of Brown Adipose Tissue Activity by Interoceptive CNS Pathways: The interaction between Brain and Periphery,Front Neurosci,"Muzik, Otto,Diwadkar, Vaibhav A,eng,R01 DK102455/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/,Switzerland,Front Neurosci. 2017 Nov 16;11:640. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2017.00640. eCollection 2017.","To maintain thermal homeostasis, specific thermogenic tissues are under the control of central thermoregulatory networks that regulate the body's response to thermal challenges. One of these mechanisms involves non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is activated in cold environments in order to defend the body against physical damage as a result of hypothermia. The objective of our study was to assess the interaction between CNS thermoregulatory pathways and sympathetic innervation in BAT during a cold exposure paradigm. Our results show that an innocuous whole-body cooling paradigm induces significant differences in fMRI BOLD signal at the location of the right anterior insula and the red nucleus/substantia nigra region, between lean subjects with high levels of sympathetic innervation in supraclavicular BAT (BAT+ group), and subjects with low levels of sympathetic innervation (BAT- group). Specifically, results indicate significantly larger fMRI BOLD signal changes between periods of cooling and warming of the skin in the BAT+ (as compared to BAT-) group at the location of the right anterior insula. In contrast, the BAT+ group showed significantly smaller fMRI BOLD signal changes in the midbrain between periods of skin cooling and warming. Our findings are consistent with a hierarchical thermoregulatory control system that involves the initiation of inhibitory signals from the right anterior insula toward midbrain areas that normally exert tonic inhibition on the medullary raphe, from where BAT is directly innervated. Our data suggests that exposure to cold elicits differential neuronal activity in interoceptive regulatory centers of subjects with high and low level of sympathetic innervation. As a result, the variability of cold-activated BAT mass observed in humans might be, in part, yoked to different sensitivities of interoceptive cortical brain areas to skin temperature changes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200996,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2016 Oct 27.","Recent work in rodents has demonstrated that basal activity of the local sympathetic nervous system is critical for maintaining brown adipocyte phenotypes in classic brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). Accordingly, we sought to assess the relationship between sympathetic innervation and cold-induced activation of BAT and WAT in lean young adults. Methods: Twenty adult lean normal subjects (10 women and 10 men; mean age +/- SD, 23.3 +/- 3.8 y; body mass index, 23.7 +/- 2.5 kg/m(2)) underwent (11)C-meta-hydroxyephedrin ((11)C-HED) and (15)O-water PET imaging at rest and after exposure to mild cold (16 degrees C) temperature. In addition, (18)F-FDG images were obtained during the cold stress condition to assess cold-activated BAT mass. Subjects were divided into 2 groups (high BAT and low BAT) based on the presence of (18)F-FDG tracer uptake. Blood flow and (11)C-HED retention index (RI, an indirect measure of sympathetic innervation) were calculated from dynamic PET scans at the location of BAT and WAT. Whole-body daily energy expenditure (DEE) during rest and cold stress was measured by indirect calorimetry. Tissue level oxygen consumption (MRO2) was determined and used to calculate the contribution of cold-activated BAT and WAT to daily DEE. Results:(18)F-FDG uptake identified subjects with high and low levels of cold-activated BAT mass (high BAT, 96 +/- 37 g; low-BAT, 16 +/- 4 g). (11)C-HED RI under thermoneutral conditions significantly predicted (18)F-FDG uptake during cold stress (R(2) = 0.68, P < 0.01). In contrast to the significant increase of (11)C-HED RI during cold in BAT (2.42 +/- 0.85 vs. 3.43 +/- 0.93, P = 0.02), cold exposure decreased the (11)C-HED RI in WAT (0.44 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.18) as a consequence of decreased perfusion (1.22 +/- 0.20 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.16 mL/100 g/min). The contribution of WAT to whole-body DEE was approximately 150 kcal/d at rest (149 +/- 52 kcal/d), which decreased to approximately 100 kcal/d during cold (102 +/- 47 kcal/d). Conclusion: The level of sympathetic innervation, as determined by (11)C-HED RI, can predict levels of functional BAT. Overall, blood flow is the best independent predictor of (11)C-HED RI and (18)F-FDG uptake across thermoneutral and cold conditions. In contrast to BAT, cold stress reduces blood flow and (18)F-FDG uptake in subcutaneous WAT, indicating that the physiologic response is to reduce heat loss rather than to generate heat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27789721,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2017 Apr 11.","BACKGROUND: Evidence links the lectin pathway of complement activation to diabetic kidney disease. Upon carbohydrate-recognition by pattern-recognition molecules, eg, mannan-binding lectin (MBL), the MBL-associated serine protease (MASP-2) is activated and initiates the complement cascade. The MASP2 gene encodes MASP-2 and the alternative splice product MBL-associated protein 19 (MAp19). Both MAp19 and MASP-2 circulate in complex with MBL. We tested the hypothesis that MAp19 and MASP-2 concentrations predict the risk of incident microalbuminuria. METHODS: Baseline MAp19 and MASP-2 were measured in 270 persons with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes tracked for incidence of persistent microalbuminuria in a prospective observational 18-year-follow-up study. RESULTS: Seventy-five participants (28%) developed microalbuminuria during follow-up. MBL-associated protein 19 concentrations were higher in participants that later progressed to microalbuminuria as compared with those with persistent normoalbuminuria (268 ng/mL [95% CI, 243-293] vs 236 ng/mL [95% CI, 223-250], P = .02). Participants with MAp19 concentration within the highest quartile of the cohort had an increased risk of microalbuminuria as compared with participants with MAp19 concentration within the combined lower 3 quartiles in unadjusted Cox analysis, hazard ratio 1.86 ([95% CI, 1.17-2.96], P = .009). This remained significant in adjusted models, eg, adjusting for age, sex, HbA1c , systolic blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion, smoking, serum creatinine, and serum cholesterol. MBL-associated serine protease concentration was not associated with incidence of microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results show an association between baseline MAp19 concentration and the incidence of microalbuminuria in an 18-year-follow-up study on persons with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303635,N,clinical,,,

However, it is unknown to what extent individual differences in neural representation of content and lived experience influence this brain-behavior relationship. We examined whether the strength of content-specific representations during persuasive messaging relates to later behavior change, and whether these relationships change as a function of individuals' social network composition. In our study, smokers viewed anti-smoking messages while undergoing fMRI and we measured changes in their smoking behavior one month later. Using representational similarity analyses, we found that the degree to which message content (i.e. health, social, or valence information) was represented in a self-related processing MPFC region was associated with later smoking behavior, with increased representations of negatively valenced (risk) information corresponding to greater message-consistent behavior change. Furthermore, the relationship between representations and behavior change depended on social network composition: smokers who had proportionally fewer smokers in their network showed increases in smoking behavior when social or health content was strongly represented in MPFC, whereas message-consistent behavior (i.e., less smoking) was more likely for those with proportionally more smokers in their social network who represented social or health consequences more strongly. These results highlight the dynamic relationship between representations in MPFC and key outcomes such as health behavior change; a complete understanding of the role of MPFC in motivation and action should take into account individual differences in neural representation of stimulus attributes and social context variables such as social network composition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578131,N,no phys of interest,,,

Recent studies suggest that these contributions are highly variable across subjects and that physiological noise correction may thus benefit from optimization at the subject or even voxel level. Here, we systematically investigated the impact of the degree of spatial specificity (group, subject, newly proposed cluster, and voxel levels) on the optimization of RV and HR models. For each degree of spatial specificity, we measured the fMRI signal variance explained (VE) by each model, as well as the functional connectivity underlying three well-known resting-state networks (RSNs) obtained from the fMRI data after removal of RV+HR contributions. Whole-brain, high-resolution rs-fMRI data were acquired from twelve healthy volunteers at 7 T, while simultaneously recording their cardiac and respiratory signals. Although VE increased with spatial specificity up to the voxel level, the accuracy of functional connectivity measurements improved only up to the cluster level, and subsequently decreased at the voxel level. This suggests that voxelwise modeling over-fits to local fluctuations with no physiological meaning. In conclusion, our results indicate that 7 T rs-fMRI connectivity measurements improve if a cluster-based physiological noise correction approach is employed in order to take into account the individual spatial variability in the HR and RV contributions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28392488,N,methods paper,,,

This phenomenon involves augmented responsiveness to painful stimulation and may entail a clinically worse prognosis. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study pain sensitization in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Sixty patients were recruited and pain sensitization was clinically defined on the basis of regional spreading of pain (spreading sensitization) and increased pain response to repeated stimulation (temporal summation). Functional magnetic resonance imaging testing involved assessing brain responses to both pressure and heat stimulation. Thirty-three patients (55%) showed regional pain spreading (simple sensitization) and 19 patients (32%) showed both regional spreading and temporal summation. Sensitized patients were more commonly women. Direct painful pressure stimulation of the joint (articular interline) robustly activated all of the neural elements typically involved in pain perception, but did not differentiate sensitized and nonsensitized patients. Painful pressure stimulation on the anterior tibial surface (sensitized site) evoked greater activation in sensitized patients in regions typically involved in pain and also beyond these regions, extending to the auditory, visual, and ventral sensorimotor cortices. Painful heat stimulation of the volar forearm did not discriminate the sensitization phenomenon. Results confirm the high prevalence of pain sensitization secondary to knee osteoarthritis. Relevantly, the sensitization phenomenon was associated with neural changes extending beyond strict pain-processing regions with enhancement of activity in general sensory, nonnociceptive brain areas. This effect is in contrast to the changes previously identified in primary pain sensitization in fibromyalgia patients presenting with a weakening of the general sensory integration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28683024,N,clinical,,,

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have shown that a currently relevant task set can be decoded from activity patterns in the frontoparietal cortex, but whether these regions support the dynamic transformation of task sets from trial to trial is not clear. Here, we combined a cued task-switching protocol with human (both sexes) fMRI, and harnessed representational similarity analysis (RSA) to facilitate a novel assessment of trial-by-trial changes in neural task-set representations. We first used MVPA to define task-sensitive frontoparietal and visual regions and found that neural task-set representations on switch trials are less stably encoded than on repeat trials. We then exploited RSA to show that the neural representational pattern dissimilarity across consecutive trials is greater for switch trials than for repeat trials, and that the degree of this pattern dissimilarity predicts behavior. Moreover, the overall neural pattern of representational dissimilarities followed from the assumption that repeating sets, compared with switching sets, results in stronger neural task representations. Finally, when moving from cue to target phase within a trial, pattern dissimilarities tracked the transformation from previous-trial task representations to the currently relevant set. These results provide neural evidence for the longstanding assumptions of an effortful task-set reconfiguration process hampered by task-set inertia, and they demonstrate that frontoparietal and stimulus processing regions support ""dynamic adaptive coding,"" flexibly representing changing task sets in a trial-by-trial fashion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans can fluently switch between different tasks, reflecting an ability to dynamically configure ""task sets,"" rule representations that link stimuli to appropriate responses. Recent studies show that neural signals in frontal and parietal brain regions can tell us which of two tasks a person is currently performing. However, it is not known whether these regions are also involved in dynamically reconfiguring task-set representations when switching between tasks. Here we measured human brain activity during task switching and tracked the similarity of neural task-set representations from trial to trial.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.","BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by dysregulated arousal and altered cardiac autonomic response as evidenced by decreased high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), an indirect measure of parasympathetic modulation of the heart. Indeed, subtle threatening cues can cause autonomic dysregulation, even without explicit awareness of the triggering stimulus. Accordingly, examining the neural underpinnings associated with HF-HRV during both sub- and supraliminal exposure to trauma-related cues is critical to an enhanced understanding of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in PTSD. METHODS: We compared neural activity in brain regions associated with HF-HRV in PTSD (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 18) during exposure to sub- and supraliminal processing of personalized trauma-related words. RESULTS: As compared to controls, PTSD exhibited decreased HF-HRV reactivity in response to sub- and supraliminal cues. Notably, during subliminal processing of trauma-related versus neutral words, as compared to controls, PTSD showed decreased neural response associated with HF-HRV within the left dorsal anterior insula. By contrast, during supraliminal processing of trauma-related versus neutral words, decreased neural activity associated with HF-HRV within the posterior insula/superior temporal cortex, and increased neural activity associated with HF-HRV within the left centromedial amygdala was observed in PTSD as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired parasympathetic modulation of autonomic arousal in PTSD appears related to altered activation of cortical and subcortical regions involved in the central autonomic network. Interestingly, both sub- and supraliminal trauma-related cues appear to elicit dysregulated arousal and may contribute to the maintenance of hyperarousal in PTSD. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4898-4907, 2017.

STUDY DESIGN: The study population included all women diagnosed with severe PET that gave birth at the Soroka University Medical center between 2013 and 2014, and were treated with MgSO4 in the first 24h postpartum. Data were collected from the institutional computerized records. The different parameters were examined in 6h intervals and were compared using appropriate statistical tests. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Change in various postpartum laboratory and clinical parameters. RESULTS: During the study period there were 132 singleton deliveries with severe PET treated with a 24-hours postpartum MgSO4 regimen. Most of the women were primigravida and delivered vaginally. Both mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure values have shown recovery to normal values after the first 6h of treatment (P<0.001). Urine output and proteinuria have demonstrated later recovery (after 12h). CONCLUSIONS: When assessing the natural recovery of severe PET features, the earliest parameter to recover during the first 24h postpartum is hypertension followed by urine output and the proteinuria. Further larger studies are needed in order to confirm these results.

Epub 2017 Jan 9.","PURPOSE: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is a common but underdiagnosed cause of chest pain. Literature is scant regarding effective treatments. We explored the effect of ranolazine on coronary flow reserve (CFR) among symptomatic patients with CMD. METHODS: This pilot double-blinded randomized controlled trial included emergency department patients with chest pain and CMD admitted to an observation unit between June 2014 and November 2015. Participants were assessed by cardiac Rb-82 positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging at baseline and 30 days. CMD was defined as CFR <2 corrected for rate pressure product or <2.5 uncorrected, with no evidence of obstructive or nonobstructive coronary artery disease or calcification. Patients with infarction, hypertensive urgency, heart failure, or prescribed QTc-prolonging drugs were excluded. Participants were assigned to ranolazine or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Primary outcome was change in CFR at 30 days. FINDINGS: We enrolled 31 patients (71% female, mean [SD] age 50 [6] years) with CMD (mean [SD] corrected CFR 1.6 [0.3]). Ranolazine improved CFR at 30 days by 17% (P = 0.005) compared with 0% with placebo (P = 0.67). However, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome as measured by mean change in CFR (0.27 ranolazine compared with 0.06 placebo; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.62). IMPLICATIONS: The emergency department offers a unique venue to diagnose CMD with acute symptoms. In an exploratory randomized controlled trial of symptomatic patients with CMD and no coronary artery disease, promising results were seem with ranolazine and CFR improving at 30 days. Large robust clinical trials are needed to verify improvement of CMD in a sex-specific model.

To explore gender differences in the neural correlates of stress-induced anxiety, the current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain responses in 96 healthy men and women with commensurable levels of trait anxiety as they engaged in a personalized guided imagery paradigm to provoke stress and neutral-relaxing experiences. During the task, a significant gender main effect emerged, with men displaying greater responses in the caudate, cingulate gyrus, midbrain, thalamus, and cerebellum. In contrast, women showed greater responses in the posterior insula, temporal gyrus, and occipital lobe. Additionally, a significant anxiety ratings x gender interaction from whole-brain regression analyses was observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left inferior parietal lobe, left temporal gyrus, occipital gyrus, and cerebellum (P < 0.05, whole-brain family-wise error corrected), with positive associations between activity in these regions and stress-induced anxiety in women, but negative associations in men, indicating that men and women differentially use neural resources when experiencing stress-induced anxiety. The findings suggest that in response to stress, there is a greater use of the medial prefrontal-parietal cortices in experiencing subjective anxiety in women, while decreased use of this circuit was associated with increased subjective anxiety states in men. The current study has implications for understanding gender-specific differences in stress-induced anxiety and vulnerability to stress-related clinical disorders, and for developing more effective treatment strategies tailored to each gender.

Acute stress, however, is believed to impair the functioning of prefrontal-based neural systems, which could result in lessened effectiveness of CR under stress. This study tested the behavioral and neurobiological impact of acute stress on CR. While undergoing fMRI, adult participants ( n = 54) passively viewed or used CR to regulate their response to negative and neutral pictures and provided ratings of their negative affect in response to each picture. Half of the participants experienced an fMRI-adapted acute psychosocial stress manipulation similar to the Trier Social Stress Test, and a control group received parallel manipulations without the stressful components. Relative to the control group, the stress group exhibited heightened stress as indexed by self-report, heart rate, and salivary cortisol throughout the scan. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that reappraisal success was equivalent in the control and stress groups, as was electrodermal response to the pictures. Heart rate deceleration, a physiological response typically evoked by aversive pictures, was blunted in response to negative pictures and heightened in response to neutral pictures in the stress group. In the brain, we found weak evidence of stress-induced increases of reappraisal-related activity in parts of the PFC and left amygdala, but these relationships were statistically fragile. Together, these findings suggest that both the self-reported and neural effects of CR may be robust to at least moderate levels of stress, informing theoretical models of stress effects on cognition and emotion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598734,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 9.","Hyperthermia may impair vigilance functions and lead to slower reaction times (RTs) in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and possibly disturbing cerebral hemodynamic rhythms. To test these hypotheses, we acquired the resting-state BOLD and cerebral blood flow (CBF) data, as well as PVTRTs from 15 participants in two simulated environmental thermal conditions (50 degrees C/25 degrees C). We adopted a data-driven method, frequency component analysis, to quantify the mean frequency of the BOLD series of each voxel. Across-subject correlation analysis was employed to detect the brain areas whose BOLD oscillation frequency was correlated with the RTs. Significant changes of BOLD frequency and CBF within these areas were compared between hyperthermia and normothermia conditions. Spatial correlations between BOLD frequency and CBF were calculated within different brain areas for each subject under both thermal conditions. Results showed that, under both thermal conditions, the RTs correlated with the BOLD frequency positively in the default mode network (DMN) and negatively in the sensorimotor network (SMN). The increase of BOLD frequency in the thalamus and ventral medial prefrontal cortex was correlated with the increase of RTs in hyperthermia compared with normothermia. Hyperthermia decreased BOLD frequency and CBF in the SMN, while it increased CBF in the thalamus and posterior cingulate. In both thermal conditions, the spatial distribution of CBF negatively correlated with the spatial distribution of BOLD oscillation frequency in most cortical areas, especially in cingulate cortices, precuneus, and primary visual cortex. These results suggest that hyperthermia might deteriorate task performance by interfering with the resting-state CBF, and with BOLD rhythms. The overlapping of the thermoregulatory and vigilance functions in the SMN and DMN might underlie the neural mechanisms of the cognitive-behavioral impairments induced by hyperthermia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600679,N,no corr,,,

The aim of two experimental studies was to compare the patterns of brain and cardiovascular activity while both RD and the RA numeric tasks were being solved. The fMRI study revealed greater brain activation while solving RD tasks than while solving RA tasks. In particular, RD tasks evoked greater activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus and selected areas in the parietal, and temporal cortices, including the precuneus, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and the superior temporal gyrus, and the cingulate cortex. In addition, RA tasks caused larger increases in HR than RD tasks. The second study, carried out in a cardiovascular laboratory, showed greater increases in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) while solving RA tasks than while solving RD tasks.

Monitoring cardiovascular effects may help motivate patients for further exercise, and can be an instrument to assess intervention effects in clinical trials. In 1 of 4 stroke patients, the heart rate variability may challenge currently used cardiovascular monitoring. The Graded Cycling Test with Talk Test is a submaximal exercise test independent of heart rate variability, shown reliable for patients with cardiac disease. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with lacunar stroke according to TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria performed an incremental exercise test on a stationary bicycle with a 15 W (watt) increase in workload every minute. Toward the end of each incremental step, the patients recited a standardized text passage and subsequently were asked: ""Are you still able to speak comfortably?"" The test was stopped when the patients were no longer able to speak comfortably. Two consecutive tests were performed separated by 1 hour rest. RESULTS: Sixty patients completed the study. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2.1) was as follows: .97 [95% CI: .95-.98] with only a minor measurement error: 12.9 W for groups of patients (standard error of measurement, SEM95) and 18.3 W for individual patients (smallest real difference). CONCLUSION: The ""Graded Cycling Test with Talk Test"" is feasible and reliable for monitoring exercise effects in patients with lacunar stroke.

Computational models of associative learning effectively capture the production and ongoing changes in conditioned anticipatory responses (eg, skin conductance response), but the impact of this dynamic process on unconditional pain responses remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the dynamic modulation of pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex by fear learning in healthy human adult participants undergoing a classical conditioning procedure involving an acquisition, reversal and extinction phase. Conditioned visual stimuli (CS+) coterminated with a noxious transcutaneous stimulation applied to the sural nerve on 50% of trials (unconditioned stimuli). Expected pain probabilities and cue associability were estimated using computational modeling by fitting a hybrid learning model to skin conductance response elicited by the CS+. Multilevel linear regression analyses confirmed that trial-by-trial changes in expected pain and associability positively predict ongoing fluctuations in pain outcomes. Mediation analysis further demonstrated that both expected probability and associability affect pain perception through a direct effect and an indirect effect mediated by descending modulatory mechanisms affecting spinal nociceptive activity. Moderation analyses further showed that hyperalgesic effects of associability were larger in individuals reporting more harm vigilance and less emotional detachment. Higher harm vigilance was also associated with a stronger mediation of hyperalgesic effects by spinal processes. These results demonstrate how dynamic changes in pain can be explained by associative learning theory and that resilient attitudes towards fear/pain can attenuate the adverse impact of adaptive aversive learning processes on pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715353,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2016 Sep 20.","OBJECTIVES: Although dysfunctional emotion regulatory capacities are increasingly recognized as contributing to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), little work has sought to identify biological markers of this vulnerability. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a promising biomarker that, together with neuroimaging, may assist in gaining a deeper understanding of emotion dysregulation in PTSD. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to characterize autonomic response patterns, and their related neuronal patterns in individuals with PTSD at rest. METHODS: PTSD patients (N = 57) and healthy controls (N = 41) underwent resting-state fMRI. Connectivity patterns of key regions within the central autonomic network (CAN)-including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and periaqueductal gray (PAG)-were examined using a seed-based approach. Observed connectivity patterns were then correlated to resting HRV. RESULTS: In contrast to controls, individuals with PTSD exhibited lower HRV. In addition, whereas controls engaged a localized connectivity pattern of CAN-related brain regions, in PTSD, key CAN regions were associated with widespread connectivity patterns in regions related to emotional reactivity (vmPFC and amygdala to insular cortex and lentiform nucleus; PAG to insula) and motor readiness (vmPFC and amygdala to precentral gyrus; PAG to precentral gyrus and cerebellum). Critically, whereas CAN connectivity in controls was strongly related to higher HRV (insula, mPFC, superior frontal cortex, thalamus), HRV covariation was absent in PTSD subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence for a specific psychophysiological-neuronal profile in PTSD individuals characterized by lower resting HRV and a lack of HRV covariation with CAN-related brain connectivity.

METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary health care centre. In addition to the routine investigations, all patients (n = 96) with PCC/PGL were evaluated with (18) F-FDGPET/CT and majority (n = 78) underwent (131) I-metaiodobenzyl guanidine ((131) I-MIBG) scintigraphy. Forty-three patients also underwent testing for germline mutations in five PCC/PGL susceptibility genes (VHL, RET, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD) and all patients were evaluated clinically for neurofibromatosis-1. RESULTS: The study included 96 patients with PCC/PGL(82 benign and 14 malignant). FDGSUVmax was significantly higher for malignant than benign PCC/PGL(P = 0.009) and for extra-adrenal PGL than adrenal PCC (P = 0.017). In subgroup analysis, metanephrine-secreting PCC and non-secretory PCC had significantly lower FDG SUVmax than normetanephrine-secreting PCC (P = 0.017, P = 0.038 respectively), normetanephrine-secreting-sympathetic PGL (P = 0.008, P = 0.019 respectively) and non-secretory sympathetic PGL (P = 0.003, P = 0.009 respectively).

We previously found that while visual stimulation activated primary (V1) and extrastriate visual cortices (MT+/V5, coding for visual motion), increasing nausea was associated with increasing sustained activation in several brain areas, with significant co-activation for anterior insula (aIns) and mid-cingulate (MCC) cortices. Here, we hypothesized that motion sickness also alters functional connectivity between visual motion and previously identified nausea-processing brain regions. Subjects prone to motion sickness and controls completed a motion sickness provocation task during fMRI/ECG acquisition. We studied changes in connectivity between visual processing areas activated by the stimulus (MT+/V5, V1), right aIns and MCC when comparing rest (BASELINE) to peak nausea state (NAUSEA). Compared to BASELINE, NAUSEA reduced connectivity between right and left V1 and increased connectivity between right MT+/V5 and aIns and between left MT+/V5 and MCC. Additionally, the change in MT+/V5 to insula connectivity was significantly associated with a change in sympathovagal balance, assessed by heart rate variability analysis. No state-related connectivity changes were noted for the control group. Increased connectivity between a visual motion processing region and nausea/salience brain regions may reflect increased transfer of visual/vestibular mismatch information to brain regions supporting nausea perception and autonomic processing. We conclude that vection-induced nausea increases connectivity between nausea-processing regions and those activated by the nauseogenic stimulus. This enhanced low-frequency coupling may support continual, slowly evolving nausea perception and shifts toward sympathetic dominance. Disengaging this coupling may be a target for biobehavioral interventions aimed at reducing motion sickness severity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245927,N,FC,,,

The present study aimed to explore the cisternal segments of the OMN using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. METHODS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled in this study. A constructive interference in steady-state sequence was performed in coronal and axial sections. RESULTS: On coronal images, cisternal portions of the OMN were entirely delineated in 97 % on the right and in 98.5 % on the left. Most of the OMCs were of a round shape, with a centrally located OMN, while 9 % were ectatic with the OMN located eccentrically. In 5.3 % of cases, fetal-type posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs), which coursed adjacent to the superior surfaces of the OMNs at the oculomotor triangle (OMT), were observed. On axial images, cisternal portions of the OMN were identified in all cases. The OMN segment passing through the OMT showed medial, central, and lateral courses.

Epub 2017 Jul 15.","In today's 24/7 society, sleep restriction is a common phenomenon which leads to increased levels of sleep pressure in daily life. However, the magnitude and extent of impairment of brain functioning due to increased sleep pressure is still not completely understood. Resting state network (RSN) analyses have become increasingly popular because they allow us to investigate brain activity patterns in the absence of a specific task and to identify changes under different levels of vigilance (e.g. due to increased sleep pressure). RSNs are commonly derived from BOLD fMRI signals but studies progressively also employ cerebral blood flow (CBF) signals. To investigate the impact of sleep pressure on RSNs, we examined RSNs of participants under high (19 h awake) and normal (10 h awake) sleep pressure with three imaging modalities (arterial spin labeling, BOLD, pseudo BOLD) while providing confirmation of vigilance states in most conditions. We demonstrated that CBF and pseudo BOLD signals (measured with arterial spin labeling) are suited to derive independent component analysis based RSNs. The spatial map differences of these RSNs were rather small, suggesting a strong biological substrate underlying these networks. Interestingly, increased sleep pressure, namely longer time awake, specifically changed the functional network connectivity (FNC) between RSNs. In summary, all FNCs of the default mode network with any other network or component showed increasing effects as a function of increased 'time awake'. All other FNCs became more anti-correlated with increased 'time awake'. The sensorimotor networks were the only ones who showed a within network change of FNC, namely decreased connectivity as function of 'time awake'. These specific changes of FNC could reflect both compensatory mechanisms aiming to fight sleep as well as a first reduction of consciousness while becoming drowsy. We think that the specific changes observed in functional network connectivity could imply an impairment of information transfer between the affected RSNs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712063,N,no phys of interest,116,,
Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip: A Mysterious Cause of Hip Pain in Adults,Indian J Orthop,"Vaishya, Raju,Agarwal, Amit Kumar,Kumar, Virender,Vijay, Vipul,Vaish, Abhishek,eng,Switzerland,Indian J Orthop. 2017 Jul-Aug;51(4):455-460. doi: 10.4103/ortho.IJOrtho_607_16.","BACKGROUND: Transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) is a poorly understood and forgotten clinical entity. The diagnosis is often delayed, and inappropriate treatment is provided, due to the lack of its awareness among the clinicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients (11 male and one female) within the age group of 35-50 years, were identified retrospectively from the hospital records between July 2011 and June 2015 who had evidence of TOH on clinical and radiological parameters. RESULTS: All the patients were treated conservatively by nonweight bearing mobilization, anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates, calcium, and Vitamin D supplements. None of our patients had any symptoms after 6 months of conservative management. The disease did not progress, and there was no evidence of hip joint involvement in any of the cases. Plain radiographs were not diagnostic in the early detection of TOH. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be highly specific and sensitive in diagnosing TOH. The clinical condition of TOH is characterized by its acute onset of hip pain in middle-aged people, and its symptoms are out of proportion to the radiological findings. CONCLUSION: The TOH is a nondestructive and self-limiting condition of the hip, which responds well to the conservative treatment. We believe that TOH could be a subset of complex regional pain syndrome type 1, as it has many similarities in clinical presentation and management. Awareness of this entity is important to the clinicians for an early diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary treatment for other mimicking conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28790475,N,no brain data,,,

Our results show that activity in the Temporal Gyrus, Frontal Orbital Cortex, Temporal Fusiform and Opercular cortices, Planum Temporale, and Paracingulate cortex are negatively correlated with ipApEn dynamics. Activity in the same cortical areas as well as in the Temporal Fusiform cortex are negatively correlated with ipSampEn dynamics. No significant positive correlations were found. These pioneering results suggest that cardiovascular complexity at rest is linked to a few specific cortical brain structures, including crucial areas connected with parasympathetic outflow.

Improving the Test-Retest Reliability of Resting State fMRI by Removing the Impact of Sleep,Front Neurosci,"Wang, Jiahui,Han, Junwei,Nguyen, Vinh T,Guo, Lei,Guo, Christine C,eng,Switzerland,Front Neurosci. 2017 May 8;11:249. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2017.00249. eCollection 2017.","Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful tool to examine large-scale neural networks in the human brain and their disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders. Thanks to its low demand and high tolerance, resting state paradigms can be easily acquired from clinical population. However, due to the unconstrained nature, resting state paradigm is associated with excessive head movement and proneness to sleep. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI measures is moderate at best, falling short of widespread use in the clinic. Here, we characterized the effect of sleep on the test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI. Using measures of heart rate variability (HRV) derived from simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, we identified portions of fMRI data when subjects were more alert or sleepy, and examined their effects on the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity measures. When volumes of sleep were excluded, the reliability of rs-fMRI is significantly improved, and the improvement appears to be general across brain networks. The amount of improvement is robust with the removal of as much as 60% volumes of sleepiness. Therefore, test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI is affected by sleep and could be improved by excluding volumes of sleepiness as indexed by HRV. Our results suggest a novel and practical method to improve test-retest reliability of rs-fMRI measures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533739,N,no corr,,,

The study involved two consecutive sessions. In the first session, 14 healthy participants underwent a hearing threshold-as well as a categorical loudness scaling measurement in which the individual loudness perception for IS was assessed across different sound pressure levels (SPL). In the second session, these participants underwent three resting-state acquisitions, one without auditory stimulation (no-tone), one with a monaurally presented 12-Hz IS tone (near-threshold) and one with a similar tone above the individual hearing threshold corresponding to a 'medium loud' hearing sensation (supra-threshold). Data analysis mainly focused on local connectivity measures by means of regional homogeneity (ReHo), but also involved independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate inter-regional connectivity. ReHo analysis revealed significantly higher local connectivity in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) adjacent to primary auditory cortex, in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and, when allowing smaller cluster sizes, also in the right amygdala (rAmyg) during the near-threshold, compared to both the supra-threshold and the no-tone condition. Additional independent component analysis (ICA) revealed large-scale changes of functional connectivity, reflected in a stronger activation of the right amygdala (rAmyg) in the opposite contrast (no-tone > near-threshold) as well as the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG) during the near-threshold condition. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that infrasound near the hearing threshold may induce changes of neural activity across several brain regions, some of which are known to be involved in auditory processing, while others are regarded as keyplayers in emotional and autonomic control. These findings thus allow us to speculate on how continuous exposure to (sub-)liminal IS could exert a pathogenic influence on the organism, yet further (especially longitudinal) studies are required in order to substantialize these findings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403175,N,no phys of interest,,,

In preparation for active avoidance a switch in defensive behavior was observed characterized by startle inhibition and heart rate acceleration along with potentiated activation of the amygdala and the periaqueductal grey.

Epub 2015 Dec 22.","OBJECTIVES: Risky behaviour seriously impacts the life of adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Such behaviours have often been attributed to their exaggerated reward seeking, but dysfunctional anticipation of negative outcomes might also play a role. METHODS: The present study compared adult patients with ADHD (n = 28) with matched healthy controls (n = 28) during anticipation of monetary losses versus gains while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and skin conductance recording. RESULTS: Skin conductance was higher during anticipation of losses compared to gains in both groups. Affective ratings of predictive cues did not differ between groups. ADHD patients showed increased activity in bilateral amygdalae, left anterior insula (region of interest analysis) and left temporal pole (whole brain analysis) compared to healthy controls during loss versus gain anticipation. In the ADHD group higher insula and temporal pole activations went along with more negative affective ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Neural correlates of loss anticipation are not blunted but rather increased in ADHD, possibly due to a life history of repeated failures and the respective environmental sanctions. Behavioural adaptations to such losses, however, might differentiate them from controls: future research should study whether negative affect might drive more risk seeking than risk avoidance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26508322,N,clinical,,,

This shift is thought to have important implications for stress-related psychopathologies, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there is large individual variability in the stress-induced bias toward habit memory, and the factors underlying this variability are completely unknown. Here we hypothesized that a functional deletion variant of the gene encoding the alpha2b-adrenoceptor (ADRA2B), which has been linked to emotional memory processes and increased PTSD risk, modulates the stress-induced shift from cognitive toward habit memory. In two independent experimental studies, healthy humans were genotyped for the ADRA2B deletion variant. After a stress or control manipulation, participants completed a dual-solution learning task while electroencephalographic (Study I) or fMRI measurements (Study II) were taken. Carriers compared with noncarriers of the ADRA2B deletion variant exhibited a significantly reduced bias toward habit memory after stress. fMRI results indicated that, whereas noncarriers of the ADRA2B deletion variant showed increased functional connectivity between amygdala and putamen after stress, this increase in connectivity was absent in carriers of the deletion variant, who instead showed overall enhanced connectivity between amygdala and entorhinal cortex. Our results indicate that a common genetic variation of the noradrenergic system modulates the impact of stress on the balance between cognitive and habitual memory systems, most likely via altered amygdala orchestration of these systems.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Stressful events have a powerful effect on human learning and memory. Specifically, accumulating evidence suggests that stress favors more rigid dorsal striatum-dependent habit memory, at the expense of flexible hippocampus-dependent cognitive memory. Although this shift may have important implications for understanding mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, little is known about the source of individual differences in the sensitivity for the stress-induced bias toward habit memory. We report here that a common genetic variation of the noradrenergic system, a known risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, modulates the stress-induced shift from cognitive to habit memory, most likely through altered crosstalk between the hippocampus and dorsal striatum with the amygdala, a key structure in emotional memory.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28115477,N,clinical,,,

However, evidence of the neural basis of the relationship between the deterioration of cognitive function and elevated blood pressure is sparse. Based on previous research, we speculate that variations in brain connectivity are closely related to elevated blood pressure even before the onset of clinical conditions and apparent cognitive decline in individuals over 60 years of age. Forty cognitively healthy adults were recruited. Each received a blood pressure test before and after the cognitive assessment in various domains. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data were collected. Our findings confirm that elevated blood pressure is associated with brain connectivity variations in cognitively healthy individuals. The integrity of the splenium of the corpus callosum is closely related to individual differences in systolic blood pressure. In particular, elevated systolic blood pressure is related to resting-state ventral attention network (VAN) and information processing speed. Serial mediation analyses have further revealed that lower integrity of the splenium statistically predicts elevated systolic blood pressure, which in turn predicts weakened functional connectivity (FC) within the VAN and eventually poorer processing speed. The current study sheds light on how neural correlates are involved in the impact of elevated blood pressure on cognitive functioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484386,N,FC,,,

Observations of changes in heart rate (HR) and in cortical blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) images were made in 52 healthy, active individuals (45-73 yr; 16 women, 36 men) across a range of fitness (26-66 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)). Seven repeated bouts of isometric handgrip (IHG) at 40% maximal voluntary contraction force were performed with functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, with each contraction lasting 20 s and separated by 40 s of rest. HR responses to IHG showed high variability across individuals. Linear regression revealed that cardiorespiratory fitness was not a strong predictor of the HR response (r(2) = 0.09). In a region-of-interest analysis both the IHG task and the HR time course correlated with increased cortical activation in the bilateral insula and decreased activation relative to baseline in the anterior and posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). t-Test results revealed greater deactivation at the MPFC with higher fitness levels beyond that of guideline-based activity. Therefore, whereas high cardiorespiratory fitness failed to affect absolute HR responses to IHG in this age range, a select effect was observed in cortical regions known to be associated with cardiovascular arousal.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our first observation suggests that fitness does not strongly predict the heart rate (HR) response to a volitional handgrip task in middle- to older-aged adults. Second, the BOLD response associated with the handgrip task, and with the HR time course, was associated with response patterns in the cortical autonomic network.

In the olfactory bulb (OB), the coding of odor information has been well studied, but the coding of mechanical stimulation is rarely investigated. Unlike odor-sensing functions of OSNs, the airflow-sensing functions of OSNs are also largely unknown. Here, the activity patterns elicited by mechanical airflow in male rat OBs were mapped using fMRI and correlated with local field potential recordings. In an attempt to reveal possible functions of airflow sensing, the relationship between airflow patterns and physiological parameters was also examined. We found the following: (1) the activity pattern in the OB evoked by airflow in the nasal cavity was more broadly distributed than patterns evoked by odors; (2) the pattern intensity increases with total airflow, while the pattern topography with total airflow remains almost unchanged; and (3) the heart rate, spontaneous respiratory rate, and electroencephalograph power in the beta band decreased with regular mechanical airflow in the nasal cavity. The mapping results provide evidence that the signals elicited by mechanical airflow in OSNs are transmitted to the OB, and that the OB has the potential to code and process mechanical information. Our functional data indicate that airflow rhythm in the olfactory system can regulate the physiological and brain states, providing an explanation for the effects of breath control in meditation, yoga, and Taoism practices.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Presentation of odor information in the olfactory bulb has been well studied, but studies about breathing features are rare.

Thirty-nine young adults rated their subjective experience of arousal to emotionally evocative images while SCRs were measured. They also underwent a separate resting-state fMRI scan. Greater SCR reactivity (an increased number of task-related SCRs) to emotional images and stronger intrinsic salience network connectivity independently predicted more intense experiences of arousal. Salience network connectivity further moderated the effect of SCR reactivity: In individuals with weak salience network connectivity, SCR reactivity more significantly predicted arousal experience, whereas in those with strong salience network connectivity, SCR reactivity played little role in predicting arousal experience.

Transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (tVNS) has been considered as a non-invasive alternative. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on the effects of tVNS used different stimulation parameters and locations in the ear, which makes it difficult to determine the optimal tVNS methodology. The present study used fMRI to determine the most effective location for tVNS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four stimulation locations in the ear were compared: the inner tragus, inferoposterior wall of the ear canal, cymba conchae, and earlobe (sham). Thirty-seven healthy subjects underwent two 6-min tVNS stimulation runs per electrode location (monophasic rectangular 500 mus pulses, 25 Hz). General linear model was performed using SPM; region-of-interest analyses were performed for the brainstem areas. RESULTS: Stimulation at the ear canal resulted in the weakest activation of the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS), the recipient of most afferent vagal projections, and of the locus coeruleus (LC), a brainstem nucleus that receives direct input from the NTS. Stimulation of the inner tragus and cymba conchae activated these two nuclei as compared to sham. However, ROI analysis showed that only stimulation of the cymba conchae produced a significantly stronger activation in both the NTS and LC than did the sham stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that tVNS at the cymba conchae properly activates the vagal pathway and results in its strongest activation, and thus may be the optimal location for tVNS therapies applied to the auricle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27898202,N,no phys of interest,,,

We therefore hypothesized that an elevated ratio of blood pressure to cerebral blood flow, indicative of cerebrovascular resistance, would exhibit earlier and more widespread associations with Alzheimer's disease than cerebral blood flow alone. Further, we predicted that increased cerebrovascular resistance and amyloid retention would synergistically influence cognitive performance trajectories, independent of neuronal metabolism. Lastly, we anticipated associations between cerebrovascular resistance and later brain atrophy, prior to amyloid accumulation. To evaluate these hypotheses, we investigated associations between cerebrovascular resistance and amyloid retention, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy, controlling for neuronal metabolism. North American older adults (n = 232) underwent arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging to measure regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions susceptible to ageing and Alzheimer's disease. An estimated cerebrovascular resistance index was then calculated as the ratio of mean arterial pressure to regional cerebral blood flow. Positron emission tomography with 18F-florbetapir and fludeoxyglucose was used to quantify amyloid retention and neuronal metabolism, respectively. Cognitive performance was evaluated via annual assessments of global cognition, memory, and executive function. Results indicated diminished inferior parietal and temporal cerebral blood flow for patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 33) relative to both non-demented groups, but no cerebral blood flow differences between non-demented amyloid-positive (n = 87) and amyloid-negative (n = 112) cases. In contrast, the cerebrovascular resistance index was significantly elevated in amyloid-positive versus amyloid-negative cases, with additional elevation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, cerebrovascular resistance index group differences were of greater statistical effect size and encompassed a greater number of brain regions than those for cerebral blood flow alone. Cognitive decline over 2-year follow-up was accelerated by elevated baseline cerebrovascular resistance index, particularly for amyloid-positive individuals. Increased baseline cerebrovascular resistance index also predicted greater progression to dementia, beyond that attributable to amyloid-positivity. Finally, increased cerebrovascular resistance index predicted greater regional atrophy among non-demented older adults who were amyloid-negative. Findings suggest that increased cerebrovascular resistance may represent a previously unrecognized contributor to Alzheimer's disease that is independent of neuronal hypometabolism, predates changes in brain perfusion, exacerbates and works synergistically with amyloidosis to produce cognitive decline, and drives amyloid-independent brain atrophy during the earliest stage of disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28575149,N,clinical,,,

Imagined and Executed Actions in the Human Motor System: Testing Neural Similarity Between Execution and Imagery of Actions with a Multivariate Approach,Cereb Cortex,"Zabicki, Adam,de Haas, Benjamin,Zentgraf, Karen,Stark, Rudolf,Munzert, Jorn,Kruger, Britta,eng,Cereb Cortex. 2017 Sep 1;27(9):4523-4536. doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhw257.","Simulation theory proposes motor imagery (MI) to be a simulation based on representations also used for motor execution (ME). Nonetheless, it is unclear how far they use the same neural code. We use multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to describe the neural representations associated with MI and ME within the frontoparietal motor network. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, 20 volunteers imagined or executed 3 different types of right-hand actions. Results of MVPA showed that these actions as well as their modality (MI or ME) could be decoded significantly above chance from the spatial patterns of BOLD signals in premotor and posterior parietal cortices. This was also true for cross-modal decoding. Furthermore, representational dissimilarity matrices of frontal and parietal areas showed that MI and ME representations formed separate clusters, but that the representational organization of action types within these clusters was identical. For most ROIs, this pattern of results best fits with a model that assumes a low-to-moderate degree of similarity between the neural patterns associated with MI and ME. Thus, neural representations of MI and ME are neither the same nor totally distinct but exhibit a similar structural geometry with respect to different types of action.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27600847,N,no phys of interest,,,

The lack of SCD responsiveness to analgesics has led many to propose that nociceptive neural systems engaged when detecting pain become sensitized, resulting in an enhancement of pain response. METHODS: Individuals with SCD and non-SCD controls were exposed to a painful stimuli of varying intensity using a pressure algometer and underwent several neuroimaging tasks. RESULTS: This study identified and characterized the neural correlates of possible central sensitization in SCD. We found functional connectivity abnormalities in individuals with SCD in the brain's somatosensory network, salience network, and default mode network during both an unstructured resting state and paradigm involving acute pain challenge. DISCUSSION: There was evidence for both increased and decreased connectivity which is consistent with findings in other chronic pain disorders. Preliminary evidence was found that subcortical brain regions might contribute to neurodevelopmental abnormalities in chronic pain. The results support a model in which SCD pain sensitization involves abnormally low functional integration of brain regions that make use of nociceptive information to plan movements, and hyperconnectivity of various frontal and parietal lobe regions that direct attention to or represent higher-order abstractions within circuits involved with either nocioceptive processing or detection of abnormally salient environmental stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28272117,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: fMRI was performed on 9 POAG participants (61+/-11 y old) and 9 age-matched controls (58+/-5 y old) were studied. A wide-view visual presentation (+/-55 degrees) was used to evaluate central and peripheral vision. Cortical magnification factors and BOLD% changes as a function of eccentricity. Correlation analysis between BOLD% changes and visual field scores, and between BOLD% changes and retinal nerve fiber layer thicknesses was performed. Comparison of BOLD% changes for individual visual field quadrants between POAG subgroups and normal group was performed. RESULTS: BOLD% changes of POAG participants in peripheral visual regions were reduced compared to normals but similar in central visual regions, consistent with the notion of peripheral vision being affected first and more compared to central vision. fMRI retinotopic mapping revealed enlarged representation of the parafovea in the visual cortex of POAG participants compared to normals. Cortical magnification of the central, but not peripheral, visual representation in the visual cortex was larger in POAG participants, suggesting functional remapping. BOLD% changes of individual visual field quadrants were significantly correlated with visual field scores and with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in the corresponding quadrants. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that there are functional alteration and remapping in the topographic representation of the visual cortex in POAG participants, and these changes are correlated with disease severity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28221328,N,clinical,,,

Here, we probed changes over time in the brain network associated with cognitive control (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal posterior parietal cortex, and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) using both behavioral assays and functional brain imaging during a selective working memory task in 69 healthy participants within the age range 18-38 years (mean: 25, SD: +/-6), assessed twice, 2 years apart. We aimed to explore the relationship of changing network activation and connectivity with behavioral tasks associated with cognitive control in this otherwise neurodevelopmentally stable group. We found that increased connectivity between frontoparietal cognitive control network regions during the working memory task was associated with improved memory and executive functions over the 2-year period and that this association was not impacted by age, gender, or baseline performance. These results provide evidence that changes in the functional organization of the cognitive control brain network occur despite the absence of neurodevelopment, aging or targeted cognitive training effects, and could modulate cognitive performance in early to mid-adulthood. Understanding how and why this change is occurring could provide insights into the mechanisms through which cognitive control ability is cultivated over time.

Our study aimed to examine how participants weigh benefits (reduction in disease progression) and probability of risk (medications' side effects) when making hypothetical treatment decisions, and to identify the neural networks implicated in this process. Fourteen healthy participants were recruited to perform a treatment decision probability discounting task using MRI. Behavioral responses and skin conductance responses (SCRs) were measured. A whole brain analysis were performed to compare activity changes between ""mild"" and ""severe"" medications' side effects conditions. Then, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventral striatum (VS), amygdala and insula were chosen for effective connectivity analysis. Behavioral data showed that participants are more likely to refuse medication when side effects are high and efficacy is low. SCRs values were significantly higher when people made medication decisions in the severe compared to mild condition. Functionally, OFC and VS were activated in the mild condition and were associated with increased likehood of choosing to take medication (higher area under the curve ""AUC"" side effects/efficacy). These regions also demonstrated an increased effective connectivity when participants valued treatment benefits. By contrast, the OFC, insula and amygdala were activated in the severe condition and were associated with and increased likelihood to refuse treatment.

DESIGN: Randomised, open label, non-inferiority trial. SETTING: Urology and radiology departments of a Swiss tertiary care centre. PARTICIPANTS: 103 patients aged >/=40 years with refractory lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia were randomised between 11 February 2014 and 24 May 2017; 48 and 51 patients reached the primary endpoint 12 weeks after PAE and TURP, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: PAE performed with 250-400 mum microspheres under local anaesthesia versus monopolar TURP performed under spinal or general anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in international prostate symptoms score (IPSS) from baseline to 12 weeks after surgery; a difference of less than 3 points between treatments was defined as non-inferiority for PAE and tested with a one sided t test. Secondary outcomes included further questionnaires, functional measures, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and adverse events; changes from baseline to 12 weeks were compared between treatments with two sided tests for superiority. RESULTS: Mean reduction in IPSS from baseline to 12 weeks was -9.23 points after PAE and -10.77 points after TURP. Although the difference was less than 3 points (1.54 points in favour of TURP (95% confidence interval -1.45 to 4.52)), non-inferiority of PAE could not be shown (P=0.17). None of the patient reported secondary outcomes differed significantly between treatments when tested for superiority; IPSS also did not differ significantly (P=0.31). At 12 weeks, PAE was less effective than TURP regarding changes in maximum rate of urinary flow (5.19 v 15.34 mL/s; difference 10.15 (95% confidence interval -14.67 to -5.63); P<0.001), postvoid residual urine (-86.36 v -199.98 mL; 113.62 (39.25 to 187.98); P=0.003), prostate volume (-12.17 v -30.27 mL; 18.11 (10.11 to 26.10); P<0.001), and desobstructive effectiveness according to pressure flow studies (56% v 93% shift towards less obstructive category; P=0.003). Fewer adverse events occurred after PAE than after TURP (36 v 70 events; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia seen 12 weeks after PAE is close to that after TURP. PAE is associated with fewer complications than TURP but has disadvantages regarding functional outcomes, which should be considered when selecting patients. Further comparative study findings, including longer follow-up, should be evaluated before PAE can be considered as a routine treatment.

We studied 29 subjects (mean age 47 [range 20-81] years; 18 men; 11 women). [(18) F]FEOBV binding was highest in striatum, intermediate in the amygdala, hippocampal formation, thalamus, rostral brainstem, some cerebellar regions, and lower in other regions.

Thalamic [(18) F]FEOBV binding was inhomogeneous with greatest binding in the lateral geniculate nuclei and relatively high binding in medial and posterior thalamus. Cerebellar cortical [(18) F]FEOBV binding was high in vermis and flocculus, and lower in the lateral cortices. Brainstem [(18) F]FEOBV binding was most prominent at the mesopontine junction, likely associated with the pedunculopontine-laterodorsal tegmental complex. Significant [(18) F]FEOBV binding was present throughout the brainstem.

Representational similarity analysis (RSA) has revealed the neural basis of common representational spaces learned early in development, such as categories of natural kinds. This study uses RSA to examine the neural implementation of a newly-learned mental model-i.e., a representational space created through deductive reasoning-and study the structure of previously found parietal activity in reasoning tasks. Specifically, all the information in this mental model could only be obtained through abstract transitive reasoning, as there were no predictive differences between observable features in the stimuli, and stimuli were counterbalanced across participants. Participants were shown unfamiliar face portraits paired with names and asked to learn about the height of each person pictured in the portraits through comparison to other individuals in the set. Participants learned the relative heights only of adjacent pairs in the set and then used transitive reasoning to generate a linear ranking of heights (e.g., ""Matthew is taller than Thomas; Thomas is taller than Andrew; therefore Matthew is taller than Andrew""). During fMRI, participants recalled the approximate height of each individual based on these inferences. Using a predictive model based on the relative heights of the set of individuals, RSA revealed three brain regions in the right hemisphere that encoded this newly-learned representational space, located within the intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, and inferior frontal gyrus. These findings demonstrate the value of RSA for analyzing structure within patterns of activity and support theories asserting that logical reasoning recruits spatial processing mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081195,N,no phys of interest,,,

We investigated whether statistical modelling can be used to describe 24-hour attack distributions and identify differences between subgroups. METHODS: Common hours of attacks for 351 cluster headache patients were collected. Probability distributions of attacks throughout the day (chronorisk) was calculated. These 24-hour distributions were analysed with a multimodal Gaussian fit identifying periods of elevated attack risk and a spectral analysis identifying oscillations in risk. RESULTS: The Gaussian model fit for the chronorisk distribution for all patients reporting diurnal rhythmicity (n = 286) had a goodness of fit R(2) value of 0.97 and identified three times of increased risk peaking at 21:41, 02:02 and 06:23 hours. In subgroups, three to five modes of increased risk were found and goodness of fit values ranged from 0.85-0.99. Spectral analysis revealed multiple distinct oscillation frequencies in chronorisk in subgroups including a dominant circadian oscillation in episodic patients and an ultradian in chronic. CONCLUSIONS: Chronorisk in cluster headache can be characterised as a sum of individual, timed events of increased risk, each having a Gaussian distribution. In episodic cluster headache, attacks follow a circadian rhythmicity whereas, in the chronic variant, ultradian oscillations are dominant reflecting a loss of association with sleep and perhaps explaining observed differences in the effects of specific treatments.

Animal data indicate that local release of norepinephrine (NE) in the hypothalamus is important for triggering hypoglycemia-induced counterregulatory (CR) hormonal responses. Objective: To examine the potential role of brain noradrenergic (NA) activation in humans during hypoglycemia. Design: A hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp was performed in conjunction with positron emission tomographic imaging. Participants: Nine lean healthy volunteers were studied during the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp. Design: Participants received intravenous injections of (S,S)-[11C]O-methylreboxetine ([11C]MRB), a highly selective NE transporter (NET) ligand, at baseline and during hypoglycemia. Results: Hypoglycemia increased plasma epinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone and decreased [11C]MRB binding potential (BPND) by 24% +/- 12% in the raphe nucleus (P < 0.01). In contrast, changes in [11C]MRB BPND in the hypothalamus positively correlated with increments in epinephrine and glucagon levels and negatively correlated with glucose infusion rate (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, in rat hypothalamus studies, hypoglycemia induced NET translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Conclusions: Insulin-induced hypoglycemia initiated a complex brain NA response in humans. Raphe nuclei, a region involved in regulating autonomic output, motor activity, and hunger, had increased NA activity, whereas the hypothalamus showed a NET-binding pattern that was associated with the individual's CR response magnitude. These findings suggest that NA output most likely is important for modulating brain responses to hypoglycemia in humans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29590401,N,no phys of interest,,,

Despite this importance, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the neural basis of these abilities. Investigations into the neural organization of human object representations have revealed category specific organization in the ventral visual stream in perceptual tasks. Interestingly, these categories fall within broader domains of organization, with reported distinctions between animate, inanimate large, and inanimate small objects. While there is some evidence for category specific effects in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), in particular in perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex, it is currently unclear whether domain level organization is also present across these structures. To this end, we used fMRI with a continuous recognition memory task. Stimuli were images of objects from several different categories, which were either animate or inanimate, or large or small within the inanimate domain. We employed representational similarity analysis (RSA) to test the hypothesis that object-evoked responses in MTL structures during recognition-memory judgments also show evidence for domain-level organization along both dimensions. Our data support this hypothesis. Specifically, object representations were shaped by either animacy, real-world size, or both, in perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex, and the hippocampus. While sensitivity to these dimensions differed across structures when probed individually, hinting at interesting links to functional differentiation, similarities in organization across MTL structures were more prominent overall. These results argue for continuity in the organization of object representations in the ventral visual stream and the MTL.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947037,N,no phys of interest,,,

Our study included fMRI scans during and after affective stimulation with sad and neutral movies and a working memory task complemented with measures of cardiovascular activity and mood. Via parcellation of the brain into default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and dorsal attention network, and application of network-based statistics, we identified subnetworks associated with changing psychological contexts. Specific effects for affective stimulation with negative valence were both reduced heart rate variability and mood, and upregulated FC of inter-CEN-DMN connections while intra-DMN connections were downregulated. Furthermore, results demonstrated a valence-specific dynamic carry-over effect in nodes of the CEN, which temporarily increased their FC strength after affective stimulation with negative valence and exhibited distinct temporal profiles.

That is, cerebral blood flow, traditionally thought to be regulated independently of prevailing mean arterial pressure (MAP), might fluctuate, to some extent, as a function of MAP. However, due to limitations associated with experimental usage of pharmaceuticals to manipulate MAP and inconsistent control of arterial carbon dioxide, questions remain regarding the MAP-cerebral blood flow relationship, especially during typical daily activities that alter MAP. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess CA using a nonpharmacological acute psychological stress task to augment MAP, while at the same time controlling for end-tidal carbon dioxide (PET CO2 ). Twenty-five healthy young adults completed a stressful task while continuous measures of MAP, middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv), and PET CO2 were recorded. Slope values obtained from hierarchical linear regression were used to assess the strength of the MAP-MCAv relationship and control for PET CO2 . The stress task significantly increased MAP (p < 0.001) and MCAv (p < 0.001), and decreased PET CO2 (p = 0.05). For every 10 mmHg task-induced increase in MAP, MCAv increased by approximately 3.5%; task-induced changes in PET CO2 did not appreciably change the MAP-MCAv relationship. Greater task-induced MAP responses were significantly related to decreased MAP-MCAv slope values, consistent with CA. These data support the hypothesis that CA is more pressure passive than previously thought and provide initial evidence indicating that a pressure-passive MAP-MCAv relationship may play a role in the observed associations between MAP stress responses, stroke, and cerebrovascular disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30059151,N,no brain data,,,

A fundamental, unresolved question is whether these fluctuations are ongoing and thus persist during task engagement, or alternatively, are quenched and replaced by task-related activations. Here, we examined this issue in the human visual cortex, using fMRI. Participants were asked to either perform a recognition task of randomly appearing face and non-face targets (attended condition) or watch them passively (unattended condition). Importantly, in approximately half of the trials, all sensory stimuli were absent. Our results show that even in the absence of stimuli, spontaneous fluctuations were suppressed by attention. The effect occurred in early visual cortex as well as in fronto-parietal attention network regions. During unattended trials, the activity fluctuations were negatively linked to pupil diameter, arguing against attentional fluctuations as underlying the effect. The results demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations do not remain unchanged with task performance, but are rather modulated according to behavioral and cognitive demands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294387,N,no corr,,,

Critically, however, classification accuracy differences across these studies, which largely share experimental designs and analyses, suggest that there exist one or more unaccounted sources of variance within MVPA studies of affect processing. To explore this possibility, we directly demonstrated strong inter-study correlations between image-induced affective brain states acquired 4 years apart on the same MRI scanner using near-identical methodology with studies differing only by the specific image stimuli and subjects. We subsequently developed a plausible explanation for inter-study differences in affective valence and arousal classification accuracies based on the spatial distribution of the perceived affective properties of the stimuli. Controlling for this distribution improved valence classification accuracy from 56% to 85% and arousal classification accuracy from 61% to 78%, which mirrored the full range of classification accuracy across studies within the existing literature. Finally, we validated the predictive fidelity of our image-related brain states according to an independent measurement, autonomic arousal, captured via skin conductance response (SCR). Brain states significantly but weakly (r = 0.08) predicted the SCRs that accompanied individual image stimulations. More importantly, the effect size of brain state predictions of SCR increased more than threefold (r = 0.25) when the stimulus set was restricted to those images having group-level significantly classifiable arousal properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013469,N,mvpa,,,

Establishing the brain state's central role in affect processing, however, requires that it predicts multiple independent measures of affect. We employed MVPA-based regression to predict the valence and arousal properties of visual stimuli sampled from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) along with the corollary skin conductance response (SCR) for demographically diverse healthy human participants (n = 19). We found that brain states significantly predicted the normative valence and arousal scores of the stimuli as well as the attendant individual SCRs. In contrast, SCRs significantly predicted arousal only. The prediction effect size of the brain state was more than three times greater than that of SCR. Moreover, neuroanatomical analysis of the regression parameters found remarkable agreement with regions long-established by fMRI univariate analyses in the emotion processing literature.

It remains unclear whether emotions can be represented at an abstract level regardless of all three sensory cues in specific brain regions. In this study, we used the representational similarity analysis (RSA) to explore the hypothesis that the emotion category is independent of all three stimulus types and can be decoded based on the activity patterns elicited by different emotions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected when participants classified emotions (angry, fearful, and happy) expressed by videos of faces, bodies, and whole-persons. An abstract emotion model was defined to estimate the neural representational structure in the whole-brain RSA, which assumed that the neural patterns were significantly correlated in within-emotion conditions ignoring the stimulus types but uncorrelated in between-emotion conditions. A neural representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) for each voxel was then compared to the abstract emotion model to examine whether specific clusters could identify the abstract representation of emotions that generalized across stimulus types. The significantly positive correlations between neural RDMs and models suggested that the abstract representation of emotions could be successfully captured by the representational space of specific clusters. The whole-brain RSA revealed an emotion-specific but stimulus category-independent neural representation in the left postcentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and right superior temporal sulcus (STS). Further cluster-based MVPA revealed that only the left postcentral gyrus could successfully distinguish three types of emotions for the two stimulus type pairs (face-body and body-whole person) and happy versus angry/fearful, which could be considered as positive versus negative for three stimulus type pairs, when the cross-modal classification analysis was performed. Our study suggested that abstract representations of three emotions (angry, fearful, and happy) could extend from the face and body stimuli to whole-person stimuli and the findings of this study provide support for abstract representations of emotions in the left postcentral gyrus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405375,N,no phys of interest,,,

The favorable image quality with high and specific neural uptake has been previously demonstrated in animals and humans, but intracellular behavior is not yet fully understood. The aim of the present study is to verify whether it is taken up in storage vesicles and released in company with vesicle turnover. RESULTS: Both vesicle-rich (PC12) and vesicle-poor (SK-N-SH) norepinephrine-expressing cell lines were used for in vitro tracer uptake studies. After 2 h of (18)F-LMI1195 preloading into both cell lines, effects of stimulants for storage vesicle turnover (high concentration KCl (100 mM) or reserpine treatment) were measured at 10, 20, and 30 min. (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) served as a reference. Both high concentration KCl and reserpine enhanced (18)F-LMI1195 washout from PC12 cells, while tracer retention remained stable in the SK-N-SH cells. After 30 min of treatment, (18)F-LMI1195 releasing index (percentage of tracer released from cells) from vesicle-rich PC12 cells achieved significant differences compared to cells without treatment condition. In contrast, such effect could not be observed using vesicle-poor SK-N-SH cell lines. Similar tracer kinetics after KCl or reserpine treatment were also observed using (131)I-MIBG. In case of KCl exposure, Ca(2)+-free buffer with the calcium chelator, ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA), could suppress the tracer washout from PC12 cells. This finding is consistent with the tracer release being mediated by Ca(2)+ influx resulting from membrane depolarization. CONCLUSIONS: Analogous to (131)I-MIBG, the current in vitro tracer uptake study confirmed that (18)F-LMI1195 is also stored in vesicles in PC12 cells and released along with vesicle turnover. Understanding the basic kinetics of (18)F-LMI1195 at a subcellular level is important for the design of clinical imaging protocols and imaging interpretation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29411169,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: Resting-state fMRI scans from patients with PD were analyzed, comparing patients with the highest (n = 24) and lowest (n = 28) quartile scores in a questionnaire assessing autonomic dysfunction in PD (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic [SCOPA-AUT]), obtained from a larger pool of patients (n = 93). Higher scores on the SCOPA-AUT indicate more severe symptoms. Seed-based functional connectivity maps, based on a seed region in the left and right HTH, were computed for each patient and compared by use of a general linear model, with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. Partial correlation tests were additionally performed to test whether the associations between SCOPA-AUT scores and hypothalamic functional connectivity were independent of motor dysfunction, disease duration, cognitive function, and age. RESULTS: Relative to patients with PD with lower SCOPA-AUT scores, patients with higher scores displayed significantly reduced functional connectivity between the HTH and the striatum (caudate, putamen) and thalamus. The significant association between striato-thalamo-hypothalamic functional connectivity and SCOPA-AUT scores was retained after controlling for each patient's corresponding Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, age, disease duration, and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PD with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction show disrupted thalamo-striato-hypothalamic functional connectivity independently of overall motor dysfunction, disease duration, age and cognitive function.

Spectral analysis of diastolic arterial pressure and heart rate allowed assessment of the autonomic nervous system. Hemodynamic variables were monitored using a conductance catheter in the left ventricle and a pressure transducer connected to the left femoral artery. Sympathetic cardiovascular control was reduced after rewarming. Stroke volume increased during cooling but decreased during stable hypothermia and did not normalize during rewarming. Despite autonomic dysfunction, total peripheral resistance increased during cooling and did not normalize after rewarming. The present data show that sympathetic cardiovascular control is reduced by hypothermia and rewarming. A simultaneous systolic dysfunction is seen in rewarmed animals, caused by reduced filling of the left ventricle and impaired contractile function, in the presence of normal diastolic function. These findings show that dysfunction of the efferent sympathetic nervous system could be instrumental in development of rewarming shock. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study shows impaired autonomic control of cardiovascular function after rewarming from severe hypothermia. In victims of accidental hypothermia, rewarming shock is a much feared and lethal complication. The pathophysiology causing such cardiovascular collapse appears complex. Our findings indicate that dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is an important part of the pathophysiology. Thus the present study gives novel information, important for further development of treatment strategies in this patient group.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357499,N,no brain data,,,
Differences in Neural Recovery From Acute Stress Between Cortisol Responders and Non-responders,Front Psychiatry,"Dimitrov, Annika,Demin, Katharina,Fehlner, Phobe,Walter, Henrik,Erk, Susanne,Veer, Ilya M,eng,Switzerland,Front Psychiatry. 2018 Nov 26;9:631. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00631. eCollection 2018.","Adaptive recovery from a stressor fosters resilience. So far, however, few studies have examined brain functional connectivity in the aftermath of stress, with inconsistent results reported. Focusing on the immediate recovery from psychosocial stress, the current study compared amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) before and immediately after psychosocial stress between cortisol responders and non-responders. Differences between groups were expected for amygdala RSFC with regions involved in down-regulation of the physiological stress response, emotion regulation, and memory consolidation. Eighty-six healthy participants (36 males/50 females) underwent a social stress paradigm inside the MRI scanner. Before and immediately after stress, resting-state (RS) fMRI scans were acquired to determine amygdala RSFC. Next, changes in connectivity from pre- to post-stress were compared between cortisol responders and non-responders. Responders demonstrated a cortisol increase, higher negative affect, and decreased heart rate variability (HRV) in response to stress compared to non-responders. A significant Sex-by-Responder-by-Time interaction was found between the bilateral amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (p < 0.05, corrected). As males were also more likely to show a cortisol increase to the stress task than females, follow-up analyses were conducted for both sexes separately. Whereas no difference was observed between female responders and non-responders, male non-responders showed an increase in FC after stress between the bilateral amygdala and the PCC and precuneus (p < 0.05, corrected). The increased coupling of the amygdala with the PCC/precuneus, a core component of the default mode network (DMN), might indicate an increased engagement of the amygdala within the DMN directly after stress in non-responders. Although this study was carried out in healthy participants, and the results likely reflect normal variations in the neural response to stress, understanding the mechanisms that underlie these variations could prove beneficial in revealing neural markers that promote resilience to stress-related disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30534092,N,no corr,,,

Thus, for all studies there is concern about what is truly the TMS effect on cortical neurons. OBJECTIVE: After developing a sham control for use within the MRI scanner, we used fMRI to test the hypothesis of greater regional BOLD responses for active versus control stimulation. METHODS: We delivered 4 runs of interleaved TMS/fMRI with a limited field of view (16 slices, centered at AC-PC) to the left DLPFC (2 active, 2 control; counterbalanced) of 20 healthy individuals (F3; 20 pulses/run, interpulse interval:10-15sec, TR:1sec). In the control condition, 3cm of foam was placed between the TMS coil and the scalp. This ensured magnetic field decay, but preserved the sensory aspects of each pulse (empirically evaluated in a subset of 10 individuals). RESULTS: BOLD increases in the cingulate, thalamus, insulae, and middle frontal gyri (p<0.05, FWE corrected) were found during both active and control stimulation. However, relative to control, active stimulation caused elevated BOLD signal in the anterior cingulate, caudate and thalamus. No significant difference was found in auditory regions. CONCLUSION(S): This TMS/fMRI study evaluated a control condition that preserved many of the sensory features of TMS while reducing magnetic field entry. These findings support a relationship between single pulses of TMS and activity in anatomically connected regions, but also underscore the importance of using a sham condition in future TMS/fMRI studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29530447,N,methods paper,,,

Epub 2018 May 12.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetes increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia sixfold and can be resistant to intervention. We explored the impact of IAH on central responses to hypoglycaemia to investigate the mechanisms underlying barriers to therapeutic intervention. METHODS: We conducted [(15)O]water positron emission tomography studies of regional brain perfusion during euglycaemia (target 5 mmol/l), hypoglycaemia (achieved level, 2.4 mmol/l) and recovery (target 5 mmol/l) in 17 men with type 1 diabetes: eight with IAH, and nine with intact hypoglycaemia awareness (HA). RESULTS: Hypoglycaemia with HA was associated with increased activation in brain regions including the thalamus, insula, globus pallidus (GP), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbital cortex, dorsolateral frontal (DLF) cortex, angular gyrus and amygdala; deactivation occurred in the temporal and parahippocampal regions. IAH was associated with reduced catecholamine and symptom responses to hypoglycaemia vs HA (incremental AUC: autonomic scores, 26.2 +/- 35.5 vs 422.7 +/- 237.1; neuroglycopenic scores, 34.8 +/- 88.8 vs 478.9 +/- 311.1; both p < 0.002). There were subtle differences (p < 0.005, k >/= 50 voxels) in brain activation at hypoglycaemia, including early differences in the right central operculum, bilateral medial orbital (MO) cortex, and left posterior DLF cortex, with additional differences in the ACC, right GP and post- and pre-central gyri in established hypoglycaemia, and lack of deactivation in temporal regions in established hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Differences in activation in the post- and pre-central gyri may be expected in people with reduced subjective responses to hypoglycaemia. Alterations in the activity of regions involved in the drive to eat (operculum), emotional salience (MO cortex), aversion (GP) and recall (temporal) suggest differences in the perceived importance and urgency of responses to hypoglycaemia in IAH compared with HA, which may be key to the persistence of the condition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754288,N,no phys of interest,,,

Methods: Seven patients with type 1 narcolepsy and seven healthy controls underwent two consecutive scans after 2 hr cold exposure: 123I-meta-iodo-benzyl-guanidine (123I-MIBG) single photon emission computed tomography and18F-2-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography to visualize sympathetic innervation and metabolic activity of BAT, respectively. Plasma levels of eight hormones regulating BAT activity were measured before and after 2 hr in the cold. Results: 18F-FDG-uptake and uptake of 123I-MIBG in BAT after 2 hr cold exposure were observed in all individuals, but the activity of BAT was not significantly different between patients with type 1 narcolepsy and healthy controls (p > 0.05). Plasma levels of GLP-1 were higher in patients with type 1 narcolepsy compared with controls (p < 0.05), but not altered by cold adaptation in patients and controls (p > 0.05). FGF21 concentrations decreased after 2 hr cold exposure in both patients with type 1 narcolepsy and healthy participants (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Sympathetic and metabolic activity of BAT was observed after cold exposure in patients with type 1 narcolepsy. Increased GLP-1 in narcolepsy may suggest autonomic dysfunction with metabolic changes. We conclude that BAT is functional after cold exposure in spite of the loss of orexinergic neurons in narcolepsy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771387,N,clinical,,,

Previous fMRI work with this task has used block designs: this study is the first to image an extended (6-minute) RVIP task. Participants were 26 carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele, and 26 non carriers (aged 18-28). Pupil diameter was measured throughout, as an index of cognitive effort. We compared activity to RVIP task hits to hits on a control task (with similar visual parameters and response requirements but no working memory load): this contrast showed activity in medial frontal, inferior and superior parietal, temporal and visual cortices, consistent with previous work, demonstrating that meaningful neural data can be extracted from the RVIP task over an extended interval and using an event-related design. Behavioural performance was not affected by genotype; however, a genotype by condition (experimental task/control task) interaction on pupil diameter suggested that epsilon4 carriers deployed more effort to the experimental compared to the control task. fMRI results showed a condition by genotype interaction in the right hippocampal formation: only epsilon4 carriers showed downregulation of this region to experimental task hits versus control task hits. Experimental task beta values were correlated against hit rate: parietal correlations were seen in epsilon4 carriers only, frontal correlations in non-carriers only. The data indicate that, in the absence of behavioural differences, young adult epsilon4 carriers already show a different linkage between functional brain activity and behaviour, as well as aberrant hippocampal recruitment patterns.

A challenging question is how object semantic space is formed. We tested a novel framework of representing semantic space in the pattern of white matter (WM) connections by extending the representational similarity analysis (RSA) to structural lesion pattern and behavioral data in 80 brain-damaged patients. For each WM connection, a neural representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) was computed by first building machine-learning models with the voxel-wise WM lesion patterns as features to predict naming performance of a particular item and then computing the correlation between the predicted naming score and the actual naming score of another item in the testing patients. This correlation was used to build the neural RDM based on the assumption that if the connection pattern contains certain aspects of information shared by the naming processes of these two items, models trained with one item should also predict naming accuracy of the other. Correlating the neural RDM with various cognitive RDMs revealed that neural patterns in several WM connections that connect left occipital/middle temporal regions and anterior temporal regions associated with the object semantic space. Such associations were not attributable to modality-specific attributes (shape, manipulation, color, and motion), to peripheral picture-naming processes (picture visual similarity, phonological similarity), to broad semantic categories, or to the properties of the cortical regions that they connected, which tended to represent multiple modality-specific attributes. That is, the semantic space could be represented through WM connection patterns across cortical regions representing modality-specific attributes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29624578,N,no phys of interest,,,

Previously, we showed that the anterior insula is involved in the integration of pain intensity and its prior expectation. However, it is unclear whether this integration occurs by a pain-specific expectation or a more general expectation of an aversive event. To dissociate these possibilities, we conducted an experiment using painful stimuli and aversive pictures with three levels of aversiveness on human male volunteers. Stimuli were preceded by a probabilistic, combined modality and intensity cue in a full factorial design. Subjective ratings of pain intensity and skin conductance responses were best explained by a combination of actual pain intensity and expected pain intensity. In addition, using fMRI, we investigated the neuronal implementation of the integration of prior expectation and pain intensity. Similar to subjective ratings and autonomic responses, the dorsal anterior insula represented pain intensity and expectations. The ventral anterior insula additionally represented the absolute difference of the two terms (i.e., the prediction error). The posterior insula only represented pain intensity. Importantly, the pattern observed in the anterior insula was only present if the cued modality was correct (i.e., expect pain); in case of an incorrect modality cue (i.e., expect aversive picture), the ventral anterior insula simply represented pain intensity. The stimulus expectation and prediction error specificity in the ventral anterior insula indicates the integration of expectation with painful stimuli in this area.

Little is known about the neural basis of automatic processing, in particular to task-irrelevant, panic-related, ecologically valid stimuli, or about the association between brain activation and symptomatology in patients with panic disorder. METHODS: The present event-related functional MRI (fMRI) study compared brain responses to task-irrelevant, panic-related and neutral visual stimuli in medication-free patients with panic disorder and healthy controls. Panic-related and neutral scenes were presented while participants performed a spatially nonoverlapping bar orientation task. Correlation analyses investigated the association between brain responses and panic-related aspects of symptomatology, measured using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI). RESULTS: We included 26 patients with panic disorder and 26 heatlhy controls in our analysis. Compared with controls, patients with panic disorder showed elevated activation in the amygdala, brainstem, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex and midcingulate cortex in response to panic-related versus neutral task-irrelevant stimuli. Furthermore, fear of cardiovascular symptoms (a subcomponent of the ASI) was associated with insula activation, whereas fear of respiratory symptoms was associated with brainstem hyperactivation in patients with panic disorder. LIMITATIONS: The additional implementation of measures of autonomic activation, such as pupil diameter, heart rate, or electrodermal activity, would have been informative during the fMRI scan as well as during the rating procedure. CONCLUSION: Results reveal a neural network involved in the processing of panic-related distractor stimuli in patients with panic disorder and suggest an automatic weighting of panic-related information depending on the magnitude of cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms.

Here, we asked native Mandarin participants to listen to speech syllables carrying 4 distinct lexical tone categories across passive listening, repetition, and categorization tasks while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Searchlight classification analyses revealed significant ""cross-task"" lexical tone decoding within the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). RSA revealed that the LIPL and LSTG, in contrast to the RSTG, relate to 2 critical dimensions (pitch height, pitch direction) underlying tone perception.

We found that the ability of human participants to discriminate emotional valence varied as a function of phylogenetic distance between species. Participants were most accurate at discriminating the emotional valence of human vocalisations, followed by chimpanzee vocalisations. They were, however, unable to accurately discriminate the valence of macaque vocalisations. Next, we used fMRI to compare human brain responses to human, chimpanzee and macaque vocalisations.

A prefrontal cortex (PFC)-amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes. However, limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress. Therefore, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate stress-induced changes in PFC-amygdala function during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Participants completed a variant of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) followed (25min later) by a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during fMRI. Self-reported stress to the MIST was used to identify three stress-reactivity groups (Low, Medium, and High). Psychophysiological, behavioral, and fMRI signal responses were compared between the three stress-reactivity groups during fear conditioning. Fear learning, indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning, increased with stress reactivity. Further, the High stress-reactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal (i.e., skin conductance response, SCR) to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the Low and Medium stress-reactivity groups. Finally, the High stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat. More specifically, the High stress-reactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned SCRs. Stress-induced changes in these emotional processes paralleled changes in dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and ventromedial PFC function. These findings demonstrate that acute stress facilitates fear learning, enhances autonomic arousal, and impairs emotion regulation, and suggests these stress-induced changes in emotional function are mediated by the PFC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29555429,N,no corr,,,

The present study investigated whether anticipatory stress is greater prior to research completed in an MRI environment than in a traditional behavioral laboratory. Anticipatory stress (indexed by cortisol) was greater prior to testing in the MRI environment than traditional behavioral laboratory. Furthermore, anticipation of fMRI elicited a cortisol response commensurate with the response to the stress task in the behavioral laboratory. However, in the MRI environment, post-stress cortisol was significantly lower than baseline cortisol.

Although aberrant pain processing has often been noted in clinical observations of patients with ASD, it remains largely uninvestigated. Importantly, the neural mechanism underlying higher order cognitive aspects of pain processing such as pain anticipation also remains unknown. Here we examined both pain perception and anticipation in high-functioning adults with ASD and matched healthy controls (HC) using an anticipatory pain paradigm in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and concurrent skin conductance response (SCR) recording. Participants were asked to choose a level of electrical stimulation that would feel moderately painful to them. Compared to HC group, ASD group chose a lower level of stimulation prior to fMRI. However, ASD participants showed greater activation in both rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during the anticipation of stimulation, but not during stimulation delivery. There was no significant group difference in insular activation during either pain anticipation or perception. However, activity in the left anterior insula correlated with SCR during pain anticipation. Taken together, these results suggest that ASD is marked with aberrantly higher level of sensitivity to upcoming aversive stimuli, which may reflect abnormal attentional orientation to nociceptive signals and a failure in interoceptive inference.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452081,Y,corr,rand,,

Methods In a double-blind randomized sham-controlled crossover study, 20 CH patients received LF or sham stimulation for 30 min on two separate days. We recorded headache characteristics, cephalic autonomic symptoms (CAS), plasma levels of parasympathetic markers such as pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and mechanical detection and pain thresholds as a marker of sensory modulation. Results In the immediate phase (0-60 min), 16 (80%) patients experienced CAS after LF stimulation, while nine patients (45%) reported CAS after sham ( p = 0.046). We found no difference in induction of cluster-like attacks between LF stimulation (n = 7) and sham stimulation (n = 5) ( p = 0.724).

Epub 2018 Jul 10.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies in rodents suggest that somatosensory stimulation could provide neuroprotection during ischemic stroke by inducing plasticity in the cortex-vasculature relationship. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that somatosensory stimulation increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) over several seconds, subsecond changes in CBF in the basal cerebral arteries have rarely been studied due to temporal resolution limitations. This study characterized hemodynamic changes in the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) during somatosensory stimulation with high temporal resolution (100 samples/s) using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD). METHODS: Pneumotactile somatosensory stimulation, consisting of punctate pressure pulses traversing the glabrous skin of the hand at 25 cm/s, was used to induce CBF velocity (CBFV) response curves. Changes in CBFV were measured in the bilateral MCAs using fTCD. All 12 subjects underwent three consecutive trials consisting of 20 seconds of stimulation followed by 5 minutes of rest. RESULTS: Sharp, bilateral increases in CBFV of about 20% (left MCA = 20.5%, right MCA = 18.8%) and sharp decreases in pulsatility index of about 8% were observed during stimulation. Left lateralization of up to 3.9% was also observed. The magnitude of the initial increase in CBFV showed significant adaptation between subsequent trials. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumotactile somatosensory stimulation is a potent stimulus that can evoke large, rapid hemodynamic changes, with adaptation between successive stimulus applications. Due to its high temporal resolution, fTCD is useful for identifying quickly evolving hemodynamic responses, and for correlating changes in hemodynamic parameters such as pulsatility index (PI) and CBFV.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29992676,N,no phys of interest,,,

This study aimed to systematically assess arrhythmia dynamics after virtual ablation of RD sites in computational models. Methods and results: Simulations were conducted in 12 patient-specific atrial models reconstructed from pre-procedure late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans. In a previous study involving these same models, we comprehensively characterized pre-ablation RDs in simulations conducted with either 'average human AF'-based electrophysiology (i.e. EPavg) or +/-10% action potential duration or conduction velocity (i.e. EPvar). Re-entrant drivers seen under the EPavg condition were virtually ablated and the AF initiation protocol was re-applied. Twenty-one emergent RDs were observed in 9/12 atrial models (1.75 +/- 1.35 emergent RDs per model); these dynamically localized to boundary regions between fibrotic and non-fibrotic tissue. Most emergent RD locations (15/21, 71.4%) were within 0.1 cm of sites where RDs were seen pre-ablation in simulations under EPvar conditions. Importantly, this suggests that the level of uncertainty in our models' ability to predict patient-specific ablation targets can be substantially mitigated by running additional simulations that include virtual ablation of RDs. In 7/12 atrial models, at least one episode of macro-reentry around ablation lesion(s) was observed. Conclusion: Arrhythmia episodes after virtual RD ablation are perpetuated by both emergent RDs and by macro-reentrant circuits formed around lesions. Custom-tailoring of ablation procedures based on models should take steps to mitigate these sources of AF recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476053,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, much of what is known about neural dysfunction in PTSD is based on research in chronic PTSD populations. Less is known about neural function that supports fear learning acutely following trauma exposure. Determining the acute effects of trauma exposure on brain function would provide new insight into the neural processes that mediate the cognitive-affective dysfunction associated with PTSD. Therefore, the present study investigated neural activity that supports fear learning and memory processes in recently Trauma-Exposed (TE) and Non-Trauma-Exposed (NTE) participants. Participants completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, participants' threat expectancy was continuously monitored. NTE participants showed greater threat expectancy during warning than safety cues, while no difference was observed in the TE group. This finding suggests TE participants overgeneralized the fear association to the safety cue. Further, only the TE group showed a negative relationship between fMRI signal responses within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and threat expectancy during safety cues. These results suggest the dorsomedial PFC mediates overgeneralization of learned fear as an acute result of trauma exposure. Finally, neural activity within the PFC and inferior parietal lobule showed a negative relationship with PTSD symptom severity assessed three months posttrauma. Thus, neural activity measured acutely following trauma exposure predicted future PTSD symptom severity.

While all errors are registered as such in the rostral cingulate zone, errors enter awareness only when the anterior insula cortex is activated. Aware but not unaware errors elicit autonomic nervous system reactivity. Our aim is to investigate the hypothesis that activation in the insula during error awareness is related to autonomic arousal and to inter-regional interactions with other areas of the brain. To examine the role of the anterior insula in error awareness, we assessed its functional connectivity to other brain regions along with autonomic nervous system reactivity in young healthy participants who underwent simultaneous pupil-diameter and functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements while performing a complex and error-prone task. Error blindness was associated with failures to engage sufficient autonomic reactivity. During aware errors increased pupil-diameter along with increased task-related activation within, and increased connectivity between anterior insula and task-related networks suggested an increased capacity for action-control information transfer. Increased pupil-diameter during aware errors was furthermore associated with decreased activation of the default-mode network along with decreased insular connectivity with regions of the default mode system, possibly reflecting decreased task-irrelevant information processing. This shifting mechanism may be relevant to a better understanding of how the brain and the autonomic nervous system interact to enable efficient adaptive behavior during cognitive challenge.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107022,Y,corr,uns,,

We used isoproterenol, a rapidly acting peripheral beta-adrenergic agonist similar to adrenaline, to induce sensations of palpitation and dyspnea in healthy individuals (n=23) during arterial spin labeling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that the right mid-insular cortex, a central recipient of viscerosensory input, would preferentially respond during the peak period of cardiorespiratory stimulation. Bolus infusions of saline and isoproterenol (1 or 2 mug) were administered in a blinded manner while participants continuously rated the intensity of their cardiorespiratory sensation using a dial. Isoproterenol elicited dose-dependent increases in cardiorespiratory sensation, with all participants reporting palpitations and dyspnea at the 2 mug dose. Consistent with our hypothesis, the right mid-insula was maximally responsive during the peak period of sympathetic arousal, heart rate increase, and cardiorespiratory sensation. Furthermore, a shift in insula activity occurred during the recovery period, after the heart rate had largely returned to baseline levels, with an expansion of activation into anterior and posterior sectors of the right insula, as well as bilateral regions of the mid-insula. These results confirm the right mid-insula is a key node in the interoceptive network, and inform computational models proposing specific processing roles for insula subregions during homeostatic inference. The combination of isoproterenol and fMRI offers a powerful approach for evaluating insula function, and could be a useful probe for examining interoceptive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28726799,M,medicated?,,,

This ""physiological noise"" can confound estimates of resting state network activity, and it may lower the signal-to-noise ratio of ASL during task-related experiments. In this study we examined several methods for minimizing the contributions of both synchronized and non-synchronized physiological noise in ASL measures of CBF, by combining the RETROICOR approach with different linear deconvolution models. We evaluated the amount of variance in CBF that could be explained by each method during physiological rest, in both resting state and task performance conditions. To further demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we induced low-frequency cardiorespiratory deviations via peripheral adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, and determined how these fluctuations influenced CBF, before and after applying noise correction. By suppressing physiological noise, we observed substantial improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio at the individual and group activation levels. Our results suggest that variations in cardiac and respiratory parameters can account for a large proportion of the variance in resting and task-based CBF, and indicate that regressing out these non-neuronal signal variations improves the intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio of ASL.

In different sessions, subjects had to identify either material or action categories in the same sound stimuli. The sound-producing action and the material of the sound source could be decoded from multivoxel activity patterns in auditory cortex, including Heschl's gyrus and planum temporale. Importantly, decoding success depended on task relevance and category discriminability. Action categories were more accurately decoded in auditory cortex when subjects identified action information. Conversely, the material of the same sound sources was decoded with higher accuracy in the inferior frontal cortex during material identification. Representational similarity analyses indicated that both early and higher-order auditory cortex selectively enhanced spectrotemporal features relevant to the target category.

It is an open question whether phantom sound perception results from increased central neural gain or not, a crucial question for any future therapeutic intervention strategies for tinnitus. We performed a comprehensive study of mild hearing-impaired participants with and without tinnitus, excluding participants with co-occurrences of hyperacusis. A right-hemisphere correlation between tinnitus loudness and auditory perceptual difficulty was observed in the tinnitus group, independent of differences in hearing thresholds. This correlation was linked to reduced and delayed sound-induced suprathreshold auditory brain responses (ABR wave V) in the tinnitus group, suggesting subsided rather than exaggerated central neural responsiveness. When anatomically predefined auditory regions of interest were analysed for altered sound-evoked BOLD fMRI activity, it became evident that subcortical and cortical auditory regions and regions involved in sound detection (posterior insula, hippocampus), responded with reduced BOLD activity in the tinnitus group, emphasizing reduced, rather than increased, central neural gain. Regarding previous findings of evoked BOLD activity being linked to positive connectivities at rest, we additionally analysed r-fcMRI responses in anatomically predefined auditory regions and regions associated with sound detection. A profound reduction in positive interhemispheric connections of homologous auditory brain regions and a decline in the positive connectivities between lower auditory brainstem regions and regions involved in sound detection (hippocampus, posterior insula) were observed in the tinnitus group. The finding went hand-in-hand with the emotional (amygdala, anterior insula) and temporofrontal/stress-regulating regions (prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus) that were no longer positively connected with auditory cortex regions in the tinnitus group but were instead positively connected to lower-level auditory brainstem regions. Delayed sound processing, reduced sound-evoked BOLD fMRI activity and altered r-fcMRI in the auditory midbrain correlated in the tinnitus group and showed right hemisphere dominance as did tinnitus loudness and perceptual difficulty. The findings suggest that reduced central neural gain in the auditory stream may lead to phantom perception through a failure to energize attentional/stress-regulating networks for contextualization of auditory-specific information. Reduced auditory-specific information flow in tinnitus has until now escaped detection in humans, as low-level auditory brain regions were previously omitted from neuroimaging studies.

As compared to healthy controls, patients with suspected or confirmed autoimmune TLE-AE showed markedly attenuated skin conductance responses and arousal ratings, especially pronounced for anxiety-inducing stimuli. The degree of right amygdala enlargement was significantly correlated with the degree of autonomic arousal attenuation. Furthermore, a decline of amygdala enlargement following prompt aggressive immunotherapy in one patient suffering from severe confirmed autoimmune TLE-AE with a very recent clinical onset was accompanied by a significant improvement of autonomic responses. Findings suggest dual impairments of autonomic and cognitive discrimination of stimulus arousal as hallmarks of emotional processing in TLE-AE. Emotional responses might, at least partially, recover after successful treatment, as implied by first single case data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29934574,N ,no phys of interest,,,
Task-induced deactivation in diverse brain systems correlates with interindividual differences in distinct autonomic indices,Neuropsychologia,"Iacovella, Vittorio,Faes, Luca,Hasson, Uri,eng,England,Neuropsychologia. 2018 May;113:29-42. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.03.005. Epub 2018 Mar 9.","Neuroimaging research has shown that different cognitive tasks induce relatively specific activation patterns, as well as less task-specific deactivation patterns. Here we examined whether individual differences in Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity during task performance correlate with the magnitude of task-induced deactivation. In an fMRI study, participants performed a continuous mental arithmetic task in a task/rest block design, while undergoing combined fMRI and heart/respiration rate acquisitions using photoplethysmograph and respiration belt. As expected, task performance increased heart-rate and reduced the RMSSD, a cardiac index related to vagal tone. Across participants, higher heart rate during task was linked to increased activation in fronto-parietal regions, as well as to stronger deactivation in ventromedial prefrontal regions. Respiration frequency during task was associated with similar patterns, but in different regions than those identified for heart-rate. Finally, in a large set of regions, almost exclusively limited to the Default Mode Network, lower RMSSD was associated with greater deactivation, and furthermore, the vast majority of these regions were task-deactivated at the group level. Together, our findings show that inter-individual differences in ANS activity are strongly linked to task-induced deactivation. Importantly, our findings suggest that deactivation is a multifaceted construct potentially linked to ANS control, because distinct ANS measures correlate with deactivation in different regions. We discuss the implications for current theories of cortical control of the ANS and for accounts of deactivation, with particular reference to studies documenting a ""failure to deactivate"" in multiple clinical states.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29530799,Y,corr,rand,,

Epub 2017 Dec 4.","PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare diagnostic performance of (68)Ga-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((68)Ga-DOTATATE) with (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) and anatomic imaging using computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance (CT/MR) imaging in detection of SDHx-related pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) in pediatric patients. METHODS: Nine pediatric patients (5:4, girls:boys; 14.6 +/- 2.0 years) with an SDHx-related mutation (SDHB:SDHA:SDHD, n = 7:1:1) were included in this retrospective study. At the time of initial diagnosis, 7/9 patients had metastatic disease. They underwent CT/MR imaging along with PET/CT using (68)Ga-DOTATATE (n = 9), (18)F-FDG (n = 8), and positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MR) using (18)F-FDG (n = 1). In this manuscript, (18)F-FDG PET/CT refers to both (18)F-FDG PET/CT and (18)F-FDG PET/MR. The per-lesion, per-region, and per-patient detection rates were compared and calculated for each of the imaging modalities. A composite of all functional and anatomic imaging studies served as the imaging comparator. RESULTS: Eight out of nine patients were positive for PPGLs on the imaging studies that demonstrated 107 lesions in 22 anatomic regions on the imaging comparator. The per-lesion detection rates for (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, (18)F-FDG PET/CT, and CT/MR imaging were 93.5% (95%CI, 87.0% to 97.3%); 79.4% (95%CI, 70.5% to 86.6%); and 73.8% (95%CI, 64.5% to 81.9%), respectively. The per-lesion detection rate for (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was significantly higher than that of (18)F-FDG PET/CT (p = 0.001) or CT/MR imaging (p < 0.001). In all of the anatomic regions except abdomen, the per-lesion detection rates for (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was found to be equal or superior to (18)F-FDG PET/CT, and CT/MR imaging. The per-region detection rate was 100% (95%CI, 84.6% to 100%) for (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and 90.9% (95%CI, 70.8% to 98.9%) for both (18)F-FDG PET/CT and CT/MR imaging. The per-patient detection rates for (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, (18)FDG PET/CT, and CT/MR imaging were all 100% (95%CI, 63.1% to 100%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary study demonstrates the superiority of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in localization of SDHx-related PPGLs in pediatric population compared to (18)F-FDG PET/CT and CT/MR imaging with the exception of abdominal (excluding adrenal and liver) lesions, and suggests that it might be considered as a first-line imaging modality in pediatric patients with SDHx-related PPGLs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204718,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 29.","OBJECTIVES: Structural changes and metabolic stress have been reported on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the cornu ammonis 1 area of the hippocampus in patients with transient global amnesia (TGA), but a consensus on pathogenesis is still lacking. The aim of our study was to perform a comprehensive ultrasound analysis of the cerebrovascular circulation in our population of patients with TGA. METHODS: One hundred patients with TGA and 50 age- and sex-matched control participants underwent ultrasound examinations of the cervicocranial circulation. RESULTS: The most significant risk factor for TGA was arterial hypertension (P < .01). There were no significant atherosclerotic lesions on the large arteries of the neck (mean internal carotid artery stenosis +/- SD, 28.7% +/- 11.7%) or on the large intracerebral arteries (good structural and hemodynamic status; P > .05). Rarely detected microembolic signals or a right-left cardiopulmonary shunt excluded an emboligenic mechanism of TGA (P > .05). The internal jugular vein valves were incompetent in 54% of patients with TGA, and this condition was associated with an increased risk of TGA (odds ratio, 4.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-9.04). The mean values of the breath holding index and pulsatility index, as parameters of small-vessel function, were within normal ranges and without differences between the TGA and control groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our ultrasound examination did not detect significant structural atherosclerotic changes of cervicocranial arteries, and an emboligenic mechanism was excluded. Only a significant rise of blood pressure in TGA and significant valvular insufficiency of the internal jugular vein were established. New research should clarify whether these simultaneous functional circulatory changes have relevance for metabolic stress in the cornu ammonis of the hippocampus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28850691,N,dti,,,

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a phase II, two arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of losartan to test the efficacy of Reducing pathology in Alzheimer's Disease through Angiotensin TaRgeting (RADAR). METHODS: Men and women aged at least 55 years with mild-to-moderate AD will be randomly allocated 100 mg encapsulated generic losartan or placebo once daily for 12 months after successful completion of a 2-week open-label phase and 2-week placebo washout to establish drug tolerability. 228 participants will provide at least 182 subjects with final assessments to provide 84% power to detect a 25% difference in atrophy rate (therapeutic benefit) change over 12 months at an alpha level of 0.05. We will use intention-to-treat analysis, estimating between-group differences in outcomes derived from appropriate (linear or logistic) multivariable regression models adjusting for minimization variables. RESULTS: The primary outcome will be rate of whole brain atrophy as a surrogate measure of disease progression. Secondary outcomes will include changes to 1) white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral blood flow; 2) performance on a standard series of assessments of memory, cognitive function, activities of daily living, and quality of life. Major assessments (for all outcomes) and relevant safety monitoring of blood pressure and bloods will be at baseline and 12 months. Additional cognitive assessment will also be conducted at 6 months along with safety blood pressure and blood monitoring. Monitoring of blood pressure, bloods, and self-reported side effects will occur during the open-label phase and during the majority of the post-randomization dispensing visits.

Epub 2018 Feb 21.","Relapses represent a major limitation to the long-term remission of pathological fear and anxiety. Stress modulates the acquisition and expression of fear memories and appears to promote fear recovery in patients with anxiety disorders. However, the neural correlates underlying stress hormone effects on the return of fear in humans remain unexplored. Likewise, little is known about the interactions between sex and stress hormones on return of fear phenomena. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 32 men and 32 women were exposed to a fear renewal paradigm with fear acquisition in context A and extinction in context B. On the following day, participants received either cortisol or placebo 40min before return of fear was tested in both contexts in a renewal and reinstatement test. Cortisol increased differential conditioned skin conductance responses in the extinction context B following reinstatement in men but not in women. On the neural level, this effect was characterized by enhanced fear-related activation in the right amygdala in men, while an activation decrement in this region was observed after cortisol treatment in women. Our results revealed that cortisol promotes the return of fear in men by strengthening a key node of the fear network - the amygdala. We thereby provide novel insights into a sex-specific mechanism mediating stress-induced fear recovery which may translate into different relapse risks and treatment strategies for men and women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529523,N,no phys of interest,,,

To advance our understanding of how aging modifies specific neural circuitries, we examined serotonergic and cholinergic stimulation with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) in young and older adults. The instant response to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram (30mg) and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (8mg) was measured in 12 young and 17 older volunteers during a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A powerful dataset consisting of 522 RS-fMRI scans was obtained by acquiring multiple scans per subject before and after drug administration. Groupxtreatment interaction effects on voxelwise connectivity with ten functional networks were investigated (p<.05, FWE-corrected) using a non-parametric multivariate analysis technique with cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, heart rate and baseline measurements as covariates. Both groups showed a decrease in sensorimotor network connectivity after citalopram administration. The comparable findings after citalopram intake are possibly due to relatively similar serotonergic systems in the young and older subjects. Galantamine altered connectivity between the occipital visual network and regions that are implicated in learning and memory in the young subjects. The lack of a cholinergic response in the elderly might relate to the well-known association between cognitive and cholinergic deterioration at older age.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258890,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

These divergent responses are thought to result from sustained functional changes in specific brain regions that modulate the cardiovascular responses to pain. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate brain regions that are functionally coupled to the generation of an MSNA burst at rest and to determine their behavior during tonic muscle pain. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed concurrently with microelectrode recording of MSNA from the common peroneal nerve during a 40 min infusion of hypertonic saline into the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle of 37 healthy human subjects. Results: At rest, blood oxygen level-dependent signal intensity coupled to bursts of MSNA increased in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus and decreased in the region of the midbrain periaqueductal gray. During pain, MSNA-coupled signal intensity was greater in the region of the nucleus tractus solitarius, midbrain periaqueductal gray, dorsolateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices, than at rest. Conversely, MSNA-coupled signal intensity decreased during pain in parts of the prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: These results suggest that multiple brain regions are recruited in a burst-to-burst manner, and the magnitude of these signal changes is correlated to the overall change in MSNA amplitude during tonic muscle pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29541532,Y,corr,rand,,

In the present study, we aimed to investigate indices of successful and unsuccessful response inhibition paying particular attention to the interplay between locus coeruleus (LC), ventral tegmental area (VTA)/substantia nigra (SN) and, most importantly, peripheral markers. We aimed to get insight in the predictive value of neural and physiological signals in response inhibition. A total of 35 healthy controls were recruited from the local community and a typical task of behavioral response inhibition (Go/No-Go paradigm) was applied. We used high-resolution fMRI, advanced brainstem analyses and specifically corrected for respiratory signal and cardiac noise. Our main results characterize specific neural activation patterns during successful and unsuccessful response inhibition especially comprising the anterior cingulate as well as the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. A significant activation of the dopaminergic nuclei (VTA/SN) was found during error processing, but not during response inhibition. Most remarkably, specific neural activation patterns (i.e., dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) as well as accompanying autonomic indices (i.e., skin conductance response (SCR)) were identified to hold predictive information on an individual's performance. In summary, the importance of the VTA/SN during error processing was shown.

BACKGROUND: Using intranasal local anesthesia to block the SPG for the treatment of various headache disorders has been employed in clinical practice since the early 1900s. However, the exact mechanism of how SPG modulate resting state intrinsic functional brain networks connectivity remains to be elucidated. This pilot study seeks to understand the resting state connectivity changes in salience and CENs, with emphasis on the mesocorticolimbic systems, before and after a series of SPG block treatments. METHODS: Using fMRI, resting state connectivity was derived from predefined networks of nodes (regions of interests) for the salience (27 nodes, 351 connections) and CENs (17 nodes, 136 connections). After treatments, a paired samples t-test (with 10,000 permutations to correct for multiple comparison) was used to evaluate changes in the intranetwork resting state functional connectivity within the salience and executive networks, as well as the overall network connectivity strength. RESULTS: When comparing connectivity strength at baseline to that at the end of treatment in our cohort of 10 CM(w/MOH) participants, there were several connections within the salience (n = 9) and executive (n = 8) networks that were significantly improved. Within the salience network, improved connectivity was observed between the prefrontal cortex and various regions of the insula, basal ganglia, motor, and frontal cortex. Additionally, changes in connectivity were observed between regions of the temporal cortex with the basal ganglia and supramarginal gyrus. Within the CEN, improved connectivity was observed between the prefrontal cortex and regions of the anterior thalamus, caudate, and frontal cortex. After treatment, the overall CEN connectivity was significantly improved (Baseline 0.00 +/- 0.08; 6 weeks 0.03 +/- 0.09, P = .01); however, the overall salience network connectivity was not significantly improved (Baseline -0.01 +/- 0.10; 6 weeks 0.01 +/- 0.12, P = .26). Additionally, after treatment, there was a significant reduction in the number of moderate/severe headache days per month (Baseline 21.1 +/- 6.6; 6 weeks 11.2 +/- 6.5, P < .001), HIT-6 (Baseline 66.1 +/- 2.6; 6 weeks 60.2 +/- 3.6, P < .001), and PHQ-9 (Baseline 12.4 +/- 5.7; 6 weeks 6.1 +/- 3.6, P = .008) scores. CONCLUSION: In this longitudinal fMRI study, we observed improved functional connectivity within both networks, primarily involving connectivity between regions of the prefrontal cortex and limbic (cortical-limbic) structures, and between different cortical (cortical-cortical) regions after a series of repetitive SPG blockades. The overall CEN strength was also improved.

Results: Nasal insulin administration dose-dependently modulated regional brain activity and the normalized high-frequency component of the HRV. Post hoc analyses revealed that only 160 U insulin showed a considerable difference from placebo. Dose-dependent spillover of nasal insulin into the bloodstream was detected. The brain response was not correlated with this temporary rise in circulating insulin. Conclusions: Nasal insulin dose-dependently modulated regional brain activity with the strongest effects after 160 U.

In the present study, we analyzed regional global connectivity (rGC) strength (mean cross-correlation coefficient between a brain region and all other regions) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to clarify brain FC changes associated with perinatal blood pressure using data from 16 women with a normal pregnancy and 21 pregnant women with pre-eclampsia. The rGC values in the bilateral orbitofrontal gyri were negatively correlated with diastolic blood pressure (dBP), which could not be explained by other pre-eclampsia symptoms. The strength of FC seeding at the left orbitofrontal gyrus was negatively correlated with dBP in the anterior cingulate gyri and right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that dBP elevation during pregnancy can affect the brain FC.

In patients with transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke, we therefore compared the associations of baseline and long-term premorbid BP with measures of SVD on magnetic resonance imaging brain. Methods- We studied 1009 transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke patients who had a brain magnetic resonance imaging, in the population-based OXVASC (Oxford Vascular Study), and related baseline and 20-year premorbid BP (median: 15 readings/patient) to the total SVD score on imaging. Results- SVD score was associated with increasing mean baseline systolic BP (SBP; odds ratio of top versus bottom BP quartile: 2.28; [95% CI, 1.62-3.21]; P<0.0001) and with prior hypertension (2.53; [95% CI, 2.01-3.20]; P<0.0001), but the association was much stronger with mean premorbid SBP (6.09; [95% CI, 4.34-8.55]; P<0.0001). Mean diastolic BP at baseline was negatively associated with SVD score (0.71; [95% CI, 0.51-1.00]; P=0.050), and a positive association was only evident for diastolic BP 10 to 20 years previously (3.35; [95% CI, 2.33-4.84]; both P<0.0001). Relationships between overall mean premorbid BP and SVD burden were strongest in patients age <70 (SBP: 6.99; 4.11-11.86; diastolic BP: 3.13; 1.95-5.07; both P<0.0001) versus >/=70 years (2.37; 1.42-3.94; P=0.001; and 1.16; 0.74-1.84; P=0.52). Conclusions- Mean premorbid SBP is more strongly associated with SVD burden than baseline SBP or history of hypertension, and baseline diastolic BP yields a misleading estimate of the likely etiological importance of midlife hypertension for the subsequent development of SVD. Studies of novel potential etiological factors for SVD should aim to adjust for long-term prior BP, and trials of BP lowering with only a few years of follow-up may underestimate the overall impact on SVD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354991,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 22.","BACKGROUND: Exaggerated reactivity to acute psychosocial stress is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. A dysfunction of the cortico-limbic network coordinating the peripheral adaptation to acute stress exposure may constitute a brain mechanism underlying this association. We opted to characterize the changes of this network associated with acute psychosocial stress exposure in individuals with low and high cardiometabolic risk (CMR). METHODS: In 57 subjects without overt cardiac or cerebral disease, the Framingham risk score and presence/absence of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome defined CMR. Psychosocial stress was induced during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity by an established social threat paradigm. Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure and saliva cortisol quantified the peripheral stress reaction. Regression analyses for the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, insula and regulatory prefrontal regions evaluated the association of stress-associated brain activation and CMR. RESULTS: Psychosocial stress exposure was associated with an increased activity of a brain network including anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, putamen, insula, parahippocampus and right hippocampus. Psychosocial stress-associated brain activation did neither covary with Framingham risk score nor differ between groups with low or high CMR. CONCLUSION: Exposure to acute psychosocial stress induces the activation of a well-defined cortico-limbic network.

The rate of amyloid/lacune progression, cortical thinning and cognitive decline were evaluated in subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI) patients. METHODS: Seventy-two svMCI patients were divided into early stage (ES-svMCI, n = 39) and late stage (LS-svMCI, n = 33) according to their Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score. Patients were annually followed up with neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging for 3 years, and underwent a second [(11) C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography scan within a mean interval of 32.4 months. RESULTS: There was no difference in the rate of increase in PiB uptake or lacune number between the ES-svMCI and LS-svMCI. However, LS-svMCI showed more rapid cortical thinning and cognitive decline than did the ES-svMCI. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that, whilst the rate of change in pathological burden did not differ between ES-svMCI and LS-svMCI, cortical thinning and cognitive decline progressed more rapidly in the LS-svMCI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29082576,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2018 Apr 18.","This study investigated local and global changes in the motor network using longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Motor impairment was measured in 81 stroke patients using Fugl-Meyer assessment on the same day as rs-fMRI acquisition at both 2 weeks and 3 months post-stroke. The relationships between network measures and motor function scores were assessed. With regard to local connectivity, interhemispheric connectivity was noticeably altered at each time point. Interhemispheric connectivity was also related to residual motor function and improvement in motor function. The anterior intraparietal sulcus and other well-known primary and secondary motor-related regions played important roles in motor function. Changes in global connectivity according to stroke type and initial severity were investigated. In global connectivity, interhemispheric connectivity was disrupted at 2 weeks post-stroke regardless of stroke type and initial severity. During the recovery period, interhemispheric connectivity recovered well in patients with hemorrhagic stroke or low severity. In contrast, there were no significant between-group and within-group alterations in intrahemispheric connectivity. Intrahemispheric connectivity of the inferior frontal cortex (IFC) exhibited opposite alterations compared to other connections. There were no differences between groups in IFC connectivity alterations; however, decreasing ipsilesional IFC connectivity and contralesional IFC during recovery were noticeable in patients with mild to moderate impairments and patients with severe impairments, respectively. These results may be helpful in understanding the network changes that occur after stroke and could have important implications for treatment strategy development in future studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29671156,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2017 Oct 28.","Biological thiols, like cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH), play crucial roles in biological systems and in lysosomal processes. Highly selective probes for detecting biological thiols in lysomes of living cells are rare. In this work, a lysosome-targetable turn-on fluorescent probe for the detection of thiols in living cells was designed and synthesized based on a 1,8-naphthalimide derivative. The probe has a 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine unit as a lysosome-targetable group and an acrylate group as the thiol recognition unit as well as a fluorescence quencher. In the absence of biothiols, the probe displayed weak fluorescence due to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Upon the addition of biothiols, the probe exhibited an enhanced fluorescence emission centered at 550nm due to cleavage of the acrylate moiety. The probe had high selectivity toward biothiols. Moreover, the probe features fast response time, excitation in the visible region and ability of working in a wide pH range. The linear response range covers a concentration range of Cys from 1.5x10(-7) to 1.0x10(-5)mol.L(-1) and the detection limit is 6.9x10(-8)mol.L(-1) for Cys. The probe has been successfully applied to the confocal imaging of biothiols in lysosomes of A549 cells with low cell toxicity. Furthermore, the method was successfully applied to the determination of thiols in a complex multicomponent mixture such as human serum, which suggests our proposed method has great potential for diagnostic purposes. All of such good properties prove it can be used to monitor biothiols in lysosomes of living cells and to be a good fluorescent probe for the selective detection of thiols.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29126010,N,no phys of interest,,,

We investigated whether absent clinical responses are indicative of suppressed spinal and brain responsiveness to noxious stimulation in anaesthetised subjects. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were investigated during deep propofol anaesthesia supplemented with increasing doses of remifentanil in a stepwise manner. Noxious electrical stimuli at an intensity comparable with surgical stimulation were repeatedly administered at each targeted remifentanil concentration. During stimulation, we monitored both clinical responses (blood pressure, heart rate, and movement) and neuronal responses. Neuronal responses were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging, spinal reflex responses, and somatosensory evoked potentials. RESULTS: This monitoring combination was able to faithfully detect brain and spinal neuronal responses to the noxious stimulation. Although clinical responses were no longer detected at analgesic dosages similar to those used for general anaesthesia in clinical practice, spinal and brain neuronal responses were consistently observed. Opioid doses that are significantly larger than is usually used in clinical practice only reduced neuronal responses to 41% of their maximal response. CONCLUSIONS: Nociceptive activation persists during deep general anaesthesia despite abolished clinical responses. Absent clinical responses are therefore not indicative of absent nociception-specific activation. Thus, commonly accepted clinical responses might be inadequate surrogate markers to assess anti-nociception during general anaesthesia. Further research is required to investigate whether persistent nociception causes adverse effects on patient outcome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935584,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: Participants with different sensitivities were assessed according to standard screening and grouped into two groups: insensitivity group (n24) and sensitivity group (n22). All participants were given acupuncture at the left-sided Zusanli point. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) of their body surface was determined before and after the acupuncture, and the two groups were subsequently compared in terms of analgesic effects and PPT rate of change; cerebral fMRI-ASL was performed; software such as SPM 8 and ASLtbx were utilized to preprocess the results, and correlation between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and visual analog scale (VAS) score was determined using Pearson's correlational analysis. RESULTS: VAS score in the sensitivity group was significantly higher than that in the insensitivity group (P< 0.05); after acupuncture, PPT rate of change in the sensitivity group was higher than that in the insensitivity group (P< 0.05). The analyses revealed that there was a negative correlation between rCBF and VAS score for the right-sided anterior cingulate cortex in the insensitivity group and superior frontal gyrus in the sensitivity group (|r|>0.3 and P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Different sensitivity to acupuncture is one of the crucial factors influencing analgesia effects. The sensitivity group had superior analgesia effect than the insensitivity group. Acupuncture might deactivate cerebral functional areas to generate analgesic effects.The superior frontal gyrus and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, because of deactivation, play a positive role in sensitive patients, which is probably one of the CNS cerebral areas responding to acupuncture analgesia of people who are sensitive to acupuncture.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29888569,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 1.","BACKGROUND: Oxytocin (OT) and Vasopressin (AVP) are phylogenetically conserved neuropeptides with effects on social behavior, cognition and stress responses. Although OT and AVP are most commonly measured in blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), these approaches present an array of challenges including concerns related to the invasiveness of sample collection, the potential for matrix interference in immunoassays, and whether samples can be collected at precise time points to assess event-linked endocrine responses. NEW METHOD: We validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the measurement of salivary OT and AVP in domestic dogs. RESULTS: Both OT and AVP were present in dog saliva and detectable by ELISA and high performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). OT concentrations in dog saliva were much higher than those typically detected in humans. OT concentrations in the same samples analyzed with and without sample extraction were highly correlated, but this was not true for AVP. ELISA validation studies revealed good accuracy and parallelism, both with and without solid phase extraction. Collection of salivary samples with different synthetic swabs, or following salivary stimulation or the consumption of food led to variance in results. However, samples collected from the same dogs using different techniques tended to be positively correlated. We detected concurrent elevations in salivary and plasma OT during nursing. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: There are currently no other validated methods for measuring OT/AVP in dog saliva. CONCLUSIONS: OT and AVP are present in dog saliva, and ELISAs for their detection are methodologically valid.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28865986,N,no phys of interest,,,

According to this theory, pathological worry, as in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), is verbal in nature, negative and abstract, rather than concrete. Neuroimaging studies link the expression of worry to characteristic modes of brain functional connectivity, especially in relation to the amygdala. However, the distinctive features of worry (verbal, abstract, negative), and their relationship to physiological arousal, have not so far been mapped to brain function. Methods: We addressed this omission by undertaking a resting-state functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging study of 19 patients with GAD and 21 controls, before and after induction of perseverative cognitions, while measuring emotional bodily arousal from heart rate (HR). Seed-based analyses quantified brain changes in whole brain functional connectivity from the amygdala. Results: In GAD, the induction increased negative thoughts and their verbal content. In line with predictions, the verbal expression of worry in GAD was associated with higher HR at baseline and attenuated HR increases after induction of perseverative cognitions. Within brain, the increased use of words during worry, and the associated dampening of HR after induction were mediated by the strength of functional connectivity between the amygdala and default mode network 'hubs' and the opercular cortex. The negative content of worry was further related to functional communication between amygdala and cingulo-opercular and temporal cortices. Conclusions: Findings provide a neurobiological basis for the impact of verbal worry on HR in GAD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29527493,M,mediation,,,

However, it is currently unknown how a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention affects resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in motor networks. Previous work has shown that over a 6-month or 1-year exercise intervention, older individuals show increased resting state connectivity of the default mode network and the sensorimotor network (Voss et al., 2010b; Flodin et al., 2017). However, the effects of shorter-term 12-week exercise interventions on functional connectivity have received less attention. Method: Thirty-seven sedentary right-handed older adults were randomized to either a 12-week aerobic, spin cycling exercise group or a 12-week balance-toning exercise group. Resting state functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in sessions PRE/POST interventions. We applied seed-based correlation analysis to left and right primary motor cortices (L-M1 and R-M1) and anterior default mode network (aDMN) to test changes in rsFC between groups after the intervention. In addition, we performed a regression analysis predicting connectivity changes PRE/POST intervention across all participants as a function of time spent in aerobic training zone regardless of group assignment. Results: Seeding from L-M1, we found that participants in the cycling group had a greater PRE/POST change in rsFC in aDMN as compared to the balance group. When accounting for time in aerobic HR zone, we found increased heart rate workload was positively associated with increased change of rsFC between motor networks and aDMN. Interestingly, L-M1 to aDMN connectivity changes were also related to motor behavior changes in both groups. Respective of M1 laterality, comparisons of all participants from PRE to POST showed a reduction in the extent of bilateral M1 connectivity after the interventions with increased connectivity in dominant M1. Conclusion: A 12-week physical activity intervention can change rsFC between primary motor regions and default mode network areas, which may be associated with improved motor performance. The decrease in connectivity between L-M1 and R-M1 post-intervention may represent a functional consolidation to the dominant M1.

In this current study we used different analyses of BOLD fMRI responses to CO2 to provide a number of metrics including ramp and step CVR, speed of response and transfer function analysis (TFA). 51 healthy control volunteers between the ages of 18-85 (26 males) were recruited and scanned at 3T field strength. Atlases reflecting voxel-wise means and standard deviations were compiled to assess possible differences in these metrics between four age cohorts. Testing was carried out using an automated computer-controlled gas blender to induce hypercapnia in a step and ramp paradigm, and monitoring end-tidal partial pressures of CO2 (PETCO2) and O2 (PETO2). No significant differences were found for resting PETCO2 values between cohorts. Ramp CVR decreased significantly with age in white matter frontal regions comprising the ACA-MCA watershed area, a finding that may be indicative of age related changes. Similarly, TFA showed that gain was reduced in the left white matter ACA-MCA watershed area as well as the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, and superior frontal gyrus in the oldest compared to youngest cohort.

Epub 2018 Apr 22.","The locus coeruleus (LC) has established functions in both attention and respiration. Good attentional performance requires optimal levels of tonic LC activity, and must be matched to task consistently. LC neurons are chemosensitive, causing respiratory phrenic nerve firing to increase frequency with higher CO2 levels, and as CO2 level varies with the phase of respiration, tonic LC activity should exhibit fluctuations at respiratory frequency. Top-down modulation of tonic LC activity from brain areas involved in attentional regulation, intended to optimize LC firing to suit task requirements, may have respiratory consequences as well, as increases in LC activity influence phrenic nerve firing. We hypothesize that, due to the physiological and functional overlaps of attentional and respiratory functions of the LC, this small neuromodulatory nucleus is ideally situated to act as a mechanism of synchronization between respiratory and attentional systems, giving rise to a low-amplitude oscillation that enables attentional flexibility, but may also contribute to unintended destabilization of attention. Meditative and pranayama practices result in attentional, emotional, and physiological enhancements that may be partially due to the LC's pivotal role as the nexus in this coupled system. We present original findings of synchronization between respiration and LC activity (via fMRI and pupil dilation) and provide evidence of a relationship between respiratory phase modulation and attentional performance. We also present a mathematical dynamical systems model of respiratory-LC-attentional coupling, review candidate neurophysiological mechanisms of changes in coupling dynamics, and discuss implications for attentional theory, meditation, and pranayama, and possible therapeutic applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682753,N,no coords,,,

Clinical studies demonstrated that application of the stress hormone cortisol before exposure sessions facilitates exposure success, but the underlying neural correlates remain unknown. Context- and stimulus-dependent cortisol effects on extinction learning will be characterized in this study and tested in the extinction and in a new context. Forty healthy men participated in a 3-day fear conditioning experiment with fear acquisition in context A (day 1), extinction training in context B (day 2), and recall in context B and a new context C one week later (day 3). Hydrocortisone (30 mg) or placebo was given before extinction training. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses and skin conductance responses (SCRs) served as dependent measures. At the beginning of extinction training, cortisol reduced conditioned SCRs, diminished activation of the amygdala-hippocampal complex, and enhanced functional connectivity of the anterior parahippocampal gyrus with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). After one week, the cortisol group showed increased hippocampal activation and connectivity to the vmPFC toward an extinguished stimulus and reduced insula activation toward a nonextinguished stimulus in the extinction context. However, this inhibitory cortisol effect did not extend to the new context. Taken together, cortisol reduced fear recall at the beginning of extinction and facilitated the consolidation of the extinction memory as evidenced by an inhibitory activation pattern one week later. The stress hormone exerted a critical impact on the amygdala-hippocampus-vmPFC network underlying fear and extinction memories.

METHOD: Forty-four patients with bipolar disorder in full or partial remission were randomized to eight weekly erythropoietin (EPO; 40 000 IU) or saline (NaCl 0.9%) infusions in a double-blind, parallel-group design.

Epub 2017 Oct 19.","PURPOSE: A growing number of research studies have implicated the cerebellum in emotional processing and regulation, especially with regard to negative emotional memories. However, there currently are no studies showing functional changes in the cerebellum as a result of treatment for traumatic stress symptoms. The Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) is an intervention designed to help improve symptoms related to traumatic stress using an integrative approach that combines emotional, cognitive, and motor processing, with a particular focus on autonomic nervous system regulation. In this study, we evaluated whether the NET intervention alters functional connectivity in the brain of patients with traumatic stress symptoms associated with a cancer-related event. We hypothesized that the NET intervention would reduce emotional and autonomic reactivity and that this would correlate with connectivity changes between the cerebellum and limbic structures as well as the brain stem. METHODS: We enrolled patients with a prior cancer diagnosis who experienced distressing cancer-related memories associated with traumatic stress symptoms of at least 6 months in duration. Participants were randomized to either the NET intervention or a waitlist control. To evaluate the primary outcome of neurophysiological effects, all participants received resting-state functional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) before and after the NET intervention. In addition, autonomic reactivity was measured using heart rate response to the traumatic stimulus. Pre/post comparisons were performed between the NET and control groups. RESULTS: The results demonstrated significant changes in the NET group, as compared to the control group, in the functional connectivity between the cerebellum (including the vermis) and the amygdala, parahippocampus, and brain stem. Likewise, participants receiving the NET intervention had significant reductions in autonomic reactivity based on heart rate response to the traumatic stimulus compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an initial step towards establishing a neurological signature of treatment effect for the NET intervention. Specifically, functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the amygdala and prefrontal cortex appear to be associated with a reduction in autonomic reactivity in response to distressing cancer-related memories.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate cerebral activity in response to rectal distension in adolescents with FC and FNRFI compared with healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: We included 15 adolescents with FC, 10 adolescents with FNRFI, and 15 young adult HCs. Rectal barostat was performed prior to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine individual pressure thresholds for urge sensation. Subjects received 2 sessions of 5 x 30 seconds of barostat stimulation during the acquisition of blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signal differences were analyzed using SPM8 in Matlab. KEY RESULTS: Functional constipation and FNRFI patients had higher thresholds for urgency than HCs (P < .001). During rectal distension, FC patients showed activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and putamen. No activations were observed in controls and FNRFI patients. Functional nonretentive fecal incontinence patients showed deactivation in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus (FFG), lingual gyrus, posterior parietal cortex, and precentral gyrus. In HCs, deactivated areas were detected in the hippocampus, amygdala, FFG, insula, thalamus, precuneus, and primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, no regions with significant deactivation were detected in FC patients.

Epub 2018 Feb 10.","The defense of body temperature against environmental thermal challenges is a core objective of homeostatic regulation governed by the autonomic nervous system. Autonomous mechanisms of thermoregulation are only weakly affected by top-down modulation, allowing only transient tolerance for extreme cold. There is however, anecdotal evidence of a unique set of individuals known for extreme cold tolerance. Here we present a case study of a 57-year old Dutch national, Wim Hof, the so-called ""Iceman"", with the ability to withstand frequent prolonged periods of extreme cold exposure based on the practice of a self-developed technique involving a combination of forced breathing, cold exposure and meditation (collectively referred to as the Wim Hof Method, henceforth ""WHM""). The relative contributions of the brain and the periphery that endow the Iceman with these capabilities is unknown. To investigate this, we conducted multi-modal imaging assessments of the brain and the periphery using a combination of fMRI and PET/CT imaging. Thermoregulatory defense was evoked by subjecting the Iceman (and a cohort of typical controls) to a fMRI paradigm designed to generate periods of mild hypothermia interspersed by periods of return to basal core body temperature. fMRI was acquired in two separate sessions: in a typical (passive) state and following the practice of WHM. In addition, the Iceman also underwent a whole body PET/CT imaging session using the tracers C11-hydroxyephedrine (HED) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) during both thermoneutral and prolonged mild cold conditions. This acquisition allowed us to determine changes in sympathetic innervation (HED) and glucose consumption (FDG) in muscle and fat tissues in the absence of the WHM. fMRI analyses indicated that the WHM activates primary control centers for descending pain/cold stimuli modulation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), possibly initiating a stress-induced analgesic response. In addition, the WHM also engages higher-order cortical areas (left anterior and right middle insula) that are uniquely associated with self-reflection, and which facilitate both internal focus and sustained attention in the presence of averse (e.g. cold) external stimuli. However, the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was unremarkable. Finally, forceful respiration results in increased sympathetic innervation and glucose consumption in intercostal muscle, generating heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms circulating blood in the pulmonary capillaries. Our results provide compelling evidence for the primacy of the brain (CNS) rather than the body (peripheral mechanisms) in mediating the Iceman's responses to cold exposure. They also suggest the compelling possibility that the WHM might allow practitioners to develop higher level of control over key components of the autonomous system, with implications for lifestyle interventions that might ameliorate multiple clinical syndromes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29438845,N,no brain data,,,

Epub 2017 Sep 7.","BACKGROUND: Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are hyperresponsive to unexpected or potentially threatening environmental stimuli. Research in lower animals and humans suggests that sensitization of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system may underlie behavioral and autonomic hyperresponsiveness in PTSD. However, direct evidence linking locus coeruleus system hyperactivity to PTSD hyperresponsiveness is sparse. METHODS: Psychophysiological recording and functional magnetic resonance imaging were used during passive listening to brief, 95-dB sound pressure level, white noise bursts presented intermittently to determine whether behavioral and autonomic hyperresponsiveness to sudden sounds in PTSD is associated with locus coeruleus hyperresponsiveness. RESULTS: Participants with PTSD (n = 28) showed more eye-blink reflexes and larger heart rate, skin conductance, and pupil area responses to loud sounds (multivariate p = .007) compared with trauma-exposed participants without PTSD (n = 26). PTSD participants exhibited larger responses in locus coeruleus (t = 2.60, region of interest familywise error corrected), intraparietal sulcus, caudal dorsal premotor cortex, and cerebellar lobule VI (t >/= 4.18, whole-brain familywise error corrected). Caudal dorsal premotor cortex activity was associated with both psychophysiological response magnitude and levels of exaggerated startle responses in daily life in PTSD participants (t >/= 4.39, whole-brain familywise error corrected). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and autonomic hyperresponsiveness in PTSD may arise from a hyperactive alerting/orienting system in which processes related to attention and motor preparation localized to lateral premotor cortex, intraparietal sulcus, and posterior superior cerebellar cortex are modulated by atypically high phasic noradrenergic influences originating in the locus coeruleus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100627,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Even spontaneous physiological signal fluctuations have been shown to influence the BOLD fMRI signal in a regionally specific manner. Consequently, estimates of functional connectivity between different brain regions, performed when the subject is at rest, may be confounded by the effects of physiological signal fluctuations. In addition, resting functional connectivity has been shown to vary with respect to time (dynamic functional connectivity - DFC), with the sources of this variation not fully elucidated. The effect of physiological factors on dynamic (time-varying) resting-state functional connectivity has not been studied extensively, to our knowledge. In our previous study, we investigated the effect of heart rate (HR) and end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) on the time-varying network degree of three well-described RSNs (DMN, SMN and Visual Network) using mask-based and seed-based analysis, and we identified brain-heart interactions which were more pronounced in specific frequency bands. Here, we extend this work, by estimating DFC and its corresponding network degree for the RSNs, employing a data-driven approach to extract the RSNs (low-and high-dimensional Independent Component Analysis (ICA)), which we subsequently correlate with the characteristics of simultaneously collected physiological signals. The results confirm that physiological signals have a modulatory effect on resting-state, fMRI-based DFC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30440564,N,methods paper,,,

The present experiment employed a self-paced category learning task and fMRI to examine the neural mechanisms underlying stopping of information search and how they contribute to choice accuracy. Participants learned to classify triads of face, object, and scene cues into one of two categories using a rule based on one of the stimulus dimensions. After each trial, participants were given the option to explicitly solve the rule or continue learning. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to examine activation of rule-relevant information on trials leading up to a decision to solve the rule. We found that activation of rule-relevant information increased leading up to participants' stopping decisions. Stopping was associated with widespread activation that included medial prefrontal cortex and visual association areas. Engagement of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was associated with accurate stopping, and activation in this region was functionally coupled with signal in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Results suggest that activating rule information when deciding whether to stop an information search increases choice accuracy, and that the response profile of vmPFC during such decisions may provide an index of effective learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410293,N,no phys of interest,,,

The underlying neural mechanisms remain uncertain, yet arterial baroreceptor signaling, occurring at cardiac systole, is implicated. We examined normotensives using functional neuroimaging and pain stimulation during distinct phases of the cardiac cycle to test the hypothesized neural mediation of baroreceptor-induced attenuation of pain. METHODS: Eighteen participants (10 women; 32.7 (6.5) years) underwent BP monitoring for 1 week at home, and individual pain thresholds were determined in the laboratory. Subsequently, participants were administered unpredictable painful and nonpainful electrocutaneous shocks (stimulus type), timed to occur either at systole or at diastole (cardiac phase) in an event-related design. After each trial, participants evaluated their subjective experience. RESULTS: Subjective pain was lower for painful stimuli administered at systole compared with diastole, F(1, 2283) = 4.82, p = 0.03. Individuals with higher baseline BP demonstrated overall lower pain perception, F(1, 2164) = 10.47, p < .0001. Within the brain, painful stimulation activated somatosensory areas, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, posterior insula, amygdala, and the thalamus. Stimuli delivered during systole (concurrent with baroreceptor discharge) activated areas associated with heightened parasympathetic drive. No stimulus type by cardiac phase interaction emerged except for a small cluster located in the right parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the negative associations between BP and pain, highlighting the antinociceptive impact of baroreceptor discharge. Neural substrates associated with baroreceptor/BP-related hypoalgesia include superior parietal lobule, precentral, and lingual gyrus, regions typically involved in the cognitive aspects of pain experience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29595708,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2018 Apr 25.","To investigate a potential contribution of systemic physiology to recently reported BOLD fMRI signals in white matter, we compared photo-plethysmography (PPG) and whole-brain fMRI signals recorded simultaneously during long resting-state scans from an overnight sleep study. We found that intermittent drops in the amplitude of the PPG signal exhibited strong and widespread correlations with the fMRI signal, both in white matter (WM) and in gray matter (GM). The WM signal pattern resembled that seen in previous resting-state fMRI studies and closely tracked the location of medullary veins. Its temporal cross-correlation with the PPG amplitude was bipolar, with an early negative value. In GM, the correlation was consistently positive. Consistent with previous studies comparing physiological signals with fMRI, these findings point to a systemic vascular contribution to WM fMRI signals. The PPG drops are interpreted as systemic vasoconstrictive events, possibly related to intermittent increases in sympathetic tone related to fluctuations in arousal state. The counter-intuitive polarity of the WM signal is explained by long blood transit times in the medullary vasculature of WM, which cause blood oxygenation loss and a substantial timing mismatch between blood volume and blood oxygenation effects. A similar mechanism may explain previous findings of negative WM signals around large draining veins during both task- and resting-state fMRI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704614,N,methods paper,,,

Epub 2018 Feb 12.","Functional connectivity techniques are commonplace tools for studying brain organization. A critical element of these analyses is to distinguish variance due to neurobiological signals from variance due to nonneurobiological signals. Multiecho fMRI techniques are a promising means for making such distinctions based on signal decay properties. Here, we report that multiecho fMRI techniques enable excellent removal of certain kinds of artifactual variance, namely, spatially focal artifacts due to motion. By removing these artifacts, multiecho techniques reveal frequent, large-amplitude blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes present across all gray matter that are also linked to motion. These whole-brain BOLD signals could reflect widespread neural processes or other processes, such as alterations in blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) due to ventilation changes. By acquiring multiecho data while monitoring breathing, we demonstrate that whole-brain BOLD signals in the resting state are often caused by changes in breathing that co-occur with head motion. These widespread respiratory fMRI signals cannot be isolated from neurobiological signals by multiecho techniques because they occur via the same BOLD mechanism. Respiratory signals must therefore be removed by some other technique to isolate neurobiological covariance in fMRI time series. Several methods for removing global artifacts are demonstrated and compared, and were found to yield fMRI time series essentially free of motion-related influences. These results identify two kinds of motion-associated fMRI variance, with different physical mechanisms and spatial profiles, each of which strongly and differentially influences functional connectivity patterns. Distance-dependent patterns in covariance are nearly entirely attributable to non-BOLD artifacts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440410,N,methods paper,,,

Epub 2017 Dec 16.","People's sensitivity to first-hand pain is affected by their ongoing emotions, with positive states (joy, amusement) exerting analgesic-like effects, and negative states (sadness, fear) often enhancing the subjective experience. It is however less clear how empathetic responses to others' pain are affected by one's own emotional state. Following embodied accounts that posit a shared representational code between self and others' states, it is plausible that pain empathy might be influenced by emotions in the same way as first-hand pain. Alternatively, other theories in psychology suggest that social resources (including empathetic reactions) might be enhanced by positive states, but inhibited by negative states, as only in the former case, one's mindset is sufficiently broad to take into consideration others' needs. To disambiguate between these opposing predictions, we conducted two experiments in which volunteers observed positive, neutral, or negative video clips, and subsequently either received painful thermal stimuli on their own body (first-hand pain), or observed images of wounded hands (others' pain). We measured subjective pain ratings as well as physiological responses and brain activity using fMRI. We found that, contrary to the case of first-hand pain, others' pain produced weaker galvanic responses and lower neural activity in anterior insula and middle cingulate cortex following negative (relative to neutral and positive) videos. Such inhibition was partially counteracted by personal empathy traits, as individuals with higher scores retained greater sensitivity to others' pain after negative emotion induction, in both behavioral and neural responses in medial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, multivoxel pattern analysis confirmed similar neural representation for first-hand and others' pain in anterior insula, with representation similarity increasing the more the video preceding the observation of others' suffering was positive. These findings speak against the idea that emotion induction affects first-hand and others' pain in an isomorphic way, but rather supports the idea that contrary to negative emotions, positive emotions favors a broader access to social resources.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258849,N,no phys of interest,,,

Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that there is reduced communication between deactivated regions during OM chanting. In order to do so, we employed multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR) based Granger causality to obtain directional connectivity between deactivated regions. fMRI scans of 12 right handed healthy volunteers (9 Men) from a previously published study was used in which participants performed OM chanting and a control condition in a block design. We found that outputs from insula, anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices were significantly reduced in OM condition. Of interest is the reduction of outputs from these regions to limbic area amygdala.

The network is characterized by a precise temporal sequence of activations within a gastric cycle, beginning with somato-motor cortices and ending with the extrastriate body area and dorsal precuneus.

Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the complexity of the heart-brain two-way dynamic interactions. HRV entropy analysis quantifies the unpredictability and complexity of the heart rate beats intervals. We here investigate the complexity index (CI), a score of HRV complexity by aggregating the non-linear multi-scale entropies over a range of time scales, and its discriminative power in chronic patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), and its relation to brain functional connectivity. Methods: We investigated the CI in short (CIs) and long (CIl) time scales in 14 UWS and 16 MCS sedated. CI for MCS and UWS groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney exact test. Spearman's correlation tests were conducted between the Coma Recovery Scale-revised (CRS-R) and both CI. Discriminative power of both CI was assessed with One-R machine learning model. Correlation between CI and brain connectivity (detected with functional magnetic resonance imagery using seed-based and hypothesis-free intrinsic connectivity) was investigated using a linear regression in a subgroup of 10 UWS and 11 MCS patients with sufficient image quality. Results: Higher CIs and CIl values were observed in MCS compared to UWS. Positive correlations were found between CRS-R and both CI. The One-R classifier selected CIl as the best discriminator between UWS and MCS with 90% accuracy, 7% false positive and 13% false negative rates after a 10-fold cross-validation test. Positive correlations were observed between both CI and the recovery of functional connectivity of brain areas belonging to the central autonomic networks (CAN). Conclusion: CI of MCS compared to UWS patients has high discriminative power and low false negative rate at one third of the estimated human assessors' misdiagnosis, providing an easy, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tool. CI reflects functional connectivity changes in the CAN, suggesting that CI can provide an indirect way to screen and monitor connectivity changes in this neural system.

The objective of this study was to determine whether systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly associated with cognitive functioning in non-demented adults, and to examine in vivo AD pathology as a possible mediator of this association. METHODS: Positron emission tomography (PET) scans with 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) provide in vivo measurements of plaque and tangle burden. A total of 101 non-demented older subjects with blood pressure data and FDDNP-PET scans were drawn from a larger study of predictors of cognitive decline. A neuropsychological test battery was used to compute ""global cognitive scores"" (averaged across five key domains), which served as an index of general cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Higher DBP (but not SBP) was significantly associated with lower cognitive scores, controlling for age, sex, antihypertensive medication use, and ApoE genotype (eta(2) = 0.06). However, this relationship was no longer significant after introducing FDDNP-PET binding as an additional covariate in the statistical models. In vivo plaque and tangle burden accounted for over 30% of the observed association between higher DBP and poorer cognitive performance.

These regions included the cingulate cortex, premotor areas, primary sensorimotor cortices, the parietal operculum, and the supplementary motor area. Psychophysical interaction analyses revealed increased functional connectivity between the same regions and the aMCC during drinking behavior in the thirsty condition. Functional connectivity during drinking behavior was also greater for the thirsty condition relative to the oversated condition between the aMCC and two subcortical regions, the cerebellum and the rostroventral medulla, the latter containing nuclei responsible for the swallowing reflex. Finally, during drinking behavior in the oversated condition, ratings of swallowing effort showed a negative association with functional connectivity between the aMCC and two cortical regions, the sensorimotor cortex and the supramarginal gyrus. The results of this study provide evidence that the aMCC helps facilitate swallowing during a state of thirst and is therefore likely to contribute to the regulation of drinking after dehydration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29311314,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, no specific neurocognitive impairment has yet been proposed as a core deficit underlying such symptoms. We aimed to determine whether MS patients present changes in interoception-that is, the monitoring of autonomic bodily information-a process that might be related to various bodily dysfunctions. We performed two studies in 34 relapsing-remitting, early-stage MS patients and 46 controls matched for gender, age, and education. In Study 1, we evaluated the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a cortical signature of interoception, via a 128-channel EEG system during a heartbeat detection task including an exteroceptive and an interoceptive condition. Then, we obtained whole-brain MRI recordings. In Study 2, participants underwent fMRI recordings during two resting-state conditions: mind wandering and interoception. In Study 1, controls exhibited greater HEP modulation during the interoceptive condition than the exteroceptive one, but no systematic differences between conditions emerged in MS patients. Patients presented atrophy in the left insula, the posterior part of the right insula, and the right anterior cingulate cortex, with abnormal associations between neurophysiological and neuroanatomical patterns. In Study 2, controls showed higher functional connectivity and degree for the interoceptive state compared with mind wandering; however, this pattern was absent in patients, who nonetheless presented greater connectivity and degree than controls during mind wandering. MS patients were characterized by atypical multimodal brain signatures of interoception. This finding opens a new agenda to examine the role of inner-signal monitoring in the body symptomatology of MS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30076770,N,FC,,,

To overcome the low temporal resolution of fMRI, we used a novel ERP-based application of multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) to parse time-averaged fMRI pattern activity into distinct spatial maps that each corresponded, in representational structure, to a short temporal ERP segment. Discriminant analysis of ERP-fMRI correlations revealed 8 cortical networks-2 sensory, 3 attention, and 3 other-segregated by 4 orthogonal, temporally multifaceted and spatially distributed functions.

Epub 2018 Jul 17.","BACKGROUND: Postoperative cervical hemorrhage is a rare but life-threatening complication that can cause severe morbidity. Different mechanisms leading to asphyxia have been described based only on clinical observation. METHODS: We performed a series of in vivo animal studies simulating post-thyroidectomy hemorrhage and its effect on respiratory drive. Three series of tests were carried out in 12 German domestic pigs under general anesthesia. The pigs were breathing spontaneously with secured airways. An additional series using functional magnetic resonance imaging of the pigs' brainstem was also conducted. RESULTS: The first experimental series carried out on 2 animals revealed an obvious difference between the effects of cervical hemorrhage and external bleeding with development of hemorrhagic shock. An experimental setting for the repeated simulation of cervical hemorrhage was established. A pressure-dependent mechanism was discovered that led to apnea in every animal despite the secured airway. In 8 of 10 animals, relief of cervical pressure led to complete respiratory recovery. The test was repeated up to 6 times per pig. Apnea was induced in 25 of 25 test procedures (100%) and was followed by respiratory recovery in 22 of 25 tests (88%). The threshold pressure at which the respiratory rate started to decrease was 47 +/- 14 Torr when blood was used to increase the cervical compartment pressure. When silicone oil was used in a further experimental series, the threshold pressure was similar at 44 +/- 21 Torr. The cervical compartment pressure needed to induce apnea was 74 +/- 18 Torr using blood and 74 +/- 39 Torr using silicone oil, both of which exceeded the mean arterial pressure by 28 Torr during apnea. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a decrease in brainstem activity during phases of increased cervical compartment pressure, which suggests a possible role for cerebral vascular perfusion. CONCLUSION: Respiratory drive can be suppressed by increased pressure in the cervical compartment, possibly because of a pressure-dependent impairment in cerebral perfusion through a form of cervical compartment phenomenon or, less likely, a pressure-dependent reflex (nervous) mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30029990,N,no brain data,,,

To advance the localization in this area, precise functional imaging is fundamental. In this study, we used a sophisticated fMRI technique as well as physiological recordings to investigate the involvement of brainstem/midbrain nuclei in cognitive control during a Stroop task. The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) increased due to physiological noise correction (PNC) especially in regions adjacent to arteries and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the brainstem/cerebellum template an average tSNR of 68 +/- 16 was achieved after the simultaneous application of a high-resolution fMRI, specialized co-registration, and PNC. The analysis of PNC data revealed an activation of the substantia nigra in the Stroop interference contrast whereas no significant results were obtained in the midbrain or brainstem when analyzing uncorrected data. Additionally, we found that pupil size indicated the level of cognitive effort. The Stroop interference effect on pupillary responses was correlated to the effect on reaction times (R (2) = 0.464, p < 0.05). When Stroop stimuli were modulated by pupillary responses, we observed a significant activation of the LC in the Stroop interference contrast. Thus, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of PNC on data quality and statistical results when analyzing neuronal responses to a cognitive task. Parametric modulation of task events with pupillary responses improved the model of LC BOLD activations in the Stroop interference contrast.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30386203,Y,corr,uns,#ERROR!,

We compared activation of fear and extinction networks between insomnia disorder (ID) without comorbidity and good sleepers (GS). Methods: Twenty-three ID participants age- and sex-matched to 23 GS participants completed 14 days of actigraphy and diaries, three nights of ambulatory polysomnography and a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Fear conditioning and extinction learning occurred on the first day, followed 24 hours later by extinction recall. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal and skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded. Nineteen participants per group produced usable fMRI data. Beta weights from areas where activation differed between groups were regressed against sleep and psychophysiological measures. SCR was compared between groups at various stages of the paradigm. Results: During fear conditioning, both ID (N = 19) and GS (N = 19) activated fear-related structures. Across extinction learning, ID (N = 19) demonstrated little change, whereas GS (N = 16) activated both fear and extinction-related areas, including the hippocampus, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), and ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) cortices. During extinction recall, while GS (N = 17) demonstrated limited activation, ID (N = 16) activated regions similar to those previously activated in GS (vmPFC, dACC, insula). Sleep quality was predictive of activations seen at various stages of the paradigm. SCR data suggested ID were more physiologically reactive than GS. Conclusions: Across extinction learning, GS but not ID activated both fear and extinction-related networks. At extinction recall, ID engaged similar regions whereas GS no longer did so.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides inhibitory control over the amygdala during ER. Previous studies linked vmHRV with activity in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) during implicit ER. To date no study examined the relation between vmHRV and brain activity during explicit ER. vmHRV was measured during a 7 min baseline at T1 2-5 days preceding T2. At T2 n = 24 participants (50% female, M age = 24.6 years) viewed neutral or emotional pictures of pleasant or unpleasant valence and were instructed to intensify or to reduce their present emotion using two ER strategies (reappraisal and response modulation) or to passively view the picture. Participants rated the valence of their emotional state from pleasant to unpleasant after ER. Whole-brain fMRI data were collected using a 1.5-T-scanner. We observed an association between resting state vmHRV and brain activation in the PFC and the amygdala during ER of unpleasant emotions. Groups based on vmHRV showed significant differences in the modulation of amygdala activity as a function of ER strategy. In participants with high vmHRV amygdala activity was modulated only when using reappraisal and for low vmHRV participants only when using response modulation. Similar, dorsomedial PFC activity in high vmHRV participants was increased when using reappraisal and in low vmHRV participants when using response modulation to regulate unpleasant emotions. These results suggest that individuals with low vmHRV might have difficulties in recruiting prefrontal brain areas necessary for the modulation of amygdala activity during explicit ER.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455624,N,no phys of interest,,,

Configural threat learning is a hippocampal-dependent process of forming a conjunctive representation of a context through binding of several multi-modal elements. In contrast, elemental threat-learning is governed by the amygdala and involves forming associative relationships between individual features within the context. Contextual learning tasks in humans however, rarely probe if a learned fear response is truly due to configural learning vs. simple elemental associations. The aim of the current study was to probe both constructs separately to enable a more refined interpretation of configural vs. elemental threat learning performance and mediating circuits. Subjects (n=25) performed both a novel feature-identical contextual threat conditioning task and a discrete cue threat acquisition task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results demonstrated increased hippocampus activity for the threat configuration compared to the safe configuration. This pattern was not observed in the amygdala. In contrast, elemental threat learning was associated with increased amygdala, but not hippocampus activity. Whole-brain analyses revealed that both configural and elemental threat acquisition share neural circuitry related to fear expression.

Previous studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have indicated that in addition to reactive responses to nociceptive signals, there is a continuous component to regulation, and that it may vary with differences in pain sensitivity. We hypothesize that this continuous regulation component occurs routinely in fMRI studies before noxious stimulation, as well as during, and after stimulation. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing data from 59 healthy participants in 4 previous fMRI studies in our laboratory using noxious heat stimuli. Analyses included structural equation modeling to identify coordinated blood oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variations between regions (ie, connectivity) and Bayesian regression of BOLD time-series responses in relation to pain ratings and stimulus temperatures. The results demonstrate the periaqueductal gray-rostral ventromedial medulla-spinal cord descending modulation pathway, influenced by input from the hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Connectivity between specific regions is observed to vary in relation to pain sensitivity. The results support the conclusion that homeostatic autonomic control influences the net descending pain regulation, and therefore influences pain sensitivity. The results describe the overall properties of pain processing (specifically pain elicited by heat) in the healthy human brainstem and spinal cord, and mechanisms for variation across individuals. This understanding is expected to be important for studies of how pain processing is altered in chronic pain conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29905656,N,no phys of interest,,,

Here we examined how within-network connectivity relates to individual differences in human (including males and females) baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous activity. We measured resting autonomic nervous system physiology in 24 healthy controls and 23 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by baseline autonomic deficits. Participants also underwent structural and task-free fMRI. First, we used voxel-based morphometry to determine whether salience network atrophy was associated with lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (a sympathetic measure) in bvFTD. Next, we examined whether functional connectivity deficits in 21 autonomic-relevant, salience network node-pairs related to baseline autonomic dysfunction. Lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia was associated with smaller volume in left ventral anterior insula (vAI), weaker connectivity between bilateral vAI and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and stronger connectivity between bilateral ACC and bilateral hypothalamus/amygdala. Lower baseline skin conductance level, in contrast, was associated with smaller volume in inferior temporal gyrus, dorsal mid-insula, and hypothalamus; weaker connectivity between bilateral ACC and right hypothalamus/amygdala; and stronger connectivity between bilateral dorsal anterior insula and periaqueductal gray. Our results suggest that baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic tone depends on the integrity of lateralized salience network hubs (left vAI for parasympathetic and right hypothalamus/amygdala for sympathetic) and highly calibrated ipsilateral and contralateral network connections. In bvFTD, deficits in this system may underlie resting parasympathetic and sympathetic disruption.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The salience network maintains homeostasis and regulates autonomic nervous system activity. Whether within-network connectivity patterns underlie individual differences in resting parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, however, is not well understood. We measured baseline autonomic nervous system activity in healthy controls and patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by resting autonomic deficits, and probed how salience network dysfunction relates to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow. Our results indicate that baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic tone are the product of complex, opposing intranetwork nodal interactions and depend on the integrity of highly tuned, lateralized salience network hubs (i.e., left ventral anterior insula for parasympathetic activity and right hypothalamus/amygdala for sympathetic activity).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181137,N,FC study,,,

Participants demonstrated learning with shock expectancy ratings and skin conductance increases for flowers in the danger zone. Patterns of brain activity shifted between overlapping networks during different task stages.

Threat appraisal, during approach in the danger zone, engaged the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), with insula-hippocampal functional connectivity. During imminent threat, after picking a flower, this pattern was supplemented by activity in periaqueductal gray (PAG), insula-dACC coupling, and posterior hippocampal activity that increased with experience. We interpret these patterns in terms of multiple representations of spatial context (anterior hippocampus); specific locations (posterior hippocampus); stimuli (amygdala); value (vmPFC); threat, both visceral (insula) and cognitive (dACC); and defensive behaviors (PAG), interacting in different combinations to perform the functions required at each task stage.

Close relationships were established between subjective CS/UCS association and activations in the primary visual cortex (V1) during the early phase of conditioning and in the striatum during the late conditioning phase. In addition, we observed inverse relationships between subjective CS/UCS association and both V1/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatal/vmPFC connectivity.

Currently, exposure therapy is among the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders, but this intervention is subjectively aversive to patients, causing many to drop out of treatment prematurely. Here we introduce a method to bypass the subjective unpleasantness in conscious exposure, by directly pairing monetary reward with unconscious occurrences of decoded representations of naturally feared animals in the brain. To decode physiological fear representations without triggering excessively aversive reactions, we capitalize on recent advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging decoding techniques, and use a method called hyperalignment to infer the relevant representations of feared animals for a designated participant based on data from other ""surrogate"" participants. In this way, the procedure completely bypasses the need for a conscious encounter with feared animals. We demonstrate that our method can lead to reliable reductions in physiological fear responses, as measured by skin conductance as well as amygdala hemodynamic activity. Not only do these results raise the intriguing possibility that naturally occurring fear responses can be ""reprogrammed"" outside of conscious awareness, importantly, they also create the rare opportunity to rigorously test a psychological intervention of this nature in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion.

RESULTS: Individual-delay yielded superior model fit or larger cluster volumes. Regional analysis found differences in CVR and time-to-peak CVR. Males had higher brain-wide CVR in comparison to females (p=0.025, eta(2)part=0.345). BMI and blood pressure were not significantly associated with CVR (all p>0.4). COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: This was the first study to compare these methods in youth. Regional differences were similar to adult studies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings lend support to future breath-hold CVR studies in youth, and highlight the merit of applying individualized-delay estimates. Regional variability and sex-related differences in CVR suggest that these variables should be considered in future studies, particularly those that examine disease states with predilection for specific brain regions or those diseases characterized by sex differences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879447,N,cvr study,,,

Epub 2017 Nov 16.","BACKGROUND: Tumour hypoxia is associated with increased radioresistance and poor response to radiotherapy. Pre-treatment assessment of tumour oxygenation could therefore give the possibility to tailor the treatment by calculating the required boost dose needed to overcome the increased radioresistance in hypoxic tumours. This study concerned the derivation of a non-linear conversion function between the uptake of the hypoxia-PET tracer (18)F-HX4 and oxygen partial pressure (pO2). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Building on previous experience with FMISO including experimental data on tracer uptake and pO2, tracer-specific model parameters were derived for converting the normalised HX4-uptake at the optimal imaging time point to pO2. The conversion function was implemented in a Python-based computational platform utilising the scripting and the registration modules of the treatment planning system RayStation. Subsequently, the conversion function was applied to determine the pO2 in eight non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients imaged with HX4-PET before the start of radiotherapy. Automatic segmentation of hypoxic target volumes (HTVs) was then performed using thresholds around 10 mmHg. The HTVs were compared to sub-volumes segmented based on a tumour-to-blood ratio (TBR) of 1.4 using the aortic arch as the reference oxygenated region. The boost dose required to achieve 95% local control was then calculated based on the calibrated levels of hypoxia, assuming inter-fraction reoxygenation due to changes in acute hypoxia but no overall improvement of the oxygenation status. RESULTS: Using the developed conversion tool, HTVs could be obtained using pO2 a threshold of 10 mmHg which were in agreement with the TBR segmentation. The dose levels required to the HTVs to achieve local control were feasible, being around 70-80 Gy in 24 fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Non-linear conversion of tracer uptake to pO2 in NSCLC imaged with HX4-PET allows a quantitative determination of the dose-boost needed to achieve a high probability of local control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29141489,N,no phys of interest,,,

The acquisition of these conditioned responses has been well characterized in laboratory animals: neutral stimuli paired with drugs elicit conditioned responses resembling the motivational and incentive properties of the drug itself. However, few studies have examined acquisition of conditioning, or the nature of the conditioned response, in humans. In this study, we used fMRI to examine neural responses to stimuli that had been paired with methamphetamine or placebo in healthy young adults. Participants first underwent four conditioning sessions in which visual-auditory stimuli were paired with either methamphetamine (20 mg, oral) or placebo. Then on a drug-free test day, the stimuli were presented during an fMRI scan to assess neural responses to the stimuli. We hypothesized that the stimuli would elicit drug-like brain activity, especially in regions related to reward. Instead, we found that the methamphetamine-paired stimuli, compared to placebo-paired stimuli, produced greater activation in regions related to visual and auditory processing, consistent with the drug's unconditioned effects on sensory processing. This is the first study to demonstrate conditioned neural responses to drug-paired stimuli after just two pairings of methamphetamine in healthy adults. The study also illustrates that conditioned responses may develop to unexpected components of the drug's effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463908,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 20.","PURPOSE: Study purpose was to investigate the effects of bariatric surgery on intraocular pressure (IOP) and other ophthalmic parameters in a prospective observational follow-up study. METHODS: Ophthalmic examination was performed on 22 obese women before and 6 months after bariatric surgery. A control group of 15 non-obese age-matched women were studied twice 6 months apart. IOP was measured with the Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) and the Pascal dynamic contour tonometer (PDCT). None of the subjects had glaucoma. RESULTS: Average weight loss 6 months after bariatric surgery was 25 +/-8 kg, (p < 0.05). Visual acuity (VA), pachymetry and systolic as well as diastolic blood pressures did not differ between the obese and control groups and no change between the visits was detected. At baseline, IOP was significantly higher in the obese group than in the controls (16.6 +/- 3.0 mmHg GAT and 18.1 +/- 2.2 mmHg PDCT compared with 14.3 +/- 1.5 mmHg GAT and 16.5 +/- 1.9 mmHg PDCT respectively). After bariatric surgery, IOP was significantly lower (15.2 +/- 2.7 mmHg GAT and 16.5 +/- 2.0 mmHg PDCT, p < 0.05) and no significant difference was detected between the operated and control groups. In the whole data at baseline, IOP correlated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference, body fat per cent and systolic blood pressure values. CONCLUSION: Intraocular pressure (IOP) is significantly higher in obese women than in non-obese age-matched controls. Obese subjects had a decrease in IOP after bariatric surgery with no change in IOP in the control group. This change in obese group may be related to weight loss.

Epub 2017 Nov 28.","INTRODUCTION: Due to the high candidate exclusion rate during a drug development process, an early prediction of the pharmacokinetic behavior would be needed. Accordingly, high performance bioaffinity chromatography (HPBAC) approaches are growing in popularity, however, there is a lack of knowledge and no consensus about the relation between HPBAC measurements, in vivo distribution and blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration behavior. With respect to radiotracers, there is almost no reference data available for plasma protein binding (PPB), permeability (Pm) and the membrane coefficient (KIAM). Thus, this study was aimed at exploring the relevance of measuring PPB, Pm and KIAM for the prediction of BBB penetration. METHODS: Measurements of %PPB, Pm and KIAM were performed using HPBAC. In total, 113 compounds were tested, 43 with brain uptake, 30 not showing brain uptake and 40 with known interactions with efflux transporters. Additionally, ClogP and HPLC logPow(pH7.4) data were collected. RESULTS: %PPB, KIAM, Pm and ClogP values were in the same range for each of the three groups. A significant difference was observed for the HPLC logPow(pH7.4) between CNS penetrating drug group (CNSpos) and the non-penetrating drug group (CNSneg), as well as for the CNSneg towards the drug group interacting with efflux transporters (DRUGefflux). However, as the other experimental data, also the HPLC logPow(pH7.4) showed a broad overlapping of the single values between the groupings. CONCLUSION: Experimental reference values (logP, Pm, KIAM & PPB) of commonly used PET tracers and drugs showing different BBB penetration behavior are provided. The influence of the logP on brain uptake depends strongly on the selected method. However, using a single parameter (experimental or calculated) to predict BBB penetration or for the classification of drug groups is inexpedient.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309919,N,no phys of interest,,,
Yoga Practitioners Uniquely Activate the Superior Parietal Lobule and Supramarginal Gyrus During Emotion Regulation,Front Integr Neurosci,"Wadden, Katie P,Snow, Nicholas J,Sande, Peder,Slawson, Sian,Waller, Tom,Boyd, Lara A,eng,Switzerland,Front Integr Neurosci. 2018 Dec 4;12:60. doi: 10.3389/fnint.2018.00060. eCollection 2018.","Chronic stress contributes to both mental and physical illness. A high prevalence and cost of stress-related illnesses North America warrants investigation into alternative or complementary therapies which may help reduce adverse reactions to stressful stimuli. Emotion regulation is the process of monitoring and adjusting emotional responses to environmental stimuli and stressors. Individuals who participate in physical activity are less likely to have adverse responses to potentially stressful situations, potentially due to adaptions in emotion regulation. Yoga is a form of physical activity involving stretching exercises and meditation, that may lessen individuals' levels of stress and anxiety and improve emotion regulation. High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) is considered a measure of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity during the emotion regulation. Measuring HRV and brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a useful, noninvasive approach to evaluating ""neurovisceral"" components of emotion regulation. We aimed to determine whether yoga practitioners (YP) exhibit different patterns of brain activation compared to recreational athletes (RA) without current yoga experience, while viewing emotionally arousing visual stimuli. Our secondary aim was to examine potential differences across groups in HRV throughout the presentation of these stimuli. Analysis of fMRI data during exposure to emotion-evoking (EE) stimuli revealed that the YP group activated two unique brain areas, namely the superior parietal lobule and the supramarginal gyrus. These areas have been associated with attentional awareness and reduced egocentric bias, processes that have been implicated in emotion regulation by others. The RA group activated the inferior middle frontal cortex, an area associated with cognitive reappraisal during emotion regulation. The YP group also demonstrated a trend towards a higher ratio of low- to high-frequency HRV compared to the RA group. The present findings support the presence of experience-dependent neurovisceral mechanisms associated with emotion regulation. Individuals who practice yoga regulate their neurovisceral responses to potentially stressful external stimuli in a different manner than recreational athletes who do not engage in yoga practice. The present study had a small sample size (RA: n = 12; YP: n = 19), which should be taken into account when interpreting the results.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564105,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2018 Feb 3.","Impulsive behavior, difficulties in controlling anger and suicidal behavior are typical patterns of affective/behavioral dysregulation in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Previous functional MRI studies in the resting state condition demonstrated altered functional connectivity (FC) between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the frontoparietal executive control network (ECN), which was significantly associated with impulsivity in BPD. Impulsivity is often defined as a function of inhibitory control, strongly relying on the proper functioning of the fronto-cingulo-striatal network. Noradrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems are assumed to be involved in different forms of impulsive behavior and inhibitory control. In our previous study, we investigated the FC of the main monoamine-producing nuclei within the midbrain and brainstem, which were functionally integrated in specific resting-state networks. In the present study we investigated the resting-state FC of midbrain/brainstem nuclei in 33 unmedicated female patients with BPD and 33 matched healthy controls. We further related altered functional connectivity of these nuclei to the patient's degree of impulsivity. The main finding was that BPD patients showed stronger FC from the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) to the ACC. Functional connectivity between the LC and ACC was positively associated with the degree of motor impulsivity in the total group. Controlling for aggression, a stronger FC was also found between serotonergic nucleus centralis superior (NCS) and the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in patients compared to controls. Furthermore, patients showed a weaker ""anti-correlation"" from the substantia nigra (SNc) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The observed enhanced LC-ACC FC in BPD and its association with the motor impulsivity might be indicative of a noradrenergic dysfunction in the neural inhibitory control network, whereas the significant relationship between NCS-FPC FC and aggression points toward serotonergic contribution to prefrontal control of aggressive reactions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29355588,N,no phys of interest,,,

In the present study, we investigated the correlations between reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in early and higher-tier visual cortical areas and glaucomatous changes in the retinas of patients with mild to moderate POAG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 3-dimensional pseudocontinuous arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T was performed in 20 normal controls and 15 mild to moderate POAG patients. Regions of interest were selected based on the Population-Average, Landmark- and Surface-based (PALS) atlas of the human cerebral cortex. Arterial spin labelling-measured CBF values were extracted in the early and higher-tier visual cortical areas and were compared between patients and controls using a 2-sample t test. Pearson correlation analyses were used to assess the correlations between reduced CBF and cup-to-disc ratio, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and ganglion cell complex thickness. RESULTS: Reduced CBF in early visual cortical areas (V1, V2, and ventral posterior area) and in the higher-tier visual left lateral occipital cortex was presented in mild to moderate POAG patients compared with controls. Furthermore, reduced CBF of the right areas V2 and ventral posterior area was correlated with cup-to-disc ratio, total ganglion cell complex thickness, and average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the complex pathologic progress of POAG includes abnormal cerebral perfusion within the visual cortex since the mild to moderate disease stages. The association of cerebral perfusion changes with alterations of the optic disc and the retina may contribute to the early diagnosis of POAG.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29952821,N,clinical,,,

The lateral occipital complex (LOC), parahippocampal place area (PPA), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) play a crucial role in the cognitive processing of objects and scenes. However, the associated mechanism between objects and scenes remains unclear. In this study, four categories of scene images and four types of significant objects were designed as stimuli. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data showed that correlation coefficients of the activity patterns for objects and scenes were significantly positive in the LOC and PPA. Compared to the out-of-scene objects, the correlation strengths for within-scene objects were significantly greater in the PPA and two subregions of the LOC: the lateral occipital area (LO), and posterior fusiform area (PF). Further correlation analyses showed that the scene-object correlations were different for indoor and outdoor scenes in the LO, pF and PPA. Semantic associations were represented in the LO and pF, while the PPA was involved in semantic correlations and spatial characteristics, which were sensitive to the openness of scenes. However, these trends were not observed in the RSC, suggesting that it is not recruited to process semantic associations between scenes and objects.

The present study examined the relations of ANS activity in the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) with brain activity during emotional face processing in adolescents. 135 adolescents (65 female; M=17.15yr, SD=0.42) completed an emotional faces task during an fMRI scan while electrocardiography and skin conductance were recorded simultaneously. Using linear mixed-effect modelling, we tested the effect of change in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of PNS activity, and number of skin conductance responses (SCRs), a measure of SNS activity, on neural activity while adolescents viewed emotional faces. Greater RSA withdrawal, indicating decreased PNS activity, was associated with increased activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). More SCRs, indicating greater SNS activity, were associated with decreased activation in several regions including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and increased activation in the left hippocampus. Left hippocampus-SCR coupling and vmPFC-RSA coupling predicted baseline SCR and RSA respectively. These findings implicate the hippocampus for potentiating SNS activity, document that regulation of SNS and PNS activity are coordinated with distinct regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, and suggest potential developmental differences in vmPFC regulation of PNS activity between adolescents and adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189339,N,adolescents,,,

We adapted a robust paradigm in which undergraduate students completed fMRI testing after a known ecologically valid stressor (a midterm exam). Negative cognitive style correlated with brain activity in response to both negative and exam-related information in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and/or angular gyrus, both regions involved in abstract, self-referential thought. There were commonalities and differences in patterns of activity, suggesting that these individuals may process domain-general and domain-specific negative information in different ways but drawing upon a common frontoparietal network.

Recording the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform during fMRI is difficult, often causing inaccurate period detection. NEW METHOD: Since the waveform of the BCG extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) is relatively invariable compared to the ECG waveform, we propose a multiple-scale peak-detection algorithm to determine the BCG cycle directly from the EEG data. The algorithm first extracts the high contrast BCG component from the EEG data by ICA. The BCG cycle is then estimated by band-pass filtering the component around the fundamental frequency identified from its energy spectral density, and the peak of BCG artifact occurrence is selected from each of the estimated cycle. RESULTS: The algorithm is shown to achieve a high accuracy on a large EEG-fMRI dataset. It is also adaptive to various heart rates without the needs of adjusting the threshold parameters. The cycle detection remains accurate with the scan duration reduced to half a minute. Additionally, the algorithm gives a figure of merit to evaluate the reliability of the detection accuracy. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: The algorithm is shown to give a higher detection accuracy than the commonly used cycle detection algorithm fmrib_qrsdetect implemented in EEGLAB. CONCLUSIONS: The achieved high cycle detection accuracy of our algorithm without using the ECG waveforms makes possible to create and automate pipelines for processing large EEG-fMRI datasets, and virtually eliminates the need for ECG recordings for BCG artifact removal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614296,N,eeg,,,

The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) enhances the salience of external social cues but its influence on interoception is unknown. The present pharmaco-fMRI study therefore investigated whether OT enhances interoceptive awareness and if it influences the interplay between interoceptive and salience processing. In a randomized, double-blind, between-subject, design study 83 subjects received either intranasal OT or placebo. In Experiment 1, subjects performed a heartbeat detection task alone, while in Experiment 2 they did so while viewing both neutral and emotional face stimuli. Interoceptive accuracy and neural responses in interoceptive and salience networks were measured. In Experiment 1, OT had no significant influence on interoceptive accuracy or associated activity in the right anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. However, in Experiment 2 when face stimuli were also presented, OT decreased interoceptive accuracy and increased right AI activation and its functional connectivity with the left posterior insula (PI), with the latter both being negatively correlated with accuracy scores. The present study provides the first evidence that while OT does not influence processing of interoceptive cues per se it may switch attention away from them towards external salient social cues by enhancing right AI responses and its control over the PI. Thus OT may help regulate the interplay between interoceptive and external salience processing within the insula and could be of potential therapeutic benefit for emotional disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28836577,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, differences between clinical PD subgroups regarding these markers still need to be identified. Objective: To investigate whether clinical phenotypes can be predicted by the assessment of immune marker profiles in the serum of PD patients. Methods: Phenotypes of clinical PD from Tubingen, Germany (n = 145) and Toronto, Canada (n = 90) were defined regarding clinical subtype, disease onset, severity, and progression as well as presence of cognitive and/or autonomic dysfunction. A panel of serum immune markers was assessed using principal component analysis (PCA) and regression models to define the marker(s) that were associated with clinical phenotypes after adjusting for potential confounders. Findings of both centers were compared for validation. Further, a [18F] FEPPA-PET was performed in a group of patients with high and low values of candidate markers for the assessment of in vivo brain microglial activation. Results: Overall, serum immune markers did not cluster to define a pro/anti-inflammatory profile in PCA. Out of 25 markers only IL-12p40 showed a trend to discriminate between PD subgroups in both cohorts which could not be replicated by [18F] FEPPA-PET. Conclusions: Assessment of cytokines in serum does not reliably differentiate clinical PD subtypes. Accompanying subtype-irrelevant inflammation in PD, dual activity, and lack of specificity of the immune markers, the complex function of microglia, probable effects of treatment, disease stage, and progression on inflammation as well as current technical limitations may limit the usefulness of serum immune markers for the differentiation of subtypes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622507,N,no phys of interest,,,

In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI (fMRI) was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45 degrees or 135 degrees ) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS-, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS- stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dACC and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS- in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29497705,N,no phys of interest,,,

Clinical studies into this domain have focused on patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, showing that damage to relevant brain mechanisms can variously alter interoceptive functions. However, the association between peripheral cardiac-system alterations and neurocognitive markers of interoception remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we examined multidimensional neural markers of interoception in patients with early stage of hypertensive disease (HTD) and healthy controls. Strategically, we recruited only HTD patients without cognitive impairment (as shown by neuropsychological tests), brain atrophy (as assessed with voxel-based morphometry), or white matter abnormalities (as evidenced by diffusion tensor imaging analysis). Interoceptive domains were assessed through (a) a behavioral heartbeat detection task; (b) measures of the heart-evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological cortical signature of attention to cardiac signals; and (c) neuroimaging recordings (MRI and fMRI) to evaluate anatomical and functional connectivity properties of key interoceptive regions (namely, the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex). Relative to controls, patients exhibited poorer interoceptive performance and reduced HEP modulations, alongside an abnormal association between interoceptive performance and both the volume and functional connectivity of the above regions. Such results suggest that peripheral cardiac-system impairments can be associated with abnormal behavioral and neurocognitive signatures of interoception. More generally, our findings indicate that interoceptive processes entail bidirectional influences between the cardiovascular and the central nervous systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29271093,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

In recent research, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) is widely used to map the inherent functional networks of the brain. Although previous studies have reported gender differences in rfMRI, the robustness of gender differences is not well characterized. In this study, we use a large data set to test whether rfMRI functional connectivity (FC) can be used to predict gender and identify FC features that are most predictive of gender. We utilized rfMRI data from 820 healthy controls from the Human Connectome Project. By applying a predefined functional template and partial least squares regression modeling, we achieved a gender prediction accuracy of 87% when multi-run rfMRI was used. Permutation tests confirmed that gender prediction was reliable ( p<.001). Effects of motion, age, handedness, blood pressure, weight, and brain volume on gender prediction are discussed. Further, we found that FC features within the default mode (DMN), fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks contributed most to gender prediction. In the DMN, right fusiform gyrus and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex were important contributors. The above regions have been previously implicated in aspects of social functioning and this suggests potential gender differences in social cognition mediated by the DMN. Our findings demonstrate that gender can be reliably predicted using rfMRI data and highlight the importance of controlling for gender in brain imaging studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29322586,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 14.","PURPOSE: Simultaneous multi-slice techniques are reliant on multiband RF pulses, for which conventional design strategies result in long pulse durations, lengthening echo-times so lowering SNR for spin-echo imaging, and lengthening repetition times for gradient echo sequences. Pulse durations can be reduced with advanced RF pulse design methods that use time-variable selection gradients. However, the ability of gradient systems to reproduce fast switching pulses is often limited and can lead to image artifacts when ignored. We propose a time-efficient pulse design method that inherently produces gradient waveforms with lower temporal bandwidth. METHODS: Efficient multiband RF pulses with time-variable gradients were designed using time-optimal VERSE. Using VERSE directly on multiband pulses leads to gradient waveforms with high temporal bandwidth, whereas VERSE applied first to singleband RF pulses and then modulated to make them multiband, significantly reduces this. The relative performance of these approaches was compared using simulation and experimental measurements. RESULTS: Applying VERSE before multiband modulation was successful at removing out-of-band slice distortion. This effectively removes the need for high frequency modulation in the gradient waveform while preserving the benefit of time-efficiency inherited from VERSE. CONCLUSION: We propose a time-efficient RF pulse design that produces gradient pulses with lower temporal bandwidth, reducing image artifacts associated with finite temporal bandwidth of gradient systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277267,N,methods paper,,,

It is currently not known if body composition changes and changes in fat deposition also exist in FTD, the relationship of these changes in eating behavior and appetite, and whether these changes are centrally mediated. METHODS: Body composition was measured in 28 people with behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 16 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 19 healthy controls, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Changes in body composition were correlated to brain grey matter atrophy using voxel-based morphometry on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Behavioral-variant FTD was characterized by changes in body composition, with increased total fat mass, visceral adipose tissue area (VAT area), and android: gynoid ratio compared to control and AD participants (all P values < 0.05). Changes in body composition correlated to abnormal eating behavior and behavioral change (P < 0.01) and functional decline (P < 0.01). Changes in body composition also correlated to grey matter atrophy involving a distributed neural network that included the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, insula, cingulate, and cerebellum - structures known to be central to autonomic control - as well as the thalamus, putamen, accumbens, and caudate, which are involved in reward processing. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in body composition and fat deposition extend the clinical phenomenology in bvFTD beyond cognition and behavior, with changes associated with changes in reward and autonomic processing suggesting that these deficits may be central in FTD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461580,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 2.","Fine-grained activity patterns, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are thought to reflect underlying neural representations. Multivariate analysis techniques, such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), can be used to test models of brain representation by quantifying the representational geometry (the collection of pair-wise dissimilarities between activity patterns). One important caveat, however, is that non-linearities in the coupling between neural activity and the fMRI signal may lead to significant distortions in the representational geometry estimated from fMRI activity patterns. Here we tested the stability of representational dissimilarity measures in primary sensory-motor (S1 and M1) and early visual regions (V1/V2) across a large range of activation levels. Participants were visually cued with different letters to perform single finger presses with one of the 5 fingers at a rate of 0.3-2.6Hz. For each stimulation frequency, we quantified the difference between the 5 activity patterns in M1, S1, and V1/V2. We found that the representational geometry remained relatively stable, even though the average activity increased over a large dynamic range. These results indicate that the representational geometry of fMRI activity patterns can be reliably assessed, largely independent of the average activity in the region. This has important methodological implications for RSA and other multivariate analysis approaches that use the representational geometry to make inferences about brain representations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395930,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2019 May 23.","Cardiac signal contamination has long confounded the analysis of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cardiac pulsation results in significant BOLD signal changes, especially in and around blood vessels. Until the advent of simultaneous multislice echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisition, the time resolution of whole brain EPI was insufficient to avoid cardiac aliasing (and acquisitions with repetition times (TRs) under 400-500ms are still uncommon). As a result, direct detection and removal of the cardiac signal with spectral filters is generally not possible. Modelling methods have been developed to mitigate cardiac contamination, and recently developed techniques permit the visualization of cardiac signal propagation through the brain in undersampled data (e.g., TRs>1s), which is useful in its own right for finding blood vessels. However, both of these techniques require data from which to estimate cardiac phase, which is generally not available for the data in many large databases of existing imaging data, and even now is not routinely recorded in many fMRI experiments. Here we present a method to estimate the cardiac waveform directly from a multislice fMRI dataset, without additional physiological measurements, such as plethysmograms. The pervasive spatial extent and temporal structure of the cardiac contamination signal across the brain offers an opportunity to exploit the nature of multislice imaging to extract this signal from the fMRI data itself. While any particular slice is recorded at the TR of the imaging experiment, slices are recorded much more quickly - typically from 10 to 20Hz - sufficiently fast to fully sample the cardiac signal. Using the fairly permissive assumptions that the cardiac signal is a) pseudoperiodic b) somewhat coherent within any given slice, and c) is similarly shaped throughout the brain, we can extract a good estimate of the cardiac phase as a function of time from fMRI data alone. If we make further assumptions about the shape and consistency of cardiac waveforms, we can develop a deep learning filter to greatly improve our estimate of the cardiac waveform.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129302,N,methods paper,,,

Despite the fact that contingency awareness is necessary for associative learning in some conditioning paradigms, its role in contextual fear conditioning, a variant that uses a context-CS (CTX) instead of a cue, has not been characterized thus far. We investigated if contingency awareness is a prerequisite for contextual fear conditioning and if subjects classified as aware differ from unaware subjects on a hemodynamic, autonomic, and behavioral level. We used a computer-generated picture context as CTX and slightly painful electric stimulation as US while we recorded brain responses by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and obtained skin conductance responses (SCR) and verbal ratings of emotional valence and arousal. SCR analyses revealed that only aware subjects became conditioned to the US-associated CTX (CTX+). Brain activity related to the CTX+ was more strongly pronounced in fear-associated areas like the insula in the aware relative to the unaware group. Finally, the hippocampus was functionally connected to the cingulate cortex and posterior medial frontal gyrus in aware subjects relative to unaware subjects. These task-related differential connectivity patterns suggest that information exchange between the hippocampus and regions involved in the expression of conditioned fear and decision uncertainty is crucial for the acquisition of contingency knowledge. This study demonstrates the importance of contingency awareness for contextual fear conditioning and points to the hippocampus as a potential mediator for contingency learning in contextual learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523574,N,no phys of interest,,,

When HC and ME/CFS were analysed separately, significant correlations were detected for both groups during both rest and task, with stronger correlations during task than rest. In ME/CFS, connections were absent between medulla and midbrain nuclei, although hippocampal connections with these nuclei were enhanced. When corresponding correlations from HC and ME/CFS were compared, ME/CFS connectivity deficits were detected within the brainstem between the medulla and cuneiform nucleus and between the brainstem and hippocampus and intralaminar thalamus, but only during task. In CFS/ME, weaker connectivity between some RAS nuclei was associated with increased symptom severity. RAS neuron oscillatory signals facilitate coherence in thalamo-cortical oscillations.

Response to these cues involves body and brain signals that are linked via dynamic feedback loops, yet no studies have targeted the cardiovascular system as a potential conduit to alter automatic neural processes that maintain cue salience. This proof-of-concept study examined within-person changes in neural response to parallel but unique sets of visual alcohol-related cues at two points in time: prior to versus following a brief behavioral intervention. The active intervention was resonance breathing, a rhythmical breathing task paced at 0.1 Hz (6 breaths per minute) that helps normalize neurocardiac feedback. The control intervention was a low-demand cognitive task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess changes in brain response to the cues presented before (A1) and after (A2) the intervention in 41 emerging adult men and women with varying drinking behaviors. The resonance breathing group exhibited significantly less activation to A2 cues compared with A1 cues in left inferior and superior lateral occipital cortices, right inferior lateral occipital cortex, bilateral occipital pole, and temporal occipital fusiform cortices. This group also showed significantly greater activation to A2 cues compared with A1 cues in medial prefrontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, and precuneus cortices, paracingulate, and lingual gyri. The control group showed no significant changes. Thus, following resonance breathing, activation in brain regions involved in visual processing of cues was reduced, while activation in brain areas implicated in behavioral control, internally directed cognition, and brain-body integration was increased. These findings provide preliminary evidence that manipulation of the cardiovascular system with resonance breathing alters neural activation in a manner theoretically consistent with a dampening of automatic sensory input and strengthening of higher-level cognitive processing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543840,N,no phys of interest,,,

(1987) for the segmentation of system's trajectories into metastable states using recurrence grammars. Here, we apply this recurrence structure analysis (RSA) for the first time to resting-state brain dynamics obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain regions are defined according to the brain hierarchical atlas (BHA) developed by Diez et al. (2015), and as a consequence, regions present high-connectivity in both structure (obtained from diffusion tensor imaging) and function (from the blood-level dependent-oxygenation-BOLD-signal). Remarkably, regions observed by Diez et al. were completely time-invariant. Here, in order to compare this static picture with the metastable systems dynamics obtained from the RSA segmentation, we determine the number of metastable states as a measure of complexity for all subjects and for region numbers varying from 3 to 100. We find RSA convergence toward an optimal segmentation of 40 metastable states for normalized BOLD signals, averaged over BHA modules. Next, we build a bistable dynamics at population level by pooling 30 subjects after Hausdorff clustering. In link with this finding, we reflect on the different modeling frameworks that can allow for such scenarios: heteroclinic dynamics, dynamics with riddled basins of attraction, multiple-timescale dynamics. Finally, we characterize the metastable states both functionally and structurally, using templates for resting state networks (RSNs) and the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas, respectively.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551744,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2019 Jul 11.","As a sequence of movements is learned, serially ordered actions get bound together into sets to reduce computational complexity during planning and execution. Here, we investigated how actions become naturally bound over the course of learning and how this learning affects cortical representations of individual actions. Across 5 weeks of practice, neurologically healthy human subjects learned either a complex 32-item sequence of finger movements (trained group, n = 9; 3 female) or randomly ordered actions (control group, n = 9; 3 female). Over the course of practice, responses during sequence production in the trained group became temporally correlated, consistent with responses being bound together under a common command. These behavioral changes, however, did not coincide with plasticity in the multivariate representations of individual finger movements, assessed using fMRI, at any level of the cortical motor hierarchy. This suggests that the representations of individual actions remain stable, even as the execution of those same actions become bound together in the context of producing a well learned sequence.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Extended practice on motor sequences results in highly stereotyped movement patterns that bind successive movements together. This binding is critical for skilled motor performance, yet it is not currently understood how it is achieved in the brain. We examined how binding altered the patterns of activity associated with individual movements that make up the sequence. We found that fine finger control during sequence production involved correlated activity throughout multiple motor regions; however, we found no evidence for plasticity of the representations of elementary movements. This suggests that binding is associated with plasticity at a more abstract level of the motor hierarchy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296537,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 30.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Individuals of South Asian origin are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities compared with Europids. Disturbances in energy metabolism may contribute to this increased risk. Skeletal muscle and possibly also brown adipose tissue (BAT) are involved in human energy metabolism and nitric oxide (NO) is suggested to play a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in both tissues. We aimed to investigate the effects of 6 weeks of supplementation with L-arginine, a precursor of NO, on energy metabolism by BAT and skeletal muscle, as well as glucose metabolism in South Asian men compared with men of European descent. METHODS: We included ten Dutch South Asian men (age 46.5 +/- 2.8 years, BMI 30.1 +/- 1.1 kg/m(2)) and ten Dutch men of European descent, that were similar with respect to age and BMI, with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level 5.6-6.9 mmol/l or plasma glucose levels 2 h after an OGTT 7.8-11.1 mmol/l). Participants took either L-arginine (9 g/day) or placebo orally for 6 weeks in a randomised double-blind crossover study. Participants were eligible to participate in the study when they were aged between 40 and 55 years, had a BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m(2) and did not have type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, ethnicity was defined as having four grandparents of South Asian or white European origin, respectively. Blinding of treatment was done by the pharmacy (Hankintatukku) and an independent researcher from Leiden University Medical Center randomly assigned treatments by providing a coded list. All people involved in the study as well as participants were blinded to group assignment. After each intervention, glucose tolerance was determined by OGTT and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was determined by indirect calorimetry; BAT activity was assessed by cold-induced [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanning. In addition, a fasting skeletal muscle biopsy was taken and analysed ex vivo for respiratory capacity using a multisubstrate protocol. The primary study endpoint was the effect of L-arginine on BAT volume and activity. RESULTS: L-Arginine did not affect BMR, [(18)F]FDG uptake by BAT or skeletal muscle respiration in either ethnicity. During OGTT, L-arginine lowered plasma glucose concentrations (AUC0-2 h - 9%, p < 0.01), insulin excursion (AUC0-2 h - 26%, p < 0.05) and peak insulin concentrations (-26%, p < 0.05) in Europid but not South Asian men. This coincided with enhanced cold-induced glucose oxidation (+44%, p < 0.05) in Europids only. Of note, in skeletal muscle biopsies several respiration states were consistently lower in South Asian men compared with Europid men. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: L-Arginine supplementation does not affect BMR, [(18)F]FDG uptake by BAT, or skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in Europid and South Asian overweight and prediabetic men. However, L-arginine improves glucose tolerance in Europids but not in South Asians. Furthermore, South Asian men have lower skeletal muscle oxidative capacity than men of European descent.

Therefore, we hypothesized that vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) influenced arterial wall inflammation as measured by (18)F-FDG uptake. RESULTS: Ten patients with left-sided VNS for refractory epilepsy were studied during stimulation (VNS-on) and in the hours after stimulation was switched off (VNS-off). In nine patients, (18)F-FDG uptake was measured in the right carotid artery, aorta, bone marrow, spleen, and adipose tissue. Target-to-background ratios (TBRs) were calculated to normalize the respective standardized uptake values (SUVs) for venous blood pool activity. Median values are shown with interquartile range and compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Arterial SUVs tended to be higher during VNS-off than VNS-on [SUVmax all vessels 1.8 (1.5-2.2) vs. 1.7 (1.2-2.0), p = 0.051]. However, a larger difference was found for the venous blood pool at this time point, reaching statistical significance in the vena cava superior [meanSUVmean 1.3 (1.1-1.4) vs. 1.0 (0.8-1.1); p = 0.011], resulting in non-significant lower arterial TBRs during VNS-off than VNS-on. Differences in the remaining tissues were not significant. Insulin levels increased after VNS was switched off [55.0 pmol/L (45.9-96.8) vs. 48.1 pmol/L (36.9-61.8); p = 0.047]. The concurrent increase in glucose levels was not statistically significant [4.8 mmol/L (4.7-5.3) vs. 4.6 mmol/L (4.5-5.2); p = 0.075].

Description Our program goals were (1) early postpartum hypertension medical management, (2) patient and provider education around CVD risk, (3) transition to primary care provider (PCP) and (4) a sustainable clinical model reimbursed by private and public insurances. We focused on women immediately postpartum in this analysis. Assessment Over the course of 5 years, a racially and socioeconomically diverse population of 412 immediately postpartum women received care for one, two or more appointments. Referral diagnoses included antepartum preeclampsia (PET) 51% (210/412), postpartum preeclampsia/hypertension (PP-PET) 22.3% (92/412), preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (siPET) 10.2% (42/412), chronic hypertension (cHTN) 8.8% (37/412), and gestational hypertension (gHTN) 7.8% (31/412). Almost half of women had 2-3 visits 47.3% (195/412) with no difference by diagnosis (p = 0.18). No show rates were consistently around 25%. Acquisition of home blood pressure monitors increased from 56.8% (44/94) to 93.8% (61/65) over the 5 years (p < 0.0001). Nearly half of patients seen had antihypertensive medication adjustments 48.3% (199/412). Of those patients scheduled, 86.8% (79/91) attended a nutrition consultation. For patients with PCPs within our system, 79.5% (105/132) kept their scheduled follow up PCP appointments. Conclusion We report a postpartum transition clinic after hypertensive pregnancy. In this diverse population, patients attended 2-3 visits, incorporated home blood pressure monitoring, adjusted antihypertensive medications and initiated prevention measures such as nutrition referrals and PCP follow-up.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a population-based sample of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents who underwent longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Using a text search of radiologists' notes for 2402 individuals (median age, 75.0 years) who underwent imaging between August 10, 2005, and July 31, 2014, we identified 52 patients (2.2%) who had at least one meningioma. We estimated the association of selected risk factors with the presence of meningioma using odds ratios and 95% CIs from logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex. Based on these results, we moved the most significant variables forward to a multivariable model. RESULTS: Controlling for age and sex, significant associations with the presence of meningioma included higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P=.03), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.13-3.95; P=.02), aspirin (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.05-3.46; P=.04), and blood pressure-lowering medication (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.06-3.99; P=.03). Lower risk was associated with male sex (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; P=.02), coronary artery disease (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.97; P=.04), and higher self-reported anxiety (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98; P=.02). Simultaneous adjustment for all of these factors except aspirin in a multivariable model did not attenuate these associations (concordance, 0.71). CONCLUSION: In a population-based sample of 2402 participants, 52 (2.2%) had an incidental meningioma. They were more likely to be female and have higher body mass index. Meningioma was also associated with certain medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and blood pressure-lowering medications) and inversely with anxiety and coronary artery disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30711123,N,no brain data,,,

METHODS: This study included 202 CN old adults who participated in the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (KBASE) study. All participants underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment, [(11)C] Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET), [(18)F] Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging.

All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, education, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status, vascular risk score, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, and use of sleep medication. RESULTS: Bad sleep quality and short sleep duration during midlife were significantly associated with increased Abeta deposition and AD signature regional hypometabolism, respectively. Although current bad sleep quality appeared to be associated with increased Abeta accumulation, this association disappeared after controlling for the effects of midlife sleep quality. Neither the quality nor duration of sleep during young adulthood was related to Abeta burden or neurodegeneration.

The PD-AUT+ group showed poorer cognitive performance on frontal/executive function than the PD-AUT- group. The PD-AUT+ group exhibited severely disrupted white matter connectivity in both fronto-subcortical and posterior cortical regions, which was well correlated with the severity of autonomic dysfunction assessed by the CASS.

One third of the 27 GWI participants had brain stem atrophy and developed postural tachycardia after exercise (START: Stress Test Activated Reversible Tachycardia). The remainder activated basal ganglia and anterior insulae during a cognitive task (STOPP: Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception). Here, the role of attention in cognitive dysfunction was assessed by seed region correlations during a simple 0-back stimulus matching task (""see a letter, push a button"") performed before exercise. Analysis was analogous to resting state, but different from psychophysiological interactions (PPI). The patterns of correlations between nodes in task and default networks were significantly different for START (n = 9), STOPP (n = 18) and control (n = 8) subjects.

START had a large task module centered on the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex with direct links to basal ganglia, anterior insulae, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex nodes, and through dorsal attention network (intraparietal sulci and frontal eye fields) nodes to a default module. STOPP had 2 task submodules of basal ganglia-anterior insulae, and dorsolateral prefrontal executive control regions.

A large volume of research has identified a network of sub-cortical brain regions underlying music-induced emotions. Additionally, separate evidence from electroencephalography (EEG) studies suggests that prefrontal asymmetry in the EEG reflects the approach-withdrawal response to music-induced emotion. However, fMRI and EEG measure quite different brain processes and we do not have a detailed understanding of the functional relationships between them in relation to music-induced emotion. We employ a joint EEG - fMRI paradigm to explore how EEG-based neural correlates of the approach-withdrawal response to music reflect activity changes in the sub-cortical emotional response network. The neural correlates examined are asymmetry in the prefrontal EEG, and the degree of disorder in that asymmetry over time, as measured by entropy. Participants' EEG and fMRI were recorded simultaneously while the participants listened to music that had been specifically generated to target the elicitation of a wide range of affective states. While listening to this music, participants also continuously reported their felt affective states. Here we report on co-variations in the dynamics of these self-reports, the EEG, and the sub-cortical brain activity. We find that a set of sub-cortical brain regions in the emotional response network exhibits activity that significantly relates to prefrontal EEG asymmetry. Specifically, EEG in the pre-frontal cortex reflects not only cortical activity, but also changes in activity in the amygdala, posterior temporal cortex, and cerebellum. We also find that, while the magnitude of the asymmetry reflects activity in parts of the limbic and paralimbic systems, the entropy of that asymmetry reflects activity in parts of the autonomic response network such as the auditory cortex. This suggests that asymmetry magnitude reflects affective responses to music, while asymmetry entropy reflects autonomic responses to music. Thus, we demonstrate that it is possible to infer activity in the limbic and paralimbic systems from pre-frontal EEG asymmetry. These results show how EEG can be used to measure and monitor changes in the limbic and paralimbic systems. Specifically, they suggest that EEG asymmetry acts as an indicator of sub-cortical changes in activity induced by music. This shows that EEG may be used as a measure of the effectiveness of music therapy to evoke changes in activity in the sub-cortical emotion response network. This is also the first time that the activity of sub-cortical regions, normally considered ""invisible"" to EEG, has been shown to be characterisable directly from EEG dynamics measured during music listening.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263113,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, most previous evidence is inconsistent, behaviorally unspecific, and virtually null in terms of direct electrophysiological and multimodal markers. To circumvent these limitations, we conducted the first assessment of the relation between cardiac interoception and smoked cocaine dependence (SCD) in a sample of (a) 25 participants who fulfilled criteria for dependence on such a drug, (b) 22 participants addicted to insufflated clorhidrate cocaine (only for behavioral assessment), and (c) 25 healthy controls matched by age, gender, education, and socioeconomic status.

We complemented this behavioral and electrophysiological data with offline structural (MRI) and functional connectivity (fMRI) analysis of the main interoceptive hubs. HBD and HEP results convergently showed that SCD subjects presented ongoing psychophysiological measures of enhanced interoceptive accuracy. This pattern was associated with a structural and functional tuning of interoceptive networks (reduced volume and specialized network segregation). Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of an association between cardiac interoception and smoked cocaine, partially supporting models that propose hyper-interoception as a key aspect of addiction. More generally, our study shows that multimodal assessments of interoception could substantially inform the clinical and neurocognitive characterization of psychophysiological and neurocognitive adaptations triggered by addiction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867552,N,clinical,,,

Although pupil diameter is known to be associated with noradrenergic firing in the pontine Locus Coeruleus (LC), thus far the causal chain coupling spontaneous pupil dynamics to specific cortical brain networks remains unknown. In the present study, we acquired steady-state blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data combined with eye-tracking pupillometry from fifteen healthy subjects that were trained to maintain a constant attentional load. Regression analysis revealed widespread visual and sensorimotor BOLD-fMRI deactivations correlated with pupil diameter. Furthermore, we found BOLD-fMRI activations correlated with pupil diameter change rate within a set of brain regions known to be implicated in selective attention, salience, error-detection and decision-making. These regions included LC, thalamus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), dorsal anterior cingulate and paracingulate cortex (dACC/PaCC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and right anterior insular cortex (rAIC). Granger-causality analysis performed on these regions yielded a complex pattern of interdependence, wherein LC and pupil dynamics were far apart in the network and separated by several cortical stages. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis revealed the ubiquitous presence of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in the networks identified by the brain regions correlated to the pupil diameter change rate. No significant correlations were observed between pupil dynamics, regional activation and behavioral performance. Based on the involved brain regions, we speculate that pupil dynamics reflects brain processing implicated in changes between self- and environment-directed awareness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619948,N,no corr,,,
Reappraisal of incentives ameliorates choking under pressure and is correlated with changes in the neural representations of incentives,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,"Dunne, Simon,Chib, Vikram S,Berleant, Joseph,O'Doherty, John P,eng,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,England,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci. 2019 Jan 4;14(1):13-22. doi: 10.1093/scan/nsy108.","It has been observed that the performing for high stakes can, paradoxically, lead to uncharacteristically poor performance. Here we investigate a novel approach to attenuating such 'choking under pressure' by instructing participants performing a demanding motor task that rewards successful performance with a monetary gain, to reappraise this incentive as a monetary loss for unsuccessful performance. We show that when participants applied this simple strategy, choking was significantly reduced. This strategy also influenced participants' neural and physiological activity. When participants reappraised the incentive as a potential monetary loss, the representation of the magnitude of the incentive in the ventral striatum Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal was attenuated. In addition, individual differences in the degree of attenuation of the neural response to incentive predicted the effectiveness of the reappraisal strategy in reducing choking. Furthermore, participants' skin conductance changed in proportion to the magnitude of the incentive being played for, and was exaggerated on high incentive trials on which participants failed. Reappraisal of the incentive abolished this exaggerated skin conductance response. This represents the first experimental association of sympathetic arousal with choking. Taken together, these results suggest that reappraisal of the incentive is indeed a promising intervention for attenuating choking under pressure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481355,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2019 Feb 19.","Standard fear extinction relies on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to form a new memory given the omission of threat. Using fMRI in humans, we investigated whether replacing threat with novel neutral outcomes (instead of just omitting threat) facilitates extinction by engaging the vmPFC more effectively than standard extinction. Computational modeling of associability (indexing surprise strength and dynamically modulating learning rates) characterized skin conductance responses and vmPFC activity during novelty-facilitated but not standard extinction. Subjects who showed faster within-session updating of associability during novelty-facilitated extinction also expressed better extinction retention the next day, as expressed through skin conductance responses. Finally, separable patterns of connectivity between the amygdala and ventral versus dorsal mPFC characterized retrieval of novelty-facilitated versus standard extinction memories, respectively. These results indicate that replacing threat with novel outcomes stimulates vmPFC involvement on extinction trials, leading to a more durable long-term extinction memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Psychiatric disorders characterized be excessive fear are a major public health concern. Popular clinical treatments, such as exposure therapy, are informed by principles of Pavlovian extinction. Thus, there is motivation to optimize extinction strategies in the laboratory so as to ultimately develop more effective clinical treatments. Here, we used functional neuroimaging in humans and found that replacing (rather than just omitting) expected aversive events with novel and neutral outcomes engages the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during extinction learning. Enhanced extinction also diminished activity in threat-related networks (e.g., the insula, thalamus) during immediate extinction and a 24 h extinction retention test. This is new evidence for how behavioral protocols designed to enhance extinction affects neurocircuitry underlying the learning and retention of extinction memories.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782974,N,no phys of interest,,,

While extinction can reduce conditioned responding, Pavlovian relapse phenomena-the return of conditioned responding following successful extinction-challenge the long-term success of extinction-based treatments. Translational laboratory models of Pavlovian relapse could therefore represent a valuable tool to investigate the mechanisms mediating relapse, although so far human research has mostly focused on return of fear phenomena. To this end we developed an appetitive conditioning paradigm with liquid food rewards in combination with a 3-day design to investigate the return of appetitive Pavlovian responses and the involved neural structures in healthy subjects. Pavlovian conditioning (day 1) was assessed in 62 participants, and a subsample (n = 33) further completed extinction (day 2) and a reinstatement test (day 3). Conditioned responding was assessed on explicit (pleasantness ratings) and implicit measures (reaction time, skin conductance, heart rate, startle response) and reinstatement effects were further evaluated using fMRI. We observed a return of conditioned responding during the reinstatement test, evident by enhanced skin conductance responses, accompanied by enhanced BOLD responses in the amygdala. On an individual level, psychophysiological reinstatement intensity was significantly anticorrelated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation, and marginally anticorrelated with enhanced amygdala-vmPFC connectivity during late reinstatement. Our results extend evidence from return of fear phenomena to the appetitive domain, and highlight the role of the vmPFC and its functional connection with the amygdala in regulating appetitive Pavlovian relapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113931,Y,corr,uns,,

It considers RSA and PCM as Bayesian model comparison procedures that assess the evidence for stimulus or condition-specific patterns of responses distributed over voxels or channels. On this view, one can use standard variational inference procedures to quantify the contributions of particular patterns to the data, by evaluating second-order parameters or hyperparameters. Crucially, this allows one to use parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) to infer which patterns are consistent among subjects. At the between-subject level, one can then assess the evidence for different (combinations of) hypotheses about condition-specific effects using Bayesian model comparison. Alternatively, one can select a single hypothesis that best explains the pattern of responses using Bayesian model selection. This note rehearses the technical aspects of within and between-subject RSA using a worked example, as implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software.

We investigated the effect of 26 weeks of supervised aerobic treadmill exercise training on brain glucose metabolism and cognition among 23 late-middle-aged adults from a cohort enriched with familial and genetic risk of AD. They were randomized to Usual Physical Activity (PA) or Enhanced PA conditions. Usual PA received instruction about maintaining an active lifestyle. Enhanced PA completed a progressive exercise training program consisting of 3 sessions of treadmill walking per week for 26 weeks. By week seven, participants exercised at 70- 80% heart rate reserve for 50 minutes per session to achieve 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week in accordance with public health guidelines. Before and after the intervention, participants completed a graded treadmill test to assess VO2peak as a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), wore an accelerometer to measure free-living PA, underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging to assess brain glucose metabolism, and a neuropsychological battery to assess episodic memory and executive function. VO2peak increased, sedentary behavior decreased, and moderate-to-vigorous PA increased significantly in the Enhanced PA group as compared to Usual PA. Glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) did not change significantly in Enhanced PA relative to Usual PA. However, change in PCC glucose metabolism correlated positively with change in VO2peak. Executive function, but not episodic memory, was significantly improved after Enhanced PA relative to Usual PA. Improvement in executive function correlated with increased VO2peak.

Yet, brainstem function is difficult to explore in living humans and is therefore mostly studied using animal models or postmortem human anatomy studies. We developed a methodology to identify brainstem nuclei involved in baroreflex cardiovascular control in humans by combining pharmacological baroreflex testing with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Materials and Methods: In 11 healthy men, we applied eight repeated intravenous phenylephrine bolus doses of 25 and 75 mug followed by a saline flush using a remote-controlled injector during multiband functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition of the whole brain including the brainstem. Continuous finger arterial blood pressure, respiration, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored. fMRI data were preprocessed with a brainstem-specific pipeline and analyzed with a general linear model (GLM) to identify brainstem nuclei involved in central integration of the baroreceptor input. Results: Phenylephrine elicited a pressor response followed by a baroreflex-mediated lengthening of the RR interval (25 mug: 197 +/- 15 ms; 75 mug: 221 +/- 33 ms). By combining fMRI responses during both phenylephrine doses, we identified significant signal changes in the nucleus tractus solitarii (t = 5.97), caudal ventrolateral medulla (t = 4.59), rostral ventrolateral medulla (t = 7.11), nucleus ambiguus (t = 5.6), nucleus raphe obscurus (t = 6.45), and several other brainstem nuclei [p < 0.0005 family-wise error (few)-corr.]. Conclusion: Pharmacological baroreflex testing during fMRI allows characterizing central baroreflex regulation at the level of the brainstem in humans. Baroreflex-mediated activation and deactivation patterns are consistent with previous investigations in animal models. The methodology has the potential to elucidate human physiology and mechanisms of autonomic cardiovascular disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890917,Y,corr,uns,,

Results showed that psychological stress increased vmPFC functional connectivity with individual brain areas implicated in stressor processing (e.g., insula, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and decreased connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex and thalamus. There were no statistical differences in vmPFC connectivity to individual brain areas during recovery, as compared with baseline. Spatial similarity analyses revealed stressor-evoked increased connectivity of the vmPFC with the so-called dorsal attention, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks, as well as decreased connectivity with the default mode network. During recovery, vmPFC connectivity increased with the frontoparietal network. Finally, individual differences in heart rate and perceived stress were associated with vmPFC connectivity to the ventral attention, frontoparietal, and default mode networks.

Thirty-five right-handed, healthy adults were presented idiographic negative self-beliefs embedded in autobiographical scripts. We measured negative emotion ratings, autonomic psychophysiology, and functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen-level dependent responses while participants read neutral statements, reacted to their own negative self-beliefs, and implemented reappraisal and acceptance strategies.

The current study assessed the relationship between perceived stress and the neurobehavioral response to stress in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) and healthy controls (HCs) using heart rate, salivary cortisol level, and functional magnetic resonance imaging and compared these effects between HCs and LTLE. Matched on perceived stress levels, groups of 36 patients with LTLE and 36 HCs completed the Montreal Imaging Stress Task, with control and stress math task conditions. Among LTLEs, 27 reported that prior (acute) stress affected their seizures (LTLES+), while nine did not (LTLES-). The results revealed that increased perceived stress was associated with seizure frequency in LTLE. Further, cortisol secretion was greater in LTLE, but did not vary with perceived stress as observed in HCs. A linear mixed-effects analysis revealed that as perceived stress increased, activation in the hippocampal complex (parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus) decreased during stressful math in the LTLES+, increased in HCs, but did not vary in the LTLES-. Task-based functional connectivity analyses revealed LTLE differences in hippocampal functional connectivity with sensory cortex specific to stressor modalities.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate high-resolution DT-CMR using a segmented variable density spiral sequence with correction for motion, off-resonance, and T2*-related blurring. METHODS: A single-shot stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) echo-planar-imaging (EPI) DT-CMR sequence at 2.8 x 2.8 x 8 mm(3) and 1.8 x 1.8 x 8 mm(3) was compared to a single-shot spiral at 2.8 x 2.8 x 8 mm(3) and an interleaved spiral sequence at 1.8 x 1.8 x 8 mm(3) resolution in 10 healthy volunteers at peak systole and diastasis. Motion-induced phase was corrected using the densely sampled central k-space data of the spirals. STEAM field maps and T2* measures were obtained using a pair of stimulated echoes each with a double spiral readout, the first used to correct the motion-induced phase of the second. RESULTS: The high-resolution spiral sequence produced similar DT-CMR results and quality measures to the standard-resolution sequence in both cardiac phases. Residual differences in fractional anisotropy and helix angle gradient between the resolutions could be attributed to spatial resolution and/or signal-to-noise ratio. Data quality increased after both motion-induced phase correction and off-resonance correction, and sharpness increased after T2* correction. The high-resolution EPI sequence failed to provide sufficient data quality for DT-CMR reconstruction. CONCLUSION: In this study, an in vivo DT-CMR acquisition at 1.8 x 1.8 mm(2) in-plane resolution was demonstrated using a segmented spiral STEAM sequence. Motion-induced phase and off-resonance corrections are essential for high-resolution spiral DT-CMR.

Here, a multilevel approach was applied to test the non-synonymous HCRTR1 C/T Ile408Val gene variant (rs2271933) for association with PD/AG in two independent case-control samples (total n = 613 cases, 1839 healthy subjects), as an outcome predictor of a six-weeks exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG patients (n = 189), as well as with respect to agoraphobic cognitions (ACQ) (n = 483 patients, n = 2382 healthy subjects), fMRI alerting network activation in healthy subjects (n = 94), and a behavioral avoidance task in PD/AG pre- and post-CBT (n = 271). The HCRTR1 rs2271933 T allele was associated with PD/AG in both samples independently, and in their meta-analysis (p = 4.2 x 10(-7)), particularly in the female subsample (p = 9.8 x 10(-9)). T allele carriers displayed a significantly poorer CBT outcome (e.g., Hamilton anxiety rating scale: p = 7.5 x 10(-4)). The T allele count was linked to higher ACQ sores in PD/AG and healthy subjects, decreased inferior frontal gyrus and increased locus coeruleus activation in the alerting network.

This may reflect an overestimation of the dose-response relation between sodium reduction (SR) and blood pressure (BP) used in mortality modeling studies. OBJECTIVES: The present meta-regression analysis sought to estimate the dose-response relations between SR and BP in study groups with mean BP above or below the 75th percentile of the general population. METHODS: Based on a literature search from 1 January 1946 to 11 April 2018, we identified 133 randomized controlled trials allocating healthy or hypertensive individuals to SR or usual sodium intake. Multivariable regression analyses of the mean SR versus the mean blood pressure effect adjusted for effect modifiers were performed. RESULTS: In study groups with mean BP above the 75th percentile [131/78 mm Hg systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP)], there was strong evidence of a linear dose-response relation between SR and BP. For SBP, the dose-response relation was -7.7 mm Hg/100 mmol SR (95% CI: -10.4, -5.0), and for DBP it was -3.0 mm Hg/100 mmol SR (95% CI: -4.6, -1.4). In study groups with mean BP </= 131/78 mm Hg, the relation between SR and BP was weak. For SBP it was -1.46 mm Hg/100 mmol SR (95% CI: -2.7, -0.20) and for DBP it was: -0.07 mm Hg/100 mmol SR (95% CI: -1.5, 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: Only study groups with a BP in the highest 25th percentile of the population showed a clinically significant drop in BP with SR.

Resting-state BOLD fMRI data were obtained from the entire BS and cervical SC in 16 healthy participants, at 3T, with T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo imaging. Data were spatially normalized and processed to remove physiological noise. Cluster-cluster functional connectivity was investigated across the entire 3D region by means of temporal correlations, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate RSNs. Extensive connectivity was observed within and across BS and SC regions, with connections spanning up to 120mm, although shorter connections were more prevalent. SEM results revealed extensive brainstem-cord connectivity that included specific anatomical regions within the brainstem. The results indicate the presence of a complex resting-state network which is highly interconnected in the spinal cord. Known anatomical connections between cortical and BS regions support the conclusion that the observed resting-state BOLD fluctuations in the BS/SC may be related to autonomic regulation. Future studies are required to further investigate these resting-state BOLD networks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776404,N,no phys of interest,,,

The function of this neural circuit is altered by negative life experiences, which can potentially affect threat-related emotional processes. Notably, Black-American individuals disproportionately endure negative life experiences compared to White-American individuals. However, the relationships among negative life experiences, race, and the neural substrates that support threat-related emotional function remains unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated whether the brain function that supports threat-related emotional processes varies with racial differences in negative life experiences. In the present study, adolescent violence exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage were measured prospectively (i.e., at 11-19 years of age) for Black-American and White-American volunteers. Participants then, as young adults (i.e., 18-23 years of age), completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cued and non-cued threats were presented during the conditioning task and behavioral (threat expectancy) and psychophysiological responses (skin conductance response; SCR) were recorded simultaneously with fMRI. Racial differences were observed in neural (fMRI activity), behavioral (threat expectancy), and psychophysiological (SCR) responses to threat. These threat-elicited responses also varied with negative life experiences (violence exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage). Notably, racial differences in brain activity to threat were smaller after accounting for negative life experiences. The present findings suggest that racial differences in the neural and behavioral response to threat are due, in part, to exposure to negative life experiences and may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in mental health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401241,N,no corr,,,

Recent studies suggested that freezing facilitates action preparation and decision-making but the neurocognitive mechanisms remain unclear. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging, posturographic and autonomic measurements while participants performed a shooting task under threat of shock. Two independent studies, in unselected civilians (N = 22) and police recruits (N = 54), revealed that preparation for shooting decisions under threat is associated with postural freezing, bradycardia, midbrain activity (including the periaqueductal gray-PAG) and PAG-amygdala connectivity. Crucially, stronger activity in the midbrain/PAG during this preparatory stage of freezing predicted faster subsequent accurate shooting. Finally, the switch from preparation to active shooting was associated with tachycardia, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) activity and pgACC-amygdala connectivity. These findings suggest that threat-anticipatory midbrain activity centred around the PAG supports decision-making by facilitating action preparation and highlight the role of the pgACC when switching from preparation to action. These results translate animal models of the neural switch from freeze-to-action. In addition, they reveal a core neural circuit for shooting performance under threat and provide empirical evidence for the role of defensive reactions such as freezing in subsequent action decision-making.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862811,N,no phys of interest,,,

We applied multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) paired with CBF measurements in 14 healthy subjects exposed to 5-min carbon dioxide-enriched breathing air to induce cerebral vasodilatation by hypercapnia. Stiffness and viscosity as quantified by the magnitude and phase angle of the complex shear modulus, |G*| and varphi, as well as CBF of the whole brain and 25 gray matter sub-regions were analyzed prior to, during, and after hypercapnia. In all subjects, whole-brain stiffness and viscosity increased due to hypercapnia by 3.3 +/- 1.9% and 2.0 +/- 1.1% which was accompanied by a CBF increase of 36 +/- 15%. Post-hypercapnia, |G*| and varphi reduced to normal values while CBF decreased by 13 +/- 15% below baseline. Hypercapnia-induced viscosity changes correlated with CBF changes, whereas stiffness changes did not. The MRE-measured viscosity changes correlated with blood viscosity changes predicted by the Fahraeus-Lindqvist model and microvessel diameter changes from the literature. Our results suggest that brain viscoelastic properties are influenced by microvessel blood flow and blood viscosity: vasodilatation and increased blood viscosity due to hypercapnia result in an increase in MRE values related to viscosity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30182788,N,no phys of interest,,,

Here, we used high-quality data of 391 subjects from the Human Connectome Project to estimate the effective connectivity (EC) between the BNST, the LB, CM, and SF through spectral dynamic causal modeling, the relation of the EC estimates with age and sex as well as their stability over time. Our results reveal a time-stable asymmetric EC structure with positive EC between all amygdala nuclei, which strongly inhibited the BNST while the BNST exerted positive influence onto all amygdala nuclei. Simulation of the impulse response of the estimated system showed that this EC structure shapes partially antagonistic (out of phase) activity flow between the BNST and amygdala nuclei. Moreover, the BNST-LB and BNST-CM EC parameters were less negative in males.

Clinical observations of global motor responses and subsequent motor behavioral changes after stimulation in certain sites suggest modulation of central sensorimotor control, however, the neuroanatomical correlates remain undescribed. We hypothesized that different body sites would specifically influence the sensorimotor system during the stimulation. We tested the hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in thirty healthy volunteers (mean age 24.2) scanned twice during intermittent manual pressure stimulation, once at the right lateral heel according to reflex locomotion therapy, and once at the right lateral ankle (control site). A flexible modeling approach with finite impulse response basis functions was employed since non-canonical hemodynamic response was expected. Subsequently, a clustering algorithm was used to separate areas with differential timecourses. Stimulation at both sites induced responses throughout the sensorimotor system that could be mostly separated into two anti-correlated subsystems with transient positive or negative signal change and rapid adaptation, although in heel stimulation, insulo-opercular cortices and pons showed sustained activation. In direct voxel-wise comparison, heel stimulation was associated with significantly higher activation levels in the contralateral primary motor cortex and decreased activation in the posterior parietal cortex. Thus, we demonstrate that the manual pressure stimulation affects multiple brain structures involved in motor control and the choice of stimulation site impacts the shape and amplitude of the blood oxygenation level-dependent response.

The challenge posed by this question rests largely in the fact that pain per se exhibits highly intense but unspecific characteristics. These therefore should be matched by potential control conditions. Here, we used a unique combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral and autonomic measures to address this longstanding debate in pain research. Subjects rated perceived intensity in a sequence alternating between heat and sound stimuli. Neuronal activity was monitored using fMRI. Either modality was presented in 6 different intensities, 3 of which lay above the pain threshold (for heat) or the unpleasantness threshold (for sound). We performed our analysis on 26 volunteers in which psychophysiological responses (as per skin conductance responses [SCRs]) did not differ between the 2 stimulus modalities. Having thus ascertained a comparable amount of stimulation-related but unspecific activation, we analyzed stimulus-response functions (SRFs) after painful stimulation and contrasted them with those of the matched acoustic control condition. Furthermore, analysis of fMRI data was performed on the brain surface to circumvent blurring issues stemming from the close proximity of several regions of interest located in heavily folded cortical areas. We focused our analyses on insular and peri-insular regions that are strongly involved in processing of painful stimuli. We employed an axiomatic approach to determine areas showing higher activation in painful compared to nonpainful heat and, at the same time, showing a steeper SRF for painful heat compared to unpleasant sound. Intriguingly, an area in the posterior parietal operculum emerged, whose response showed a pain preference after satisfying all axiomatic constraints. This result has important implications for the interpretation of functional imaging findings in pain research, because it clearly demonstrates that there are areas where activity following painful stimulation is not due to general attributes or results of sensory stimulation, such as salience or arousal. Conversely, several areas did not conform to the formulated axioms to rule out general factors as explanations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404058,N,no corr,,,

We established both cohorts from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2011 to observe the incidence of fracture. The occurrence of fracture was followed-up until the end of 2011. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure was incidence of fracture. The relative risk of fracture was estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, sex, index year and comorbidities. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, alcohol-related illness, osteoporosis, end-stage renal disease, obesity and rheumatoid arthritis, using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification. FINDINGS: Patients with OUD were 4.13 times more likely to suffer fractures than patients without OUD [incidence rate (IR) per 1000 person-years = 23.0 versus 5.47, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.27-4.29].

Both correlational analyses and SEM showed extensive connectivity within and across BS and SC regions, and 37% to 40% of significant connections were consistent across study conditions. However, significant differences in connectivity between specific regions of the BS and SC were also identified which depended on the study conditions. The results indicate that connectivity across the RS SC/BS is influenced by a person's cognitive/emotional state.

However, the burden of such regional hypoperfusion has not been evaluated by gold-standard voxel-by-voxel CBF measurements. Specifically, the authors sought to determine whether the proportion of brain affected by hypoperfusion was greater in patients with DCI than in SAH controls without DCI and whether the symptomatic hemisphere (in those with lateralizing deficits) exhibited a greater cerebral hypoperfusion burden. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with aneurysmal SAH underwent 15O PET to measure regional CBF during the period of risk for DCI (median 8 days after SAH, IQR 7-10 days). Regions of visibly abnormal brain on head CT studies, including areas of hemorrhage and infarction, were excluded. Burden of hypoperfusion was defined as the proportion of PET voxels in normal-appearing brain with CBF < 25 ml/100 g/min. Global CBF and hypoperfusion burden were compared between patients with and those without DCI at the time of PET. For patients with focal impairments from DCI, the authors also compared average CBF and hypoperfusion burden in symptomatic versus asymptomatic hemispheres. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (38%) had clinical DCI at the time of PET. Those with DCI had higher mean arterial pressure (MAP; 126 +/- 14 vs 106 +/- 12 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and 18 (78%) were on vasopressor therapy at the time of PET study. While global CBF was not significantly lower in patients with DCI (mean 39.4 +/- 11.2 vs 43.0 +/- 8.3 ml/100 g/min, p = 0.16), the burden of hypoperfusion was greater (20%, IQR 12%-23%, vs 12%, 9%-16%, p = 0.006). Burden of hypoperfusion performed better than global CBF as a predictor of DCI (area under the curve 0.71 vs 0.65, p = 0.044). Neither global CBF nor hypoperfusion burden differed in patients who responded to therapy compared to those who had not improved by the time of PET. Although hemispheric CBF was not lower in the symptomatic versus contralateral hemisphere in the 13 patients with focal deficits, there was a trend toward greater burden of hypoperfusion in the symptomatic hemisphere (21% vs 18%, p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of hypoperfusion was greater in patients with DCI, despite hemodynamic therapies, higher MAP, and equivalent global CBF. Similarly, hypoperfusion burden was greater in the symptomatic hemisphere of DCI patients with focal deficits even though the average CBF was similar to that in the contralateral hemisphere. Evaluating the proportion of the brain with critical hypoperfusion after SAH may better capture the extent of DCI than averaging CBF across heterogenous brain regions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151110,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, it remains unclear whether vIFC in healthy brains is associated with neuropsychological and neurophysiological measurements. Using the Nathan Kline Institute/Rockland lifespan cross-sectional datasets and openfMRI single participant longitudinal datasets, we found consistent spatial patterns of vIFC across the entire cortical mantle: the inferior parietal and the precuneus exhibited high vIFC. On a time scale of years, we observed that vIFC increased with age in the left ventral posterior cingulate gyrus. On a time scale of days and weeks, vIFC demonstrated the capacity to identify a link between anxiety and pulse. These results showed that vIFC can serve as a useful neuroimaging marker for detecting physiological, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental transitions.

Thirty-seven SAOA patients and 49 healthy controls (HCs) were included at two centers. We investigated the structural and functional characteristics of SAOA brains using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional imaging (rs-fMRI). In order to examine the functional consequence of structural cerebellar alterations, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and degree centrality (DC) were analyzed, and then assessed their relation with disease severity, disease duration, and age of onset within these regions. Group differences were investigated using two-sample t tests, controlling for age, gender, site, and the total intracranial volume. The VBM analysis revealed a significant, mostly bilateral reduction of local gray matter (GM) volume in lobules I-V, V, VI, IX, X, and vermis VIII a/b in SAOA patients, compared with HCs. The GM volume loss in these regions was significantly associated with disease severity, disease duration, and age of onset. The disease-related atrophy regions did not show any functional alternations compared with HCs but were functionally characterized by high ALFF and poor DC compared with intact cerebellar regions. Our data revealed volume reduction in SAOA in cerebellar regions that are known to be involved in motor and somatosensory processing, corresponding with the clinical phenotype of SAOA.

Novel information is viewed as a driving factor to update memory; however, it is unknown whether different forms of novelty play the same role. In addition, although pharmacological intervention studies have confirmed that prediction error (PE) during reactivation is a necessary condition in memory destabilization, the role of PE in retrieval extinction has remained under debate; furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying the process are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated two forms of novelty: PE and stimulus novelty without PE during reactivation to compare their role in memory lability. Skin conductance responses (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to clarify their role at the behavioural and neural mechanism levels. A total of 54 healthy adults were tested in a three-day retrieval extinction protocol. The results showed that PE, the novelty of CS-US combinations, was a critical condition to destabilize memory. The novelty of the stimulus itself with the absence of PE was insufficient for retrieving the memory. The neural mechanisms that distinguished standard extinction from retrieval extinction were that the latter was associated with a diminished recruitment of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and decreased functional connectivity of the dlPFC-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and IT-dlPFC.

Compared to individuals with smaller lesions, individuals with confluent lesions (exceeding 20 mm in diameter) had reductions in cortical and hippocampal perfusion, striatal and hippocampal D2-receptor availability, white-matter microstructure, and reduced performance on tests of episodic memory, sequence learning, and processing speed. Higher cardiovascular risk as assessed by treatment for hypertension, systolic blood pressure, overweight, and smoking was associated with lower frontal cortical perfusion, lower putaminal D2DR availability, smaller grey-matter volumes, a larger number of white-matter lesions, and lower episodic memory performance. INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these findings suggest that reduced cardiovascular health is associated with poorer status for brain variables that are central to age-sensitive cognitive functions, with emphasis on DA integrity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663685,N,structural,,,
Identification of physiological response functions to correct for fluctuations in resting-state fMRI related to heart rate and respiration,Neuroimage,"Kassinopoulos, Michalis,Mitsis, Georgios D,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Neuroimage. 2019 Nov 15;202:116150. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116150. Epub 2019 Sep 2.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely viewed as the gold standard for studying brain function due to its high spatial resolution and non-invasive nature. However, it is well established that changes in breathing patterns and heart rate strongly influence the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal and this, in turn, can have considerable effects on fMRI studies, particularly resting-state studies. The dynamic effects of physiological processes are often quantified by using convolution models along with simultaneously recorded physiological data. In this context, physiological response function (PRF) curves (cardiac and respiratory response functions), which are convolved with the corresponding physiological fluctuations, are commonly employed. While it has often been suggested that the PRF curves may be region- or subject-specific, it is still an open question whether this is the case. In the present study, we propose a novel framework for the robust estimation of PRF curves and use this framework to rigorously examine the implications of using population-, subject-, session- and scan-specific PRF curves. The proposed framework was tested on resting-state fMRI and physiological data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results suggest that PRF curves vary significantly across subjects and, to a lesser extent, across sessions from the same subject. These differences can be partly attributed to physiological variables such as the mean and variance of the heart rate during the scan. The proposed methodological framework can be used to obtain robust scan-specific PRF curves from data records with duration longer than 5min, exhibiting significantly improved performance compared to previously defined canonical cardiac and respiration response functions. Besides removing physiological confounds from the BOLD signal, accurate modeling of subject- (or session-/scan-) specific PRF curves is of importance in studies that involve populations with altered vascular responses, such as aging subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487547,N,methods paper,,,

Epub 2019 May 15.","BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle glucose utilization is an important component of whole-body glucose consumption in normal humans. Fluorine-18-labelled fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18) F-FDG) is a non-invasive molecular imaging probe for evaluating tissue glucose utilization. It remains unclear whether or not (18) F-FDG uptake by skeletal muscle has utility as a biomarker for metabolic derangement. We investigated the utility of measurement of muscle (18) F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography uptake as a surrogate marker for existing and incipient metabolic abnormalities. METHODS: Fluorine-18-labelled fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18) F-FDG) uptakes of insulin-sensitive organs (liver, pancreas, mesenteric visceral fat, psoas muscle, and abdominal subcutaneous fat) and their association with metabolic abnormalities were evaluated in an experimental group comprising 91 men and 66 women (mean age 49.9 +/- 11.1 years). In this cross-sectional cohort, we assessed the predictive power of the optimal cut-off (18) F-FDG uptake [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax )]. We confirmed its feasibility and reliability for diagnosis of existing and incipient metabolic derangement in the validation group (longitudinal cohort comprising 91 men and 67 women; mean age 52.6 +/- 7.9 years). RESULTS: Fluorine-18-labelled fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18) F-FDG) uptake (SUVmax ) of psoas muscle was strongly correlated with clinical metabolic parameters in the experimental group. It was positively correlated with waist circumference, body mass index, fasting glucose, triglyceride, systolic and diastolic pressure, and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (for all, P < 0.05). SUVmax of the psoas muscle also showed the best area under the curve value (0.779) as a predictor of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the experimental group. Using the optimal cut-off SUVmax of 1.34, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive, and negative predictive value for predicting existing MetS in the experimental group were 70.0%, 84.6%, 80.9%, 60.9%, and 89.2%, respectively. In the validation group, corresponding values were 47.6%, 92.3%, 86.1%, 50.0%, and 91.6%, respectively. Existing and incipient MetS were significantly higher in subjects with high (18) F-FDG uptake by the psoas muscle (SUVmax > 1.34). Subjects with higher psoas muscle SUVmax had a 3.3-fold increased risk of developing MetS (P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Fluorine-18-labelled fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18) F-FDG) uptake of psoas muscle is a promising surrogate marker for existing and incipient metabolic derangement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094095,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 26.","BACKGROUND: Chronic hypervigilance, a state of sustained alertness and hyperarousal in the absence of threat, has been shown to predict poorer clinical outcomes post-trauma. An exaggerated and persistent amygdala alerting response to affective information has been proposed as a reactivity-based, and thus indirect, marker of hypervigilance. However, because chronic hypervigilance is a persistent rather than reactive state, it should be directly observable under resting-state conditions without the need for exposure to affectively charged stimuli. OBJECTIVE: We tested resting amygdala connectivity and basal sympathetic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity as direct neural and neuroendocrine markers of chronic hypervigilance. PARTICIPANTS: 24 trauma-exposed women (age M = 22.9, SD = 5.5) and 20 no-trauma controls (age M = 21.1, SD = 3.2). MEASURES: Amygdala connectivity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and during viewing of novel and familiar affective scenes. Elevated amygdala connectivity during the viewing of novel scenes (exaggerated alerting response) and familiar scenes (persistent alerting response) was used as a reactivity-based index of hypervigilance. Resting amygdala connectivity and basal salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol were tested as neural and neuroendocrine markers of hypervigilance, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to no-trauma controls, trauma-exposed women showed greater connectivity between the left amygdala and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) both during affective processing and at rest. Exaggerated neural novelty response was associated with greater resting left amygdala-vACC connectivity and higher basal sAA, but not cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: Greater synchronization of threat-detection circuitry in the absence of threat and basal sympathetic tone might serve as complementary resting-state markers of the cognitive and physiological components of chronic hypervigilance, respectively.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529716,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 20.","Spoken word recognition in context is remarkably fast and accurate, with recognition times of approximately 200 ms, typically well before the end of the word. The neurocomputational mechanisms underlying these contextual effects are still poorly understood. This study combines source-localized electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic (EMEG) measures of real-time brain activity with multivariate representational similarity analysis to determine directly the timing and computational content of the processes evoked as spoken words are heard in context, and to evaluate the respective roles of bottom-up and predictive processing mechanisms in the integration of sensory and contextual constraints. Male and female human participants heard simple (modifier-noun) English phrases that varied in the degree of semantic constraint that the modifier (W1) exerted on the noun (W2), as in pairs, such as ""yellow banana."" We used gating tasks to generate estimates of the probabilistic predictions generated by these constraints as well as measures of their interaction with the bottom-up perceptual input for W2. Representation similarity analysis models of these measures were tested against electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic brain data across a bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal language network. Consistent with probabilistic predictive processing accounts, we found early activation of semantic constraints in frontal cortex (LBA45) as W1 was heard. The effects of these constraints (at 100 ms after W2 onset in left middle temporal gyrus and at 140 ms in left Heschl's gyrus) were only detectable, however, after the initial phonemes of W2 had been heard. Within an overall predictive processing framework, bottom-up sensory inputs are still required to achieve early and robust spoken word recognition in context.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Human listeners recognize spoken words in natural speech contexts with remarkable speed and accuracy, often identifying a word well before all of it has been heard. In this study, we investigate the brain systems that support this important capacity, using neuroimaging techniques that can track real-time brain activity during speech comprehension. This makes it possible to locate the brain areas that generate predictions about upcoming words and to show how these expectations are integrated with the evidence provided by the speech being heard. We use the timing and localization of these effects to provide the most specific account to date of how the brain achieves an optimal balance between prediction and sensory input in the interpretation of spoken language.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30459221,N,meg,,,

However, the investigation of individual differences that are related to altered appetitive learning has been almost neglected so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between neuroticism and appetitive conditioning processes. 79 subjects participated in a differential conditioning procedure in which a conditioned stimulus (CS+) was paired with a reward (money) after a fast behavioral response, while a second conditioned stimulus (CS-) was never followed by a reward, irrespective of the behavioral response. As a main result, neuroticism correlated negatively with the underlying neural processes of appetitive conditioning in females, but not in males. In detail, higher levels of neuroticism were associated with decreased neural responses in the left (p=.001) and right amygdala (p=.011), left (p=.063) and right (p=.019) nucleus accumbens, and left (p=.002) and right (p=.021) orbitofrontal cortex (all results are family-wise-error-corrected). The present results support previous findings, which also showed an inverse sex-specific effect in the context of neuroticism and emotional processing in females. In addition, the findings suggest that neuroticism is not solely linked to increased amygdala sensitivity during the processing of negative stimuli but also to decreased neural responses when processing rewarding stimuli.

Supporting this, most Parkinson's disease patients experience autonomic non-motor symptoms such as constipation, often years prior to diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study gastrointestinal transit time, colonic volume, and peristaltic movements in idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder patients, a prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease or Dementia with Lewy bodies. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were included and compared to previously published data from Parkinson's disease patients and controls. Gastrointestinal transit time, computed tomography-based volume estimation, and colonic motility were performed as markers of gastrointestinal function and autonomic involvement. Subjective constipation symptoms were evaluated with two different questionnaires. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal transit time was increased in 33% (p=0.039) and colonic volume in 48% (p=0.0049) of patients. Colonic transit time measured by the 3D-Transit system was increased in 70% (p=0.0326) and the number of fast peristaltic colonic movements was reduced (p=0.015). Mean small intestinal transit time was comparable to Parkinson's disease patients, although not significantly different compared to controls (p=0.18). Subjective constipation symptoms were present in 18 or 41%, depending on type of questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Total gastrointestinal transit time, colonic volume, and 3D-Transit colonic transit time were significantly increased compared to controls, although not to the extent seen in medicated Parkinson's patients. Limited correlation was seen between subjective constipation and objective markers.

But how does such social information affect the neural generation of affective experience, and are the brain mechanisms involved distinct from those that mediate other types of expectation effects? Here, we used fMRI to dissociate the brain mediators of social influence and associative learning effects on pain. Participants viewed symbolic depictions of other participants' pain ratings (social information) and classically conditioned pain-predictive cues before experiencing painful heat. Social information and conditioned stimuli each had significant effects on pain ratings, and both effects were mediated by self-reported expectations. Yet, these effects were mediated by largely separable brain activity patterns, involving different large-scale functional networks.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mean blood pressure (MBP), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and resting regional brain activity in healthy human subjects. Pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were performed immediately following a laboratory microneurography recording of MSNA and BP measurement in 31 young, healthy normotensive subjects. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) correlated significantly with resting MBP levels in the region encompassing the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM), dorsolateral pons, and insular, prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex displayed greater resting connectivity strength within the RVLM in the lower compared with the higher MBP group. No significant differences in CBF were found when subjects were divided based on their MSNA levels. These results suggest that even subtle differences in resting MBP are associated with significant differences in resting activity in brain regions, which are well known to play a role in cardiovascular function.

We used ultra-high-field (7 tesla) fMRI to measure human brain activity at 1.1 mm resolution while participants completed a working memory task. Consistent with prior work, participants were less accurate and responded more slowly with increasing memory load-signs of increasing task difficulty. Whole-brain fMRI analysis revealed increased activity in multiple cortical areas with increasing working memory load, including frontal and parietal cortex, dorsal cingulate, supplementary motor area, and anterior insula. Several dopamine-rich midbrain nuclei, such as the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, also exhibited load-dependent increases in activation. To investigate PAG involvement during cognitive engagement, we developed an automated method for segmenting and spatially normalizing the PAG. Analyses using cross-validated linear support vector machines showed that the PAG discriminated high versus low working memory load conditions with 95% accuracy in individual subjects based on activity increases in lateral and ventrolateral PAG. Effect sizes in the PAG were comparable in magnitude to those in many of the cortical areas. These findings suggest that cognitive control is not only associated with cortical activity in the frontal and parietal lobes, but also with increased activity in the subcortical PAG and other midbrain regions involved in the regulation of autonomic nervous system function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Functional neuroimaging in humans has shown that cognitive control engages multiple corticostriatal networks and brainstem nuclei, but theoretical advances suggest that the periaqueductal gray (PAG) should also be engaged during cognitively demanding tasks. Recent advances in ultra-high-field fMRI provided an opportunity to obtain the first evidence that increased activation of intermediate and rostral portions of lateral and ventrolateral PAG columns in humans is modulated by cognitive load.

Patients with frontotemporal dementia show profound social cognition deficits and atrophy in regions implicated in autonomic emotional responses (insula, amygdala, prefrontal cortex), yet objective measures of facial expressiveness and physiological arousal have been relatively unexplored. We investigated psychophysiological responses (surface facial electromyography (EMG); skin conductance level (SCL)) to emotional stimuli in 25 behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, 14 semantic dementia (SD) patients, and 24 healthy older controls, while viewing emotionally positive, neutral, or negative video clips. Voxel-based morphometry was conducted to identify neural correlates of responses. Unlike controls, patients with bvFTD did not show differential facial EMG responses according to emotion condition, whereas SD patients showed increased zygomaticus responses to both positive and neutral videos. Controls showed greater arousal (SCL) when viewing positive and negative videos; however, both bvFTD and SD groups showed no change in SCL across conditions. Regardless of group membership, right insula damage was associated with dampened zygomaticus responses to positive film stimuli. Change in arousal (SCL) was associated with lower integrity of the caudate, amygdala, and temporal pole. Our results demonstrate that while bvFTD patients show an overall dampening of responses, SD patients appear to show incongruous facial emotional expressions. Abnormal responding is related to cortical and subcortical brain atrophy. These results identify potential mechanisms for the abnormal social behaviour in bvFTD and SD and demonstrate that psychophysiological responses are an important mechanism underpinning normal socioemotional functioning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488224,N,emg,,,

Network analysis was employed to explore connectivity within a 'regulatory-subnetwork' of brain regions involved in autonomic and respiratory regulation, and over the whole-brain. Modularity, the extent of network organization into separate modules, was significantly reduced in the regulatory-subnetwork, and the whole-brain, in SUDEP and high-risk. Increased participation, a local measure of inter-modular belonging, was evident in SUDEP and high-risk groups, particularly among thalamic structures. The medial prefrontal thalamus was increased in SUDEP compared with all other control groups, including high-risk. Patterns of hub topology were similar in SUDEP and high-risk, but were more extensive in low-risk patients, who displayed greater hub prevalence and a radical reorganization of hubs in the subnetwork. SUDEP is associated with reduced functional organization among cortical and sub-cortical brain regions mediating autonomic and respiratory regulation. Living high-risk subjects demonstrated similar patterns, suggesting such network measures may provide prospective risk-indicating value, though a crucial difference between SUDEP and high-risk was altered connectivity of the medial thalamus in SUDEP, which was also elevated compared with all sub-groups.

Less is known about if and how risk exposure in early adulthood influences late-life brain health. Objective: To determine the associations between vascular risk in early adulthood, midlife, and late life with late-life brain structure and pathology using measures of white matter-hyperintensity volume, beta-amyloid load, and whole-brain and hippocampal volumes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective longitudinal cohort study, Insight 46, is part of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, which commenced in 1946. Participants had vascular risk factors evaluated at ages 36 years (early adulthood), 53 years (midlife), and 69 years (early late life). Participants were assessed with multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and florbetapir-amyloid positron emission tomography scans between May 2015 and January 2018 at University College London. Participants with at least 1 available imaging measure, vascular risk measurements at 1 or more points, and no dementia were included in analyses. Exposures: Office-based Framingham Heart study-cardiovascular risk scores (FHS-CVS) were derived at ages 36, 53, and 69 years using systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication usage, smoking, diabetic status, and body mass index. Analysis models adjusted for age at imaging, sex, APOE genotype, socioeconomic position, and, where appropriate, total intracranial volume. Main Outcomes and Measures: White matter-hyperintensity volume was generated from T1/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scans using an automated technique and whole-brain volume and hippocampal volume were generated from automated in-house pipelines; beta-amyloid status was determined using a gray matter/eroded subcortical white matter standardized uptake value ratio threshold of 0.61. Results: A total of 502 participants were assessed as part of Insight 46, and 463 participants (236 male [51.0%]) with at least 1 available imaging measure (mean [SD] age at imaging, 70.7 [0.7] years; 83 beta-amyloid positive [18.2%]) who fulfilled eligibility criteria were included. Among them, FHS-CVS increased with age (36 years: median [interquartile range], 2.7% [1.5%-3.6%]; 53 years: 10.9% [6.7%-15.6%]; 69 years: 24.3% [14.9%-34.9%]). At all points, these scores were associated with smaller whole-brain volumes (36 years: beta coefficient per 1% increase, -3.6 [95% CI, -7.0 to -0.3]; 53 years: -0.8 [95% CI, -1.5 to -0.08]; 69 years: -0.6 [95% CI, -1.1 to -0.2]) and higher white matter-hyperintensity volume (exponentiated coefficient: 36 years, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01-1.18]; 53 years, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00-1.04]; 69 years, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.02]), with largest effect sizes at age 36 years. At no point were FHS-CVS results associated with beta-amyloid status. Conclusions and Relevance: Higher vascular risk is associated with smaller whole-brain volume and greater white matter-hyperintensity volume at age 69 to 71 years, with the strongest association seen with early adulthood vascular risk. There was no evidence that higher vascular risk influences amyloid deposition, at least up to age 71 years. Reducing vascular risk with appropriate interventions should be considered from early adulthood to maximize late-life brain health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682678,N,no phys of interest,,,

Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center cohort study uses 15oxygen positron emission tomography data obtained in a neurosciences critical care unit from February 1998 through July 2014 and analyzed from April 2018 through August 2019. Patients with TBI requiring intracranial pressure monitoring and control participants were recruited. Exposures: Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2), and oxygen extraction fraction. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ratios (CBF/CMRO2 and CBF/CBV) were calculated. Ischemic brain volume was compared with jugular venous saturation and brain tissue oximetry. Results: A total of 68 patients with TBI and 27 control participants were recruited. Results from 1 patient with TBI and 7 health volunteers were excluded. Sixty-eight patients with TBI (13 female [19%]; median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 29 [22-47] years) underwent 90 studies at early (day 1 [n = 17]), intermediate (days 2-5 [n = 54]), and late points (days 6-10 [n = 19]) and were compared with 20 control participants (5 female [25%]; median [IQR] age, 43 [31-47] years). The global CBF and CMRO2 findings for patients with TBI were less than the ranges for control participants at all stages (median [IQR]: CBF, 26 [22-30] mL/100 mL/min vs 38 [29-49] mL/100 mL/min; P < .001; CMRO2, 62 [55-71] mumol/100 mL/min vs 131 [101-167] mumol/100 mL/min; P < .001). Early CBF reductions showed a trend of high oxygen extraction fraction (suggesting classical ischemia), but this was inconsistent at later phases. Ischemic brain volume was elevated even in the absence of intracranial hypertension and highest at less than 24 hours after TBI (median [IQR], 36 [10-82] mL), but many patients showed later increases (median [IQR] 6-10 days after TBI, 24 [4-42] mL; across all points: patients, 10 [5-39] mL vs control participants, 1 [0-3] mL; P < 001). Ischemic brain volume was a poor indicator of jugular venous saturation and brain tissue oximetry. Patients' CBF/CMRO2 ratio was higher than controls (median [IQR], 0.42 [0.35-0.49] vs 0.3 [0.28-0.33]; P < .001) and their CBF/CBV ratio lower (median [IQR], 7.1 [6.4-7.9] vs 12.3 [11.0-14.0]; P < .001), suggesting abnormal flow-metabolism coupling and vascular reactivity. Patients' CBV was higher than controls (median [IQR], 3.7 [3.4-4.1] mL/100 mL vs 3.0 [2.7-3.6] mL/100 mL; P < .001); although values were lower in patients with intracranial hypertension, these were still greater than controls (median [IQR], 3.7 [3.2-4.0] vs 3.0 [2.7-3.6] mL/100 mL; P = .002), despite more profound reductions in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (median [IQR], 4.3 [4.1-4.6] kPa vs 4.7 [4.3-4.9] kPa; P = .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Ischemia is common early, detectable up to 10 days after TBI, possible without intracranial hypertension, and inconsistently detected by jugular or brain tissue oximetry. There is substantial between-patient and within-patient pathophysiological heterogeneity; ischemia and hyperemia commonly coexist, possibly reflecting abnormalities in flow-metabolism coupling. Increased CBV may contribute to intracranial hypertension but can coexist with abnormal CBF/CBV ratios. These results emphasize the need to consider cerebrovascular pathophysiological complexity when managing patients with TBI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31710336,N,no phys of interest,,,

The present study sought to investigate the agreement of RFR or dPR with other pressure-derived indexes (instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR] or fractional flow reserve), the sensitivity of RFR or dPR for anatomic or hemodynamic stenosis severity, and the prognostic implications of RFR or dPR compared with iFR Methods: RFR and dPR were calculated from resting pressure tracings by an independent core laboratory in 1024 vessels (435 patients). The changes in resting physiological indexes according to diameter stenosis were compared among iFR, RFR, and dPR. Among 115 patients who underwent (13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography, the changes in those indexes according to basal and hyperemic stenosis resistance and absolute hyperemic myocardial blood flow were compared. The association between resting physiological indexes and the risk of 2-year vessel-oriented composite outcomes (a composite of cardiac death, vessel-related myocardial infarction, and vessel-related ischemia-driven revascularization) was analyzed among 864 deferred vessels. RESULTS: Both RFR and dPR showed a significant correlation with iFR ( R=0.979, P<0.001 for RFR; and R=0.985, P<0.001 for dPR), which was higher than that with fractional flow reserve ( R=0.822, P<0.001; and R=0.819, P<0.001, respectively). RFR and dPR showed a very high agreement with iFR (C index, 0.987 and 0.993). Percent difference of iFR, RFR, and dPR according to the increase in anatomic and hemodynamic severity was almost identical. The diagnostic performance of iFR, RFR, and dPR was not different in the prediction of myocardial ischemia defined by both low hyperemic myocardial blood flow and low coronary flow reserve by (13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography. All resting physiological indexes showed significant association with the risk of 2-year vessel-oriented composite outcomes (iFR per 0.1 increase: hazard ratio, 0.514 [95% CI, 0.370-0.715], P<0.001; RFR per 0.1 increase: hazard ratio, 0.524 [95% CI, 0.378-0.725], P<0.001; dPR per 0.1 increase: hazard ratio, 0.587 [95% CI, 0.436-0.791], P<0.001) in deferred vessels. CONCLUSIONS: All resting pressure-derived physiological indexes (iFR, RFR, and dPR) can be used as invasive tools to guide treatment strategy in patients with coronary artery disease.

This study evaluated changes in network connectivity associated with usage of High-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM((R)) ; Brain State Technologies, Scottsdale, AZ), a closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology, for military-related traumatic stress. METHODS: Eighteen participants (17 males, mean age 41 years [SD = 7], 15 active duty) enrolled in an IRB approved pilot trial for symptoms of military-related traumatic stress. Participants received 19.5 (1.1) HIRREM sessions over 12 days. Symptoms, physiological and functional measures, and whole brain resting MRI were collected before and after HIRREM. Six whole brain functional networks were evaluated using summary variables and community structure of predefined networks. Pre to postintervention change was analyzed using paired-sample statistical tests. RESULTS: Postintervention, there was an overall increase in connectivity of the default mode network (P = .0094). There were decreases of community structure in both the anterior portion of the default mode (medial prefrontal cortex, P = .0097) and in the sensorimotor (P = .005) network. There were no statistically significant changes at the whole brain level, or in the central executive, salience, or other networks analyzed. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in clinical symptoms, as well as autonomic cardiovascular regulation, which have been reported previously. CONCLUSIONS: Use of closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology (HIRREM) was associated with connectivity changes in the default mode and sensorimotor networks, in directions that may have explained the subjects' clinical improvements.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30302866,N,no phys of interest,,,

Effects of nVNS vs sham stimulation on subject responses to five noxious thermal stimuli (applied to left lower extremity), were measured in 30 healthy subjects (n = 15 sham and n = 15 nVNS), with fMRI and physiological galvanic skin response (GSR). With repeated noxious thermal stimuli a group x time analysis showed a significantly (p < .001) decreased response with nVNS in bilateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), left dorsoposterior insular cortex, bilateral paracentral lobule, bilateral medial dorsal thalamus, right anterior cingulate cortex, and right orbitofrontal cortex. A group x time x GSR analysis showed a significantly decreased response in the nVNS group (p < .0005) bilaterally in SI, lower and mid medullary brainstem, and inferior occipital cortex. Finally, nVNS treatment showed decreased activity in pronociceptive brainstem nuclei (e.g. the reticular nucleus and rostral ventromedial medulla) and key autonomic integration nuclei (e.g. the rostroventrolateral medulla, nucleus ambiguous, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve). In aggregate, noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation reduced the physiological response to noxious thermal stimuli and impacted neural circuits important for pain processing and autonomic output.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759089,N,no corr,,,

In the present study, we investigated how 5-HTTLPR impacts on memory retrieval under stress and related neural activity by reanalyzing a small genetic neuroimaging data set. Twenty-seven healthy male volunteers participated in both the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a respective control procedure and then their brain activity was measured with functional MRI (fMRI) while they performed an emotional-face-recognition task. Sixteen participants were carriers of the short allele (ss/sl carriers) and 11 were homozygous for the long allele (ll carriers). Genotype groups were compared with respect to stress-related physiological changes, memory performance, and brain activity. No significant genotype-dependent effects on memory performance or cortisol levels were found. The ss/sl carriers showed significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than the ll carriers, independent of stress. The ss/sl carriers reported stronger stress-induced nervous mood than the ll carriers. Our fMRI data revealed that the ss/sl carriers showed significantly weaker left hippocampus activation and stronger dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) deactivation when retrieving memories under stress as compared with the ll carriers. Subsequent analyses revealed that the distinct hippocampal activation pattern in both genotypes was associated with stress-induced cortisol elevation, while the distinct dmPFC activation pattern in both genotypes was associated with stress-induced changes in reaction times. Our results thus add new evidence that serotonin signaling modulates neural activity in the hippocampus and dmPFC during memory retrieval under acute psychosocial stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264389,N,no corr,,,

Nitrated alpha-SYN is an undesirable modification associated with oxidative and nitrative damage and has been found extensively in brain, gastrointestinal(GI) tract and blood cells in PD. We aim to investigate the presence of nitrated alpha-SYN in minor salivary gland biopsy in PD. Patients with PD and age-matched controls underwent minor salivary gland biopsy. Motor impairment was assessed by Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III in off-state. 11C-methyl-N-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (11C-CFT) DAT-PET scan was performed in all subjects. Immunohistochemical staining for nitrated alpha-SYN was performed in the minor salivary gland tissues. The minor salivary gland tissues of 8 PD cases and 7 controls with early stage (H-Y stage 1-2) were detected. All PD patients showed asymmetrical and reduction of (11)C-CFT uptake in the caudate, anterior and posterior putamen, while all control subjects showed normal DAT-PET scan. Positive nitrated alpha-SYN immunostaining was observed in all PD patients (8/8,100%) but not in control subjects (0/7). The results were consistent well with that of DAT-PET. These nitrated alpha-synuclein positive structures were mainly located in the periacinar stroma in PD patients. Our result suggests that nitrated alpha-SYN exists in the early stage and is probably a promising biomarker for PD. Minor salivary gland is an ideal site for alpha-SYN nitration detection. Despite of the small number of subjects, attention should be given to alpha-SYN nitration in PD and more investigations on nitrated alpha-SYN in different sites and large sample using should be explored in future.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946930,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2019 Aug 22.","We review our recent data obtained on the cortical and subcortical components of the human sympathetic connectome - the network of regions involved in the sympathetic control of blood pressure. Specifically, we functionally identified the human homologue of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the primary premotor sympathetic nucleus in the medulla responsible for generating sympathetic vasoconstrictor drive. By performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain at the same time as recording muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), via a microlectrode inserted into the common peroneal nerve, we are able to identify areas of the brain involved in the generation of sympathetic outflow to the muscle vascular bed, a major contributor to blood pressure regulation. Together with functional connectivity analysis of areas identified through MSNA-coupled fMRI, we have established key components of the human sympathetic connectome and their roles in the control of blood pressure. Whilst our studies confirm the role of lower brainstem regions such as the NTS, CVLM and RVLM in baroreflex control of MSNA, our findings indicate that the insula - hypothalamus - PAG - RVLM circuitry is tightly coupled to MSNA at rest. This fits with data obtained from experimental animals, but also emphasizes the role of areas above the brainstem in the regulation of blood pressure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446130,Y,data from previous studies,,,

Epub 2019 Feb 21.","In Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), fluctuations in ongoing thoughts (i.e., mind-wandering) often take the form of rigid and intrusive perseverative cognition, such as worry. Here, we sought to characterise the neural correlates of mind-wandering and perseverative cognition, alongside autonomic nervous system indices of central arousal, notably pupil dilation. We implemented a protocol incorporating the dynamic delivery of thought-probes within a functional neuroimaging task. Sixteen individuals with GAD and sixteen matched healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging with concomitant pupillometry. Participants performed a series of low-demand tracking tasks, responding to occasional changes in a target stimulus. Such a task is typically accompanied by self-generated, off-task thinking. Thought-probes were triggered based on an individual's response time (RT) when responding to the change in the target. Subjective reports showed that long RT predicted off-task thinking/mind-wandering. Moreover, long RT and mind-wandering were also associated with larger pupil diameter. This effect was exaggerated in GAD patients during perseverative cognition. Within brain, during both pre-target periods and target events, there were distinct neural correlates for mind-wandering (e.g., anterior cingulate and paracingulate activation at target onset) and perseverative cognition (e.g., opposite patterns of activation in posterior cingulate and cerebellum at target onset in HC and GAD). Results suggest that not only attention systems but also sensory-motor cortices are important during off-task states. Interestingly, changes across the 'default mode network' also tracked fluctuations in pupillary size. Autonomic expression in pupillary changes mirrors brain activation patterns that occur during different forms of repetitive thinking.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798009,N,no phys of interest,,,

METHODS: Adult stroke survivors at least 6 months after stroke with a visibly obvious gait abnormality or reduced 2-min walk distance were included in a two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial of complex intervention with blinded assessments. Participants received a 10 week, bi-weekly, 30 min treadmill programme at an aerobic training intensity (55%-85% heart rate maximum), either with or without simultaneous cognitive demands. Outcome was measured at 0, 11 and 22 weeks. The primary assessment involved 2-min walk tests with and without cognitive distraction to investigate the dual-task effect on walking and cognition; secondary results were the Short Form Health Survey 36, EuroQol-5D-5L, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and step activity. RESULTS: Fifty stroke patients were included; 43 received allocated training and 45 completed all assessments.

In the current fMRI study involving healthy adult human volunteers, we investigated interactions between proximity, direction (approach vs. retreat), and speed during a dynamic threat-of-shock paradigm. As a measure of threat-evoked physiological arousal, skin conductance responses were recorded during fMRI scanning. Some brain regions tracked individual threat-related factors, and others were also sensitive to combinations of these variables. In particular, signals in the anterior insula tracked the interaction between proximity and direction where approach versus retreat responses were stronger when threat was closer compared with farther. A parallel proximity-by-direction interaction was also observed in physiological skin conductance responses. In the right amygdala, we observed a proximity by direction interaction, but intriguingly in the opposite direction as the anterior insula; retreat versus approach responses were stronger when threat was closer compared with farther. In the right bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, we observed an effect of threat proximity, whereas in the right periaqueductal gray/midbrain we observed an effect of threat direction and a proximity by direction by speed interaction (the latter was detected in exploratory analyses but not in a voxelwise fashion).

However, factors associated with the antipruritic effects of acupuncture have yet to be clarified. In a randomized, sham-controlled, crossover trial, we investigated the antipruritic effects of acupuncture against histamine-induced itch in healthy volunteers. Autonomic changes using heart rate variability (HRV) and brain connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were also assessed to identify physiological factors associated with the acupuncture response. Acupuncture significantly reduced itch intensity and skin blood perfusion as assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging compared to sham control, indicating the antipruritic effects of acupuncture. In responder and non-responder analysis, the power of normalized high frequency (HF norm) was significantly higher, while the power of normalized low frequency (LF norm) and LF/HF ratio were significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders, suggesting the acupuncture response involved parasympathetic activation. In fMRI analysis, the putamen and the posterior part of the midcingulate cortex (pMCC) were positively connected to itch and negatively correlated with itch intensity in responders. These results suggest that parasympathetic activity and functional connectivity of the putamen and pMCC could be associated with antipruritic response to acupuncture.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914919,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 3.","BACKGROUND: MR Imaging has shown atrophy in brainstem regions that were linked to autonomic dysfunction in epilepsy patients. The brainstem projects to and modulates the activation state of several wide-spread cortical/subcortical regions. The goal was to investigate 1. Impact of brainstem atrophy on gray matter connectivity of cortical/subcortical structures and autonomic control. 2. Impact on the modulation of cortical/subcortical functional connectivity. METHODS: 11 controls and 18 patients with non-lesional focal epilepsy (FE) underwent heart rate variability (HRV) measurements and a 3T MRI (T1 in all subjects, task-free fMRI in 7 controls/ 12 FE). The brainstem was extracted, and atrophy assessed using deformation-based-morphometry. The age-corrected z-scores of the mean Jacobian determinants were extracted from 71 5x5x5 mm grids placed in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function. Cortical and non-brainstem subcortical gray matter atrophy was assessed with voxel-based-morphometry and mean age corrected z-scores of the modulated gray matter volumes extracted from 380 cortical/subcortical rois. The profile similarity index was used to characterize the impact of brainstem atrophy on gray matter connectivity. The fMRI was preprocessed in SPM12/Conn17 and the BOLD signal extracted from 398 ROIs (16 brainstem). A dynamic task-free analysis approach was used to identify activation states. Connectivity HRV relationship were assessed with Spearman rank correlations. RESULTS: HRV was negatively correlated with reduced brainstem right hippocampus/parahippocampus gray matter connectivity in controls (p<.05, FDR) and reduced brainstem to right parietal cortex, lingual gyrus, left hippocampus/amygdala, parahippocampus, temporal pole, and bilateral anterior thalamus connectivity in FE (p<.05, FDR). Dynamic task-free fMRI analysis identified 22 states. The strength of the functional brainstem/cortical connectivity of state 15 was negatively associated with HRV (r=-0.5, p=.03) and positively with decreased brainstem-cortical (0.49, p=.03) gray matter connectivity. CONCLUSION: The findings of this small pilot study suggest that impaired brainstem-cortex gray matter connectivity in FE negatively affects the brainstem's ability to control cortical activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203171,N,FC study,,,

Despite substantial comorbidity between alcohol dependence (ALC) and anxiety disorders and reports of altered negative emotion processing in ALC, neural correlates of FCE in this clinical population remain unknown. Here, we used a 2-day fear learning paradigm in 43 healthy participants and 43 individuals with ALC at the National Institutes of Health. Main outcomes of this multimodal study included structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging, clinical measures, as well as skin conductance responses (SCRs) to confirm differential conditioning. Successful FCE was demonstrated across participants by differential SCRs in the conditioning phase and no difference in SCRs to the conditioned stimuli in the extinction phase. The ALC group showed significantly reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in the right amygdala during conditioning (Cohen's d = .89, P(FWE) = .037) and in the left amygdala during fear renewal (Cohen's d = .68, P(FWE) = .039). Right amygdala activation during conditioning was significantly correlated with ALC severity (r = .39, P(Bonferroni) = .009), depressive symptoms (r = .37, P(Bonferroni) = .015), trait anxiety (r = .41, P(Bonferroni) = .006), and perceived stress (r = .45, P(Bonferroni) = .002). Our data suggest that individuals with ALC have dysregulated fear learning, in particular, dysregulated neural activation patterns, in the amygdala. Furthermore, amygdala activation during fear conditioning was associated with ALC-related clinical measures. The FCE paradigm may be a promising tool to investigate structures involved in negative affect regulation, which might inform the development of novel treatment approaches for ALC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31702089,N,no corr,,,

It has frequently been shown to relate to the function of brain areas like the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while the role of structural properties, like white matter tracts in these regions, has been less studied. We employed diffusion tensor imaging to determine structural white matter connectivity (cingulum and uncinate fasciculus) correlates of contextual pavlovian fear extinction indicators measured through functional magnetic resonance imaging, skin conductance responses (SCRs) and self-reports of valence, arousal and contingency in 93 healthy individuals. Higher fractional anisotropy values in the hippocampal cingulum were significantly related to higher SCRs during extinction of contextual conditioned responses (explained variance: 11.2%) as an indicator of extinction deficits on the level of physiological arousal. However, FA was neither related to any of the other fear extinction measures, nor did we find associations with functional extinction responses in the hippocampus or mPFC. Trait anxiety was a significant moderator of the SCR-hippocampal cingulum association (explained variance: 32.09%). The data add evidence for a critical role of the hippocampal formation in contextual pavlovian extinction, and, together with the strong effect of trait anxiety, may have implications for the development of anxiety disorders where contextual extinction learning deficits are observed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629196,N,structural,,,

Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC, ventromedial PFC, and amygdala activity varied with the behavioral response (i.e., SCR and self-reported stress). These results suggest the PFC and amygdala support processes that are important for the expression and regulation of the emotional response to stress, and that stress-related PFC and amygdala activity underlie interindividual variability in peripheral physiologic measures of the stress response.

Epub 2019 May 17.","A new radio-HPLC detection system for measuring radioactivity in plasma samples during Positron Emission Tomography [PET] studies was developed. It is based on detecting both the positron and one of the annihilation photons. The system focused on improving the measurement of radioactivity concentrations on an unmetabolized positron emitting a radiopharmaceutical [PER] in the presence of its radioactive metabolites, all containing the same positron emitter. This paper presents a new detection configuration that improves the minimal detectible activity (MDA), simplify the measuring systems and reduces the error caused by the metabolites. The detector is based on a plastic scintillator and a BGO scintillation crystal, that produces different light output spectra for signal and noise events. By summing the positron and the annihilated photon light outputs, different spectra are obtained for the metabolite and for the parent compound tracer and for tracer marked by different positron emitting isotopes. This new detection system can improve quantitative analysis of plasma samples. The spectrum change provides up to a three-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to the currently used detection systems that measure only the annihilation coincidence events. Results showed that for (11)C the MDA was improved by approximately 520%. Furthermore, it provides the additional advantage of reliability by providing a method for separating the signal and noise readings from the gross detector readout. Accurate reconstruction algorithm of the signal was achieved over a wide measuring range even when the signal was only 5% of the gross measurement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376719,N,no phys of interest,,,

By analyzing fMRI and (electro-) physiological signals concurrently acquired during sleep, we found that widespread fMRI signal changes often co-occur with electroencephalography (EEG) K-complexes, signatures of sub-cortical arousal, and episodic drops in finger skin vascular tone; phenomena that have been associated with intermittent sympathetic activity.

Epub 2019 Jun 4.","Background and Purpose- After large-vessel intracranial occlusion, the fate of the ischemic penumbra, and ultimately final infarct volume, largely depends on tissue perfusion. In this study, we evaluated whether blood pressure reduction and sustained relative hypotension during endovascular thrombectomy are associated with infarct progression and functional outcome. Methods- We identified consecutive patients with large-vessel intracranial occlusion ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy at 2 comprehensive stroke centers. Intraprocedural mean arterial pressure (MAP) was monitored throughout the procedure. DeltaMAP was calculated as the difference between admission MAP and lowest MAP during endovascular thrombectomy until recanalization. Sustained hypotension was measured as the area between admission MAP and continuous measurements of intraprocedural MAP (aMAP). Final infarct volume was measured using magnetic resonance imaging at 24 hours, and functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at discharge and 90 days. Associations with outcome were analyzed using linear and ordinal multivariable logistic regression. Results- Three hundred ninety patients (mean age 71+/-14 years, mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 17) were included in the study; of these, 280 (72%) achieved Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2B/3 reperfusion. Eighty-seven percent of patients experienced MAP reductions during endovascular thrombectomy (mean 31+/-20 mm Hg). DeltaMAP was associated with greater infarct growth ( P=0.036) and final infarct volume ( P=0.035). Mean DeltaMAP among patients with favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) was 20+/-21 mm Hg compared with 30+/-24 mm Hg among patients with poor outcome ( P=0.002). In the multivariable analysis, DeltaMAP was independently associated with higher (worse) modified Rankin Scale scores at discharge (adjusted odds ratio per 10 mm Hg, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.32; P=0.009) and at 90 days (adjusted odds ratio per 10 mm Hg, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.07-1.38; P=0.003). The association between aMAP and outcome was also significant at discharge ( P=0.002) and 90 days ( P=0.001). Conclusions- Blood pressure reduction before recanalization is associated with larger infarct volumes and worse functional outcomes for patients affected by large-vessel intracranial occlusion stroke.

Thus, the aim of the current study is to examine the similarities between neural networks derived from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA to explore how these methods relate to each other. We analyzed the data of a previously published study with the three methods and compared the results by performing (partial) correlation and multiple regression analysis. Our findings reveal that neural networks resulting from RSA, UNIVAR, and FCA methods are highly similar to each other even after ruling out the effect of anatomical proximity between the network nodes.

The localization of the hyperintensity was found to be consistent between individuals and slices and in good correspondence to a histological atlas and a meta-analytic map of fMRI-based NTS activation.

We here investigated how both stress reactivity and stress recovery are reflected in whole-brain network topology and how changes in functional connectivity relate to other stress measures. Healthy young males (n=67) completed the Trier Social Stress Test or a control task. From 60min before until 105min after stress onset, blocks of resting-state fMRI were acquired. Subjective, autonomic, and endocrine measures of the stress response were assessed throughout the experiment. Whole-brain network topology was quantified using Eigenvector centrality (EC) mapping, which detects central hubs of a network. Stress influenced subjective affect, autonomic activity, and endocrine measures. EC differences between groups as well as before and after stress exposure were found in the thalamus, due to widespread connectivity changes in the brain. Stress-driven EC increases in the thalamus were significantly correlated with subjective stress ratings and showed non-significant trends for a correlation with heart rate variability and saliva cortisol. Furthermore, increases in thalamic EC and in saliva cortisol persisted until 105min after stress onset.

In a multicenter clinical trial on PD/AG patients we investigated in three sub-samples whether GLRB allelic variation (A/G; A-allele identified as <<risk>>) in the single nucleotide polymorphism rs7688285 was associated with autonomic (behavioral avoidance test BAT; n=267 patients) and neural (differential fear conditioning; n=49 patients, n=38 controls) measures, and furthermore with responding towards exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, n=184 patients). An interaction of genotype with current PD/AG diagnosis (PD/AG vs. controls; fMRI data only) and their modification after CBT was tested as well. Exploratory fMRI results prior to CBT, revealed A-allele carriers irrespective of diagnostic status to show overall higher BOLD activation in the hippocampus, motor cortex (MC) and insula. Differential activation in the MC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula was found in the interaction genotype X diagnosis. Differential activation in ACC and hippocampus was present in differential fear learning. ACC activation was modified after treatment, while no overall rs7688285 dependent effect on clinical outcomes was found. On the behavioral level, A-allele carriers showed pronounced fear reactivity prior to CBT which partially normalized afterwards.

Epub 2019 Feb 27.","KEY POINTS: Nausea is an adverse experience characterised by alterations in autonomic and cerebral function. Susceptibility to nausea is difficult to predict, but machine learning has yet to be applied to this field of study. The severity of nausea that individuals experience is related to the underlying morphology (shape) of the subcortex, namely of the amygdala, caudate and putamen; a functional brain network related to nausea severity was identified, which included the thalamus, cingulate cortices (anterior, mid- and posterior), caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens. Sympathetic nervous system function and sympathovagal balance, by heart rate variability, was closely related to both this nausea-associated anatomical variation and the functional connectivity network, and machine learning accurately predicted susceptibility or resistance to nausea. These novel anatomical and functional brain biomarkers for nausea severity may permit objective identification of individuals susceptible to nausea, using artificial intelligence/machine learning; brain data may be useful to identify individuals more susceptible to nausea. ABSTRACT: Nausea is a highly individual and variable experience. The central processing of nausea remains poorly understood, although numerous influential factors have been proposed, including brain structure and function, as well as autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. We investigated the role of these factors in nausea severity and if susceptibility to nausea could be predicted using machine learning. Twenty-eight healthy participants (15 males; mean age 24 years) underwent quantification of resting sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity by heart rate variability. All were exposed to a 10-min motion-sickness video during fMRI. Neuroanatomical shape differences of the subcortex and functional brain networks associated with the severity of nausea were investigated. A machine learning neural network was trained to predict nausea susceptibility, or resistance, using resting ANS data and detected brain features. Increasing nausea scores positively correlated with shape variation of the left amygdala, right caudate and bilateral putamen (corrected P = 0.05). A functional brain network linked to increasing nausea severity was identified implicating the thalamus, anterior, middle and posterior cingulate cortices, caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens (corrected P = 0.043). Both neuroanatomical differences and the functional nausea-brain network were closely related to sympathetic nervous system activity. Using these data, a machine learning model predicted susceptibility to nausea with an overall accuracy of 82.1%. Nausea severity relates to underlying subcortical morphology and a functional brain network; both measures are potential biomarkers in trials of anti-nausea therapies. The use of machine learning should be further investigated as an objective means to develop models predicting nausea susceptibility.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30629751,N,structural,,,

Despite its relevance, it remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to fill this gap by verifying and characterizing a frontal negative fluctuation of the event-related brain potentials (ERP) emerging in conditions of interpersonal guilt. Paired participants would earn money if both performed correctly a dot estimation task (both right); otherwise, both would lose a similar amount (self wrong, partner wrong, and both wrong conditions). The reported feeling of guilt was noticeable in the self wrong condition, which yielded a frontal negativity between 300 and 500 ms after the onset of performance feedback. The amplitude of this fluctuation, however, did not correlate with the amount of guilt reported by the participants, whereas both these values did so with standard measures of empathy. Neither anxiety (trait or state) nor arousal (skin conductance response) seemed to relate to this negativity. A neural source (LORETA) analysis established its generators in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region linked to guilt in fMRI studies but also, importantly, to empathy. The frontal negative fluctuation thus might reflect empathic processes contributing to achieve feelings of interpersonal guilt.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463714,N,eeg,,,

We hypothesised that CoQ10 supplementation reduced pain better than pregabalin alone via reducing brain activity, mitochondrial oxidative stress, inflammation, and increasing antioxidant levels in pregabalin-treated FM patients. A double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Eleven FM patients were enrolled with 2 weeks wash-out then randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups; pregabalin with CoQ10 or pregabalin with placebo for 40 d. Then, patients in CoQ10 group were switched to placebo, and patients in placebo group were switched to CoQ10 for another 40 d. Pain pressure threshold (PPT), FM questionnaire, anxiety, and pain score were examined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated to investigate mitochondrial oxidative stress and inflammation at day 0, 40, and 80. The level of antioxidants and brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan were also determined at these time points. Pregabalin alone reduced pain and anxiety via decreasing brain activity compared with their baseline. However, it did not affect mitochondrial oxidative stress and inflammation. Supplementation with CoQ10 effectively reduced greater pain, anxiety and brain activity, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and inflammation. CoQ10 also increased a reduced glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in FM patients. These findings provide new evidence that CoQ10 supplementation provides further benefit for relieving pain sensation in pregabalin-treated FM patients, possibly via improving mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation, and decreasing brain activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387429,N,no phys of interest,,,

The exact nature of the underlying fear learning and extinction deficits however, remains under debate. Using a three-day paradigm to separate the distinct learning and consolidation processes, we aimed to gain insights into the neurofunctional substrates of altered fear conditioning, extinction training and recall in PD. In contrast to studies employing one-session fear conditioning paradigms, a differential fear conditioning and delayed extinction task was conducted for the purpose of disentangling neural networks involved in fear acquisition, extinction training and recall of extinction memories. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), quality-controlled datasets from 10 patients with PD and 10 healthy controls were available from three consecutive days (day 1: acquisition; day 2: extinction training; day 3: extinction recall) with neutral faces serving as CSs and an aversive auditory stimulus (panic scream) as US. PD patients showed heightened fear circuitry (e.g. right amygdala and left insula) activation during early acquisition and prolonged activation in the right insula, left inferior frontal operculum and left inferior frontal gyrus during extinction recall compared to healthy controls. Stronger neural activation in structures conferring defensive reactivity during early acquisition and extinction recall may indicate the accelerated acquisition of conditioned responses, while extinction recall may be attenuated as a function of PD pathophysiology. Future studies should investigate the predictive value of experimental measures of extinction recall for clinical relapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30497840,N,clinical,,,

We employed ultrahigh field (7T) fMRI and evaluated the influence of respiratory phase for optimal targeting, applying our respiratory-gated auricular vagal afferent nerve stimulation (RAVANS) technique. HYPOTHESIS: We proposed that targeting of nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and cardiovagal modulation in response to taVNS stimuli would be enhanced when stimulation is delivered during a more receptive state, i.e. exhalation. METHODS: Brainstem fMRI response to auricular taVNS (cymba conchae) was assessed for stimulation delivered during exhalation (eRAVANS) or inhalation (iRAVANS), while exhalation-gated stimulation over the greater auricular nerve (GANctrl, i.e. earlobe) was included as control. Furthermore, we evaluated cardiovagal response to stimulation by calculating instantaneous HF-HRV from cardiac data recorded during fMRI. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that eRAVANS evoked fMRI signal increase in ipsilateral pontomedullary junction in a cluster including purported NTS. Brainstem response to GANctrl localized a partially-overlapping cluster, more ventrolateral, consistent with spinal trigeminal nucleus. A region-of-interest analysis also found eRAVANS activation in monoaminergic source nuclei including locus coeruleus (LC, noradrenergic) and both dorsal and median raphe (serotonergic) nuclei. Response to eRAVANS was significantly greater than iRAVANS for all nuclei, and greater than GANctrl in LC and raphe nuclei. Furthermore, eRAVANS, but not iRAVANS, enhanced cardiovagal modulation, confirming enhanced eRAVANS response on both central and peripheral neurophysiological levels. CONCLUSION: 7T fMRI localized brainstem response to taVNS, linked such response with autonomic outflow, and demonstrated that taVNS applied during exhalation enhanced NTS targeting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30803865,Y,corr,uns,,

Identification of brain mechanisms underlying this may aid in the discovery of possible treatments. Acute psychological stress may induce arteriolar vasoconstriction and reduce blood flow to vital organs. We hypothesized that functional changes in brain regions involved with memory and autonomic/emotional regulation are implicated in the vasoconstrictive stress response, including the medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate), insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Subjects with a history of coronary artery disease (N = 59) underwent measurement of microvascular vasomotor tone with the EndoPAT device and O-15 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain during exposure to mental stress and control conditions. The peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) ratio was calculated as the mean peripheral vasomotor tone during stress divided by the mean tone during rest. Whole brain contrasts were performed between groups above and below the median PAT ratio, and significant contrasts were defined with cutoff p < 0.005. Stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction (below median PAT ratio) was associated with increased stress activation in insula and parietal cortex, and decreased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex with stress tasks compared to control tasks. These findings demonstrate that stress-induced vasoreactivity is associated with changes in brain responses to stress in areas involved in emotion and autonomic regulation.

Epub 2019 Oct 22.","Peripheral neuropathies are a group of disorders that affect the peripheral nervous system, for which hundreds of etiologies have been identified. This article presents a stepwise approach to the evaluation and workup of peripheral neuropathy, which starts with a detailed history of symptoms, family and occupational history, and a neurological as well as general physical exam. Pattern recognition of various neuropathies can help to build a differential diagnosis based on the presentation. Such patterns include acute versus chronic, primary demyelinating versus axonal, hereditary versus acquired, asymmetric versus symmetric, presence of facial palsies, sensory or motor predominant, and presence of prominent autonomic symptoms. Early categorization of the type of neuropathy can help focus the workup for peripheral neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (NCS/EMG) is the primary diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with large-fiber polyneuropathy. One of the most important roles of NCS/EMG is to help categorize polyneuropathy as primary axonal versus primary demyelinating. The finding of a primary demyelinating polyneuropathy narrows the differential diagnosis of polyneuropathy dramatically and increases the chances of finding a treatable etiology. Laboratory workup includes serum studies and potentially cerebrospinal fluid, genetic studies, immunological markers, and fat pad biopsy for select patients. Skin biopsy may be used to assess intraepidermal nerve fiber density if small-fiber neuropathy is suspected, and nerve biopsy may be useful in select cases. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging and neuromuscular ultrasound have also shown promise in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathy. Identification of the etiology of neuropathy is crucial and often time-sensitive, as an increasing number of causes are now reversible or treatable.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639835,N,no brain data,,,

However, its variability with respect to gender and age, particularly in the resting state, remains poorly understood.

Results revealed that each of the seeded connectivity maps engaged in at least one of the large-scale brain networks including sensorimotor, attentional, basal ganglia, limbic, and default mode networks (DMN). In the early-adulthood stage, females had stronger negative rsFC in pMCC and right anterior INS (aINS) with the medial DMN than males, possibly reflecting their greater suppression of the sympathoexcitation associated with sex hormonal estrogen. Whereas in the late-adulthood stage, they showed stronger positive rsFC in pMCC with postcentral gyrus and weaker negative rsFC with the most DMN, possibly relating to their higher risk of depression, anxiety, and dementia than males after menopause. Moreover, females demonstrated reduced negative rsFC in pMCC with dorsal PCUN/PCC and left AG with advancing age, whereas males showed the opposite pattern, namely increased positive rsFC, in pMCC with right SMG, and in vmPFC with ventral PCUN. We interpret these results as their differences of altered autonomic regulation associated with pain experience and reflective movement, respectively, due to aging.

Furthermore, better control of parameters that may have an influence on the fMRI signal and that can easily be controlled for, like blood pressure, heart rate, diet, time of day, might improve reliability substantially.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31969840,N,methods paper,,,

However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS-E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS-N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS-) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29373635,N,no phys of interest,,,

Therapeutic pressure activates effective resistance mechanisms and we characterized these mechanisms in response to the currently used neoadjuvant treatment against EAC: carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiotherapy. We developed an in vitro approximation of this regimen and applied it to primary patient-derived cultures. We observed a heterogeneous epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) response to the high therapeutic pressure exerted by chemoradiation. We found EMT to be initiated by the autocrine production and response to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) of EAC cells. Inhibition of TGF-beta ligands effectively abolished chemoradiation-induced EMT. Assessment of TGF-beta serum levels in EAC patients revealed that high levels after neoadjuvant treatment predicted the presence of fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes on the post-chemoradiation positron emission tomography-scan. Our study shows that chemoradiation contributes to resistant metastatic disease in EAC patients by inducing EMT via autocrine TGF-beta production. Monitoring TGF-beta serum levels during treatment could identify those patients at risk of developing metastatic disease, and who would likely benefit from TGF-beta targeting therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018252,N,no corr,,,

Few studies have examined configural learning where subjects form a representation of the threat-related context as a gestalt whole from the individual features in the environment. The goal of the current study was to compare and contrast neural circuitry recruited by variation in demands placed on configural threat encoding. Subjects (N=25) completed a configural threat learning task, where we manipulated the amount of configural encoding required to learn the threat association (low demand: changes to a discrete element of the context; and high demand: rearrangement of elements). US expectancy ratings, skin conductance responses (SCR), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were collected. Subjects successfully learned the configural threat association as measured by US expectancy ratings, SCR, and BOLD activity. Hippocampal and amygdala region of interest analyses indicated differential configural threat learning and predicted SCR measures of learning. Furthermore, whole brain analyses identified four circuits that were impacted by the amount of differential configural encoding required, but none correlated with SCR. These results set the stage for a more detailed understanding of how configural threat learning is instantiated in the brain-an important mechanism associated with PTSD and other fear-related disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173725,N,mvpa,,,

Here, we provide a population-based reference material of total and regional lean body mass, muscle strength/power parameters, and physical function in a healthy cohort of Danish men and women across the lifespan. METHODS: Volunteers aged 20-93 years from the Copenhagen City Heart Study were invited to establish a Danish reference material (Copenhagen Sarcopenia Study) on lean mass characteristics [appendicular lean mass (ALM), iDXA, GE Lunar], muscle function [handgrip strength (HGS), Jamar dynamometer and leg extension power (LEP), Nottingham Power Rig], and physical function [30 s sit-to-stand test (STS), 10-m maximal and habitual gait speed (GS)]. RESULTS: A total of 1305 participants [729 women (age: 56.4 +/- 18.9 years, height: 1.66 +/- 0.01 m, body mass index: 24.6 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2) and 576 men, age: 57.0 +/- 17.5 years, height: 1.80 +/- 0.07 m, body mass index: 26.0 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2) ] completed all measurements and were included in the present analysis. Lean mass characteristics (TLM, ALM, and ALM/h(2) ) decreased with increasing age in both men and women (P < 0.001). Men demonstrated larger absolute and relative total ALM and higher HGS and LEP compared with women at all age intervals (P < 0.001). HGS and LEP decreased progressively with age in both men and women (P < 0.01); 30 s STS performance, habitual GS, and maximal GS decreased at an accellerated rate of decline with increasing age in both men and women (P < 0.001). Habitual GS was reduced in men and women aged >/=70 years, while maximal GS was reduced from the age of >/=60 years compared with young adults (P < 0.001). Regardless of sex, 30 s STS was reduced from the age of >/=50 years compared with the young reference group (P < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: While the power-based measurements (LEP and 30 s STS) started to decline already at age +50 years, less power-based parameters (GS and HGS) and lean mass characteristics (TLM, ALM, and ALM/h(2) ) remained unaltered until after the age of +70 years.

When participants dictated the pace of their own responses, activation and network connectivity within the dorsal attention network (DAN) increased over short time scales (~2-3min), a phenomenon that was not observed when participants had no control over their pace of work. Reaction time slowing was also the most pronounced in this self-paced task. In contrast, TOT-related changes in default-mode network (DMN) activity and connectivity, DAN-DMN anti-correlations, and pupil diameter did not differ based on pacing or task instructions. Over a longer (~10min) time scale, task-positive activation and connectivity decreased in all paradigms, in agreement with older findings.

Here, we took up this challenge in an attempt to distinguish between two competing accounts of the problem size effect (PSE), a robust finding in investigations of mathematical cognition. The PSE occurs when people solve arithmetic problems and indicates that numerically large problems are solved more slowly and erroneously than small problems. Neurocognitive explanations for the PSE can be categorized into representation-based and process-based views. Behavioral and traditional univariate neural measures have struggled to distinguish between these accounts. By contrast, a representational similarity analysis (RSA) approach with fMRI data provides competing hypotheses that can distinguish between accounts without recourse to reverse inference. To that end, our RSA (but not univariate) results provided clear evidence in favor of the representation-based over the process-based account of the PSE in multiplication; for addition, the results were less clear. Post-hoc similarity analysis distinguished still further between competing representation-based theoretical accounts. Namely, data favored the notion that individual multiplication problems are stored as individual memory traces sensitive to input frequency over a strictly magnitude-based account of memory encoding. Together, these results provide an example of how human neuroimaging evidence can directly inform cognitive-level explanations of a common behavioral phenomenon, the problem size effect. More broadly, these data may expand our understanding of calculation and memory systems in general.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201841,N,no phys of interest,,,

Social interactions are no longer bound to real-life encounters, but more often happen from behind a screen. Mimicking an online communication platform, we developed a new, fMRI compatible, social threat paradigm to investigate sex differences in reactions to social rejection. During the Verbal Interaction Social Threat Task (VISTTA), participants initiate 30 short conversations by selecting one of four predefined opening sentences. Two computerized interlocutors respond to the opening sentence mostly with negative comments and rejections toward the participant, which should induce social-evaluative threat. Physiological and subjective responses were measured, before, during, and after the VISTTA in 61 (29 male and 32 female) first year students who received either mostly negative (n = 31; threat group) or neutral comments (n = 30; control group). Two-level behavioral validation included social threat-induced mood changes in participants, and interlocutor evaluation. The latter consisted of multiple variables such as ""willingness to cooperate"" after every conversation, an overall fairness evaluation of interlocutors, and evaluations per reaction indicating how positive or negative it was received. We acquired additional physiological measures including cortisol assays via saliva samples, heart rate, and blood pressure. Confirming our hypotheses, peer rejection and exclusion during the VISTTA led to less willingness to cooperate and lower fairness evaluation of interlocutors. It also induced feelings of anger and surprise and lower happiness in the social-threat group. Women showed overall higher emotion ratings compared to men. Contrary to our a priori hypothesis, the VISTTA did not induce cortisol and heart rate increases. However, the stable cortisol response in women in the threat group does not follow the circadian decline and might reflect an endocrinological response. The decline in cortisol response in men in both the threat and control group could indicate faster habituation to the VISTTA. Taken together, these findings indicate effects of social-evaluative threat on a behavioral level, and more moderate effects on the emotional and physiological level. Sex differences in affective and cortisol responses may indicate that women are more susceptible for the social-evaluative threat than men. With a realistic implementation of verbal, interactive, and social components, the VISTTA is designed as an fMRI paradigm that can be applied to elucidate the neural representation of social-evaluative threat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440131,N,no brain data,,,

The presence of LA in PWA may jeopardize the interpretation of cognitive evaluations, leading to biased conclusions about the severity of the language alteration and the effectiveness of the treatments. In the present study, we report the case of a woman (Mrs. A) with severe chronic mixed transcortical aphasia due to left frontal and parietal hemorrhages that partially spared the perisylvian area. Mrs. A was treated with the dopamine agonist Rotigotine alone and combined with Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT). Complementary evaluations included autonomic reactivity during the performance of different language tasks, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET). We found that formal language testing in a clinical setting triggered a dramatic increase of automatic echolalia, perseverations and frustration, making the task completion difficult. The treatment improved aphasia, but gains were more robust when evaluation was performed by Mrs. A's husband at home than by clinicians. Autonomic evaluation under Rotigotine revealed higher reactivity during tasks tapping an impaired function in comparison with a task evaluating a preserved function (verbal repetition). Baseline 18F-FDG-PET analysis showed decreased metabolic activity in left limbic-paralimbic areas, whereas rs-fMRI revealed compensatory activity in the right hemisphere. We also analyzed the different factors (e.g., premorbid personality traits, task difficulty) that may have contributed to LA in Mrs. A during language testing. Our findings emphasize the usefulness of implicating adequately trained laypersons in the evaluation and treatment of PWA showing LA.

However, generalization may also extend beyond the perceptual discrimination threshold, ostensibly due to contributions from processes other than perception. Currently the neural mechanisms that mediate perceptual and non-perceptual aspects of fear generalization are unclear. To investigate this question, we conducted a Pavlovian fear conditioning and generalization experiment, collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), skin conductance and explicit shock likelihood ratings, in 37 healthy subjects. Face stimuli were initially paired (CS+) or not paired (CS) with an electrical shock. During the generalization phase, responses were measured to the CS+, CS and a range of CS + -toCS morphs (generalization stimuli), selected for each participant based on that participant's discrimination ability. Across multiple measurements, we found that fear generalization responses were limited to stimuli that could not be distinguished from the CS + stimulus, thus following a gradient closely linked to perceptual discriminability. These measurements, which were correlated with one another, included skin conductance responses, behavioral ratings, and fMRI responses of anterior insula and superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, responses in areas of the default network, including the posterior cingulate gyrus, angular gyrus and hippocampus, showed a negative generalization function extending to stimuli that were more likely to be distinguished from the CS+. In addition, the generalization gradients of the anterior insula and the behavioral ratings showed some evidence for extension beyond perceptual limits.

If this physiology is explained it could be possible to extract clinically relevant information from the ICP curve. The venous outflow from the cranial cavity is pulsatile, and in theory the pulsatile component of venous outflow from the cranial cavity should be attenuated with increasing ICP. In this study, we explored the relationship between ICP and the pulsatility of the venous outflow from the intracranial cavity. METHODS: Thirty-seven neuro-intensive care patients that had been examined with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging regarding cerebral blood flow (CBF) through the internal carotid and vertebral arteries and venous flow in the internal jugular veins were retrospectively included. The pulsatility of the jugular flow was determined by calculating the venous pulsatile index. The results were correlated to clinical data registered in the patient data monitoring system, including ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). RESULTS: CBF was 996 +/- 298 ml/min, and the flow in the internal jugular veins equaled 67 +/- 17% of the CBF, with a range of 22-97%. The venous pulsatile index correlated negatively to ICP (R = - 0.47 p = 0.003). The lowest flow in the internal jugular veins over the cardiac cycle (Fmin) was not correlated to ICP. Temperature, end-tidal CO2, MAP, and CPP were not correlated to venous pulsatility. CONCLUSION: An increase in ICP correlates to a lower pulsatility of the venous outflow from the cranial cavity. A lower pulsatility could be due to increased pressure requirements to compress intracranial veins with increasing ICP.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240621,N,no phys of interest,,,

Both conditions have poorly understood pathophysiology. Several brain structures that play a role in pain and fatigue, such as the insular cortex and basal ganglia, are also implicated in autonomic function. OBJECTIVES: ANS dysfunction may point to common neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying the predominant symptoms for CFS and TMD. No studies to date have investigated the combination of both conditions. Thus, our aim was to test whether patients with CFS with or without TMD show differences in brain responses to autonomic challenges. METHODS: In this exploratory functional imaging study, patients with CFS who screened positive for TMD (n = 26), patients who screened negative for TMD (n = 16), and age-matched control participants (n = 10) performed the Valsalva maneuver while in a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. This maneuver is known to activate the ANS. RESULTS: For all 3 groups, whole-brain F test showed increased brain activation during the maneuver in the superior and inferior frontal gyri, the left and right putamen and thalamus, and the insular cortex. Furthermore, group contrasts with small-volume correction showed that patients with CFS who screened positive for TMD showed greater activity in the left insular cortex as compared with patients who screened negative and in the left caudate nucleus as compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that increased activity in the cortical and subcortical regions observed during autonomic challenges may be modulated by fatigue and pain. ANS dysfunction may be a contributing factor to these findings, and further work is required to tease apart the complex relationship among CFS, TMD, and autonomic functions. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Brain activity related to activation of the autonomic nervous system in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who screened positive for painful temporomandibular disorder was greater than in patients who screened negative; activity was seen in brain regions associated with autonomic functions and pain. These findings suggest that autonomic dysfunction may play a role in the pathophysiology of both conditions, explain some of the apparent comorbidity between them, and offer avenues to help with treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461628,N,no corr,,,

Little is known about the physiological correlates of the subjective experience of channeling. Methods: We conducted a prospective within-subject design study with 13 healthy adult trance channels. Participants alternated between 5-minute blocks of channeling and no-channeling three times while electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration were collected on two separate days. Voice recordings of the same story read in channeling and no-channeling states were also analyzed. Results: The pre-laboratory survey data about demographics, perception of the source, purpose and utility of channeled information reflected previous reports. Most participants were aware of their experience (rather than in a full trance) and had varying levels of perceived incorporation (i.e. control of their body). Voice analysis showed an increase in voice arousal and power (dB/Hz) differences in the 125 Hz bins between 0 and 625 Hz, and 3625 and 3875 Hz when reading during the channeling state versus control. Despite subjective perceptions of distinctly different states, no substantive differences were seen in EEG frequency power, ECG measures, GSR and respiration. Conclusions: Voice parameters were different between channeling and no-channeling states using rigorous controlled methods, but other physiology measure collected were not. Considering the subjective and phenomenological differences observed, future studies should include other measures such as EEG connectivity analyses, fMRI and biomarkers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815253,N,eeg,,,

Epub 2019 Jan 14.","BACKGROUND: There has been an increase in the number of psoriasis treatments being investigated in clinical trials. Patients may have undiagnosed issues at the start of a study which may become identified during follow-up as incident medicinal conditions. The prevalence of incidental findings in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis presenting for clinical trials is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of incidentalomas and rate of malignancy identified by fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in clinical trial patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. METHODS: A cross-sectional secondary analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who underwent FDG PET/CT scans at the baseline visit, before randomization, for 3 phase 4 clinical trials on vascular inflammation in psoriasis. Only patients without active infection, malignancy, or uncontrolled comorbidities were eligible for the clinical trials. RESULTS: A total of 259 healthy patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis underwent an FDG PET/CT scan as part of the study procedures. In all, 31 patients (11.97%) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.28-16.56) had clinically significant incidentalomas on the baseline FDG PET/CT scan. Univariate logistic regression demonstrated that with every increase of 10 years of age, there was an approximate 30% increased risk of discovery of an incidentaloma (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.68). Of those patients with findings suggestive of malignancy (n = 28), 6 were confirmed to have cancer, resulting in a 2.31% (95% CI, 0.9-5.0) prevalence of malignancy. The positive predictive value of a true cancer was 31.58% (range, 21%-54%). LIMITATIONS: Generalizability and lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Incidentalomas on FDG PET/CT imaging are common in otherwise healthy, asymptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in clinical trials. Our results can help inform interpretation of clinical trial safety data and emphasize the importance of compliance with cancer screening recommendations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654078,N,clinical,,,

Epub 2019 May 27.","BACKGROUND: An earlier study characterized the neural correlates of self-initiated actions in a Cyberball game in healthy individuals. It remains unclear how social anxiety may influence these neural processes. METHODS: We examined regional activations to self-initiated actions in 25 adults with low and 25 with high social anxiety (LA and HA, respectively). Skin conductance was recorded concurrently with fMRI. We followed published routines in the analyses of imaging and skin conductance data. RESULTS: We hypothesized that HA as compared to LA individuals would demonstrate increased cortical limbic activations during self-initiated actions (tossing or T > receiving or R trials, to control for motor activities) in social exclusion (EX) vs. fair game (FG) scenario. At a corrected threshold, HA as compared with LA group showed increases in bilateral posterior insula activation during T vs. R trials in EX as compared to FG. Further, HA as compared to LA showed higher skin conductance response to tossing trials during EX as compared to FG. LIMITATIONS: With a limited sample size, we did not examine potential sex effects. Further, we cannot rule out the effects of depression on the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Together, the results suggest that individuals with more severe social anxiety engaged the somatosensory insula to a greater extent and exhibited higher physiological arousal when initiating ball toss during social exclusion in the Cyberball game. Posterior insula response to self-initiated action may represent a biomarker of social anxiety. It remains to be investigated whether interventions to decrease physiological arousal may alleviate social anxiety.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31153052,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2019 Feb 7.","Preventing declines in cerebral blood flow is important for maintaining optimal brain health with aging. We compared the effects of a morning bout of moderate-intensity exercise, with and without subsequent light-intensity walking breaks from sitting, on cerebral blood velocity over 8 h in older adults. In a randomized crossover trial, overweight/obese older adults ( n = 12, 70 +/- 7 yr; 30.4 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2)), completed three acute conditions (6-day washout); SIT: prolonged sitting (8 h, control); EX+SIT: sitting (1 h), moderate-intensity walking (30 min), followed by uninterrupted sitting (6.5 h); and EX + BR: sitting (1 h), moderate-intensity walking (30 min), followed by sitting (6.5 h) interrupted with 3 min of light-intensity walking every 30 min. Bilateral middle cerebral artery velocities (MCAv) were determined using transcranial Doppler at 13 time points across the day. The temporal pattern and average MCAv over 8 h was determined. The pattern of MCAv over 8 h was a negative linear trend in SIT ( P < 0.001), but a positive quadratic trend in EX + SIT ( P < 0.001) and EX + BR ( P < 0.01). Afternoon time points in SIT were lower than baseline within condition ( P </= 0.001 for all). A morning dip in MCAv was observed in EX + SIT and EX + BR ( P < 0.05 relative to baseline), but afternoon time points were not significantly lower than baseline. The average MCAv over 8 h was higher in EX + SIT than SIT ( P = 0.007) or EX + BR ( P = 0.024). Uninterrupted sitting should be avoided, and moderate-intensity exercise should be encouraged for the daily maintenance of cerebral blood flow in older adults. The clinical implications of maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow include the delivery of vital oxygen and nutrients to the brain. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to measure the combined effects of an exercise bout with breaks in sitting on cerebral blood velocity in older adults. Using frequent recordings over an 8-h period, we have performed a novel analysis of the pattern of cerebral blood velocity, adjusting for concurrent measures of mean arterial pressure and other potential confounders in a linear mixed effects regression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30730813,N,no phys of interest,,,

Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin, but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n = 9; 5 male) completed two 20-min rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at approximately 0.1 Hz show a high degree of spatially structured correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition explain approximately 2.2% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance. Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used to collect 10-min rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group of healthy adults (n = 5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to estimate the R2 ( *) decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e., blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral autoregulation with high spatial resolution.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133780,N,methods paper,,,

However, it is unclear what precisely about social actions these areas represent: perceptual features that may be indicative of social actions - such as the presence of persons in a scene, their orientation toward each other, and in particular the directedness of action movements toward persons or other targets - or more abstract representations that capture whether an action is meant to be social. In two fMRI experiments, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to test whether LOTC is sensitive to perceptual action components important for social interpretation and/or more general representations of sociality (Experiment 1) and implied person-directedness (Experiment 2). We found that LOTC is sensitive to perceptual action components (person presence, person orientation, and action directedness toward different types of recipients). By contrast, more general levels of sociality and implied person-directedness were not captured by LOTC. Our findings suggest that regions in LOTC provide the perceptual basis for social action interpretation but challenge accounts that posit specialization at more general levels sensitive to social actions and sociality as such. We propose that the interpretation of an action - in terms of sociality or other intentional aspects - arises from the interaction of multiple areas in processing relevant action components in a situation-dependent manner.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491524,N,no phys of interest,,,

The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether low blood pressure at follow-up is associated with increased selective neuronal damage. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 76 medically treated patients with atherosclerotic internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery disease with no ischaemic episodes on a follow-up of 6 months or more. All patients had measurements of the distribution of central benzodiazepine receptors twice using positron emission tomography and (11)C-flumazenil. Using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections, we quantified abnormal decreases in the benzodiazepine receptors of the cerebral cortex within the middle cerebral artery distribution and correlated these changes in the benzodiazepine receptors index with blood pressure values at follow-up examinations. RESULTS: The changes in the benzodiazepine receptor index during follow-up (mean 27+/-21 months) were negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure at follow-up. The relationship between changes in benzodiazepine receptor index and systolic blood pressure was different among patients with and without decreased cerebral blood flow at baseline (interaction, p<0.005). Larger increases in benzodiazepine receptor index (neuronal damage) were observed at lower systolic blood pressure levels in patients with decreased cerebral blood flow than in patients without such decreases.

However, how actions influence memory formation remains poorly understood. Goal-directed movement engages the locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of noradrenaline in the brain. Noradrenaline is also known to enhance episodic encoding, suggesting that action could improve memory via LC engagement. Here we demonstrate, across seven experiments, that action (Go-response) enhances episodic encoding for stimuli unrelated to the action itself, compared to action inhibition (NoGo). Functional magnetic resonance imaging, and pupil diameter as a proxy measure for LC-noradrenaline transmission, indicate increased encoding-related LC activity during action. A final experiment, replicated in two independent samples, confirmed a novel prediction derived from these data that emotionally aversive stimuli, which recruit the noradrenergic system, modulate the mnemonic advantage conferred by Go-responses relative to neutral stimuli. We therefore provide converging evidence that action boosts episodic memory encoding via a noradrenergic mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388000,N,no corr,,,

The individual capacity to elicit such mental images is not universal but varies within and between subjects. Neuroimaging studies have shown that these inter-as well as intra-individual differences in imagery quality mediate the amplitude of neural activity during MI on a group level. However, these analyses were not sensitive to forms of representation that may not map onto a simple modulation of overall amplitude. Therefore, the present study asked how far the subjective impression of motor imagery vividness is reflected by a spatial neural code, and how patterns of neural activation in different motor regions relate to specific imagery impressions. During fMRI scanning, 20 volunteers imagined three different types of right-hand actions. After each imagery trial, subjects were asked to evaluate the perceived vividness of their imagery. A correlation analysis compared the rating differences and neural dissimilarity values of the rating groups separately for each region of interest. Results showed a significant positive correlation in the left vPMC and right IPL, indicating that these regions particularly reflect perceived imagery vividness in that similar rated trials evoke more similar neural patterns. A decoding analysis revealed that the vividness of the motor image related systematically to the action specificity of neural activation patterns in left vPMC and right SPL. Imagined actions accompanied by higher vividness ratings were significantly more distinguishable within these areas. Altogether, results showed that spatial patterns of neural activity within the human motor cortices reflect the individual vividness of imagined actions.

However, it remains unknown which outcome measures can assess changes in emotion regulation and affective instability, associated with amygdala downregulation in a clinical trial. The current study directly addresses this question. Twenty-four female patients with a DSM-IV BPD diagnosis underwent four runs of amygdala neurofeedback. Before and after the training, as well as at a six-weeks follow-up assessment, participants completed measures of emotion dysregulation and affective instability at diverse levels of analysis (verbal report, clinical interview, ecological momentary assessment, emotion-modulated startle, heart rate variability, and fMRI). Participants were able to downregulate their amygdala blood oxygen-dependent (BOLD) response with neurofeedback. There was a decrease of BPD symptoms as assessed with the Zanarini rating scale for BPD (ZAN-BPD) and a decrease in emotion-modulated startle to negative pictures after training. Further explorative analyses suggest that patients indicated less affective instability, as seen by lower hour-to-hour variability in negative affect and inner tension in daily life.

Along with lower blood pressure, patients with hypertension receiving acupuncture also presented improvement in function of cognition, emotion, language, sematic sensation, and so on. This study was a primary study to explore the acting path of acupuncture at combined acupoints in stimulated brain areas related to such functions. Methods: In this research, regional homogeneity (ReHo) was applied to analyze the Rs-fMRI image data of brain activities after acupuncture at LR3, KI3, and LR3+KI3 and to compare the differences of functional brain activities between stimulating combined acupoints and single acupoint under pathological conditions. A total of thirty hypertension patients underwent Rs-fMRI scanning before acupuncture treatment and then were randomly divided into three groups following random number table, the LR3 group (3 males and 7 females), the KI3 group (3 males and 7 females), and the LR3+ KI3 group (4 males and 6 females) for needling, respectively. When the 30-min treatment finished, they received a further Rs-fMRI scanning. The Rs-fMRI data before and after the acupuncture treatment were analyzed through ReHo. Results: Compared with preacupuncture, respectively, ReHo values increased in Brodmann areas (BAs) 3, 18, and 40 and decreased in BAs 7 and 31 in LR3+ KI3 group. However, ReHo values only decreased in BA7 of KI3 group while the results showed no significant difference of brain regions in LR3 group between pre- and postacupuncture.

Against this background, the present randomized placebo-controlled pharmacologic functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment aimed at determining the extinction enhancing potential of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan (LT) in humans. METHODS: Seventy healthy male subjects underwent Pavlovian threat conditioning and received single-dose LT (50 mg) or placebo administration before extinction. Psychophysiological threat reactivity (skin conductance response) and neural activity during extinction served as primary outcomes. Psychophysiological interaction, voxelwise mediation, and novel multivariate pattern classification analyses were used to determine the underlying neural mechanisms. RESULTS: LT significantly accelerated the decline of the psychophysiological threat response during within-session extinction learning. On the neural level, the acceleration was accompanied and critically mediated by threat-specific enhancement of vmPFC activation. Furthermore, LT enhanced vmPFC-basolateral amygdala coupling and attenuated the neural threat expression, particularly in the vmPFC, during early extinction. CONCLUSIONS: Overall the results indicate that LT facilitates within-session threat memory extinction by augmenting threat-specific encoding in the vmPFC and its regulatory control over the amygdala. The findings document a pivotal role of angiotensin regulation of extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct LT administration has the potential to facilitate the efficacy of exposure-based interventions in anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471037,M,mediation,,,
Resting-State Functional Connectivity Between Centromedial Amygdala and Insula as Related to Somatic Symptoms in Depressed Patients: A Preliminary Study,Psychosom Med,"Zu, Meidan,Wang, Anzhen,Bai, Tongjian,Xie, Wen,Guan, Jianjun,Tian, Yanghua,Wang, Kai,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Psychosom Med. 2019 Jun;81(5):434-440. doi: 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000697.","OBJECTIVE: Somatic symptoms are prevalent in patients with depression. The centromedial amygdala (CMA) is a key brain region that mediates autonomic and somatic responses. Abnormal function in the CMA may contribute to the development of somatic symptoms in depressed patients. METHODS: We compared the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based on the seed of the left and right CMA between 37 patients with depression and 30 healthy controls. The severity of depressive and somatic symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the 15-item somatic symptom severity scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the RSFC and clinical variables (HDRS and PHQ-15) in depressed patients. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with depression exhibited decreased RSFC between the CMA and insula, and superior temporal gyrus. In addition, functional connectivity between the left CMA and left insula was negatively correlated with PHQ-15 (r = -0.348, p = .037) in depressed patients. No significant relation was found between the RSFC and HDRS in depressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Functional connectivity between the CMA and insula is reduced in depressive patients, which is associated with the severity of somatic symptoms. Our findings may provide a potential neural substrate to interpret the co-occurrence of depression with somatic symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008903,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 15.","BACKGROUND: While translational theories link neurodevelopmental changes in threat learning to pathological anxiety, findings from studies in patients inconsistently support these theories. This inconsistency may reflect difficulties in studying large patient samples with wide age ranges using consistent methods. A dearth of imaging data in patients further limits translational advances. We address these gaps through a psychophysiology and structural brain imaging study in a large sample of patients across the lifespan. METHODS: A total of 351 participants (8-50 years of age; 209 female subjects; 195 healthy participants and 156 medication-free, treatment-seeking patients with anxiety) completed a differential threat conditioning and extinction paradigm that has been validated in pediatric and adult populations. Skin conductance response indexed psychophysiological response to conditioned (CS+, CS-) and unconditioned threat stimuli. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were available for 250 participants. Analyses tested anxiety and age associations with psychophysiological response in addition to associations between psychophysiology and brain structure. RESULTS: Regardless of age, patients and healthy comparison subjects demonstrated comparable differential threat conditioning and extinction. The magnitude of skin conductance response to both conditioned stimulus types differentiated patients from comparison subjects and covaried with dorsal prefrontal cortical thickness; structure-response associations were moderated by anxiety and age in several regions. Unconditioned responding was unrelated to anxiety and brain structure. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than impaired threat learning, pathological anxiety involves heightened skin conductance response to potential but not immediately present threats; this anxiety-related potentiation of anticipatory responding also relates to variation in brain structure. These findings inform theoretical considerations by highlighting anticipatory response to potential threat in anxiety.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31955915,N,structural,,,

The present study evaluated the putative effect of hypobaria on CVR and its influence on cerebral oxygen delivery (cDO2 ) in five randomized conditions (i.e., normobaric normoxia, NN, altitude level of 440 m; hypobaric hypoxia, HH at altitude levels of 3,000 m and 5,500 m; normobaric hypoxia, NH, altitude simulation of 5,500 m; and hypobaric normoxia, HN). CVR was assessed in nine healthy participants (either students in aviation or pilots) during a hypercapnic test (i.e., 5% CO2 ). We obtained CVR by plotting middle cerebral artery velocity versus end-tidal CO2 pressure (PET CO2 ) using a sigmoid model. Hypobaria induced an increased slope in HH (0.66 +/- 0.33) compared to NH (0.35 +/- 0.19) with a trend in HN (0.46 +/- 0.12) compared to NN (0.23 +/- 0.12, p = .069). PET CO2 was decreased (22.3 +/- 2.4 vs. 34.5 +/- 2.8 mmHg and 19.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.2 mmHg, for HN vs. NN and HH vs. NH, respectively, p < .05) in hypobaric conditions when compared to normobaric conditions with comparable inspired oxygen pressure (141 +/- 1 vs. 133 +/- 3 mmHg and 74 +/- 1 vs. 70 +/- 2 mmHg, for NN vs. HN and NH vs. HH, respectively) During hypercapnia, cDO2 was decreased in 5,500 m HH (p = .046), but maintained in NH when compared to NN. To conclude, CVR seems more sensitive (i.e., slope increase) in hypobaric than in normobaric conditions. Moreover, hypobaria potentially affected vasodilation reserve (i.e., MCAv autoregulation) and brain oxygen delivery during hypercapnia. These results are relevant for populations (i.e., aviation pilots; high-altitude residents as miners; mountaineers) occasionally exposed to hypobaric normoxia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097541,N,no phys of interest,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 21.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Exercise plays an important role in supporting overall brain health. However, the mechanisms by which exercise supports brain health are imprecisely defined. Further, brain hemodynamic changes during exercise are not clearly understood, especially in older adults. The primary aim of this study was to compare cerebral blood flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) during moderate-intensity exercise between older adults with normal pulsatile flow (normal PI) and older adults with elevated pulsatile flow (elevated PI). Secondary aims were to compare cardiovascular disease risk and cognitive function between individuals with elevated and nonelevated PI. METHODS: Using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and PI were recorded during the rest and moderate-intensity exercise. End tidal carbon dioxide (PET CO2 ) and beat-to-beat mean arterial blood pressure were also recorded. RESULTS: We enrolled 104 older adults into the study. The change in PI was greater in normal PI group (35.5% vs. 21.3%, P = .005). The change in MCAv was similar in both groups (11.6% for normal PI vs. 10.6% for elevated PI; P = .22). There was no significant difference in cardiovascular disease risk between the two groups (P = .77). Individuals with elevated PI performed significantly worse in WAIS-R Digit Symbol and Trail Making Test A (P = .04 and = .01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The percent increase in PI from rest to moderate-intensity exercise was attenuated in the older adults with elevated resting PI.

Functional connectome analyses reveal the human olfactory network organization,eNeuro,"Arnold, T Campbell,You, Yuqi,Ding, Mingzhou,Zuo, Xi-Nian,de Araujo, Ivan,Li, Wen,eng,eNeuro. 2020 May 29. pii: ENEURO.0551-19.2020. doi: 10.1523/ENEURO.0551-19.2020.","The olfactory system is uniquely heterogeneous, performing multifaceted functions (beyond basic sensory processing) across diverse, widely distributed neural substrates. While knowledge of human olfaction continues to grow, it remains unclear how the olfactory network is organized to serve this unique set of functions. Leveraging a large and high-quality resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) dataset of nearly 900 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we identified a human olfactory network encompassing cortical and subcortical regions across the temporal and frontal lobes. Highlighting its reliability and generalizability, the connectivity matrix of this olfactory network mapped closely onto that extracted from an independent rs-fMRI dataset. Graph theoretical analysis further explicated the organizational principles of the network. The olfactory network exhibits a modular composition of three (i.e., the sensory, limbic, and frontal) subnetworks and demonstrates strong small-world properties, high in both global integration and local segregation (i.e., circuit specialization). This network organization thus ensures the segregation of local circuits, which are nonetheless integrated via connecting hubs (i.e., amygdala and anterior insula), thereby enabling the specialized, yet integrative, functions of olfaction. In particular, the degree of local segregation positively predicted olfactory discrimination performance in the independent sample, which we infer as a functional advantage of the network organization. In sum, an olfactory functional network has been identified through the large HCP dataset, affording a representative template of the human olfactory functional neuroanatomy. Importantly, the topological analysis of the olfactory network provides network-level insights into the remarkable functional specialization and spatial segregation of the olfactory system.Significance statement Olfaction is an intriguing multifunctional system, playing key roles in regulating emotions, autonomic tone, and feeding, beyond basic sensory perception. However, it is unclear how the neuroanatomy of olfaction is organized in humans to subserve these functions. Functional connectivity analysis of the HCP dataset combined with graph theoretical analysis revealed an optimized large-scale network consisting of three subnetworks-the sensory, limbic, and frontal subnetworks. Distributed across frontal and temporal lobes in well segregated fashion, these olfactory structures are also highly integrated, linked through hub nodes of the amygdala and anterior insula. Our independent dataset replicated the HCP-derived olfactory network and, importantly, highlighted a direct association between the degree of network segregation and olfactory perception.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471848,N,no phys of interest,,,

The challenge of accessing intracranial pulsatility noninvasively is one reason few studies provide empirical insight on the relationship between large artery and tissue pulsatility in the human brain. PURPOSE: To investigate the association between the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-derived cardiac-related pulsatility in the insular cortex and the ultrasound-derived pulsatility index in the middle cerebral artery (MCA-PI). STUDY TYPE: Cross-sectional. POPULATION: Younger adults (11; 25 +/- 4 years) and older adults with and without cardiovascular risk factors (44; 70 +/- 6 years). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: T1 -weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and T2 *-weighted blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) sequences at 3T. ASSESSMENT: MCA-PI and cardiac-related pulsatility were assessed at rest by transcranial Doppler ultrasound and BOLD fMRI, respectively. STATISTICAL TESTS: Multivariate analyses of covariance between MCA-PI and cardiac-related pulsatility. Analysis of variance was used to assess regional differences. RESULTS: MCA-PI was associated with cardiac-related insular pulsatility (P = 0.037), but not whole-brain pulsatility (P = 0.81). Left insular pulsatility was higher than right insular pulsatility (P < 0.01) and was associated with diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.028). DATA CONCLUSION: We show a correlation between ultrasound and fMRI measures of cerebrovascular pulsatility. This association provides insight into the transmission of pulsatile energy from large basal arteries at the Circle of Willis to downstream cerebrovascular beds and has implications for the utility of cardiac-related pulsatility as a potential marker for cerebral small vessel disease.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging, electrophysiologic endpoints, and behavioral paradigms were used to assess working memory, executive function, and motivation/reward processing following multiple-dose administration of PF-06412562. A total of 77 patients were assigned PF-06412562 (3 mg twice daily and 15 mg twice daily) or placebo administered for 5 to 7 days. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, it was neither powered for any specific treatment effect nor corrected for multiple comparisons.

The present research sought to dissociate neural contributions of these memory processes by inducing episodic or semantic retrieval orientations prior to performance on a divergent thinking task during fMRI. We conducted a representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify multivoxel patterns of neural activity that were similar across induction (episodic and semantic) and idea generation. At the behavioral level, we found that semantic induction was associated with increased idea originality, assessed via computational estimates of semantic distance between concepts. RSA revealed that multivoxel patterns during semantic induction and subsequent idea generation were more similar (compared to episodic induction) within the left angular gyrus (AG), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and left anterior inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Conversely, activity patterns during episodic induction and subsequent generation were more similar within left parahippocampal gyrus and right anterior IPL. Together, the findings point to dissociable contributions of episodic and semantic memory processes to creative cognition and suggest that distinct regions within the default network support specific memory-related processes during divergent thinking.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31887423,N,no phys of interest,,,

In two experiments, we investigated whether dogs would rescue their owners when the person was trapped inside a wooden box and emitted clear signs of stress. The performance of these dogs was compared against that of a control group in which the owners remained calm while trapped. In addition, to assess if training modulated this behavior, we tested a group of dogs from the military trained in search and rescue tasks (Experiment 1). Results showed that dogs opened the box more frequently when the owner pretended to be stressed than when calm. Training shortened latencies to open the door but not the frequency of the behavior. In Experiment 2, we investigated if emotional contagion could be a possible mechanism underlying dogs' rescue responses by measuring dogs' behavior, heart rate, and saliva cortisol level in the stressed and calm conditions, and also controlled for obedience by having the calm owners call their pets while trapped. We replicated the findings of Experiment 1 as more dogs opened the door in the stressed owner condition than in the calm condition. In addition, we observed an increase in heart rate across trials in the stressed condition and a decrease across trials in the calm condition, but no differences in cortisol levels or stress-related behaviors between conditions. In brief, we found evidence that approximately half of the dogs without previous training showed spontaneous rescue behaviors directed to their owners. Neither was this behavior motivated by obedience nor by the motivation to re-establish social contact with the owner.

Biomarker studies in iRBD are relevant due to lack of evidence in this condition. The identification of biomarkers able to predict progression to synucleinopathy diseases is critical for iRBD. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging might provide information about ongoing neurodegenerative processes. In the present study, we tested for presence of brain hypometabolism patterns as biomarkers of neurodegeneration in single iRBD individuals. METHODS: We recruited 37 subjects with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD, with neuropsychological assessment and available FDG-PET scan. Images were analysed with a validated statistical parametric mapping procedure, providing individual hypometabolism maps. RESULTS: According to the neuropsychological evaluation, 22 subjects with iRBD had normal cognition and 15 subjects showed impairments, particularly in visuoperceptive/visuospatial and memory domains. One-fifth of the cases were impaired on the Qualitative Scoring of Pentagon Test. In 32 iRBD cases, FDG-PET statistical parametric maps revealed significant cerebral hypometabolism, namely in the occipital lobes (n = 5), occipital and cerebellar regions (n = 13), occipitoparietal regions (n = 13) and a selective cerebellar hypometabolism (n = 1). Five cases had normal FDG-PET scans. CONCLUSIONS: These imaging findings indicate that brain neurodegenerative processes are present and already detectable in iRBD.

However, increasing evidence show that mild hypoxia and mild hypercapnia in breath hold (BH) could work synergistically to enhance CBF response. We hypothesized that breath-by-breath O2-CO2 exchange ratio (bER), defined as the ratio of the change in partial pressure of oxygen (DeltaPO2) to that of carbon dioxide (DeltaPCO2) between end inspiration and end expiration, would be able to better correlate with the global and regional cerebral hemodynamic responses (CHR) to BH challenge. We aimed to investigate whether bER is a more useful index than end-tidal PCO2 to characterize cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) under BH challenge. METHODS: We used transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to evaluate CHR under BH challenge by measuring cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral arteries. Regional changes in CHR to BH and exogenous CO2 challenges were mapped with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We correlated respiratory gas exchange (RGE) metrics (bER, DeltaPO2, DeltaPCO2, end-tidal PCO2 and PO2, and time of breaths) with CHR (CBFv and BOLD) to BH challenge. Temporal features and frequency characteristics of RGE metrics and their coherence with CHR were examined. RESULTS: CHR to brief BH epochs and free breathing were coupled with both DeltaPO2 and DeltaPCO2. We found that bER was superior to either DeltaPO2 or DeltaPCO2 alone in coupling with the changes of CBFv and BOLD signals under breath hold challenge. The regional CVR results derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on bER under BH challenge resembled those derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on end-tidal PCO2 under exogenous CO2 challenge.

Further, we show that such physiologically-relevant connectivity estimates appear to dominate the overall connectivity observations in multiple HCP subjects, and that this apparent ""physiological connectivity"" cannot be removed by the use of a single nuisance regressor for the entire brain (such as global signal regression) due to the clear regional heterogeneity of the physiologically-coupled responses. Our results challenge previous notions that physiological confounds are either localized to large veins or globally coherent across the cortex, therefore emphasizing the necessity to consider potential physiological contributions in fMRI-based functional connectivity studies.

Intersubject representational similarity analysis reveals individual variations in affective experience when watching erotic movies,Neuroimage,"Chen, Pin-Hao A,Jolly, Eshin,Cheong, Jin Hyun,Chang, Luke J,eng,Neuroimage. 2020 Apr 12;216:116851. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116851.","We spend much of our lives pursuing or avoiding affective experiences. However, surprisingly little is known about how these experiences are represented in the brain and if they are shared across individuals. Here, we explored variations in the construction of an affective experience during a naturalistic viewing paradigm based on subjective preferences in sociosexual desire and self-control using intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA). We found that when watching erotic movies, intersubject variations in sociosexual desire preferences of 26 heterosexual males were associated with similarly structured fluctuations in the cortico-striatal reward, default mode, and mentalizing networks. In contrast, variations in the self-control preferences were associated with shared dynamics in the fronto-parietal executive control and cingulo-insular salience networks. Importantly, these results were specific to the affective experience, as we did not observe any relationship with variation in preferences when individuals watched neutral movies. Moreover, these results appear to require multivariate representations of preferences as we did not observe any significant associations using single scalar summary scores. Our findings indicate that multidimensional variations in individual preferences can be used to uncover unique dimensions of an affective experience, and that IS-RSA can provide new insights into the neural processes underlying psychological experiences elicited through naturalistic experimental designs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294538,N,no phys of interest,,,
Dynamic activity patterns in the anterior temporal lobe represents object semantics,Cogn Neurosci,"Clarke, Alex,eng,England,Cogn Neurosci. 2020 Apr 6:1-11. doi: 10.1080/17588928.2020.1742678.","The anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is considered a crucial area for the representation of transmodal concepts. Recent evidence suggests that specific regions within the ATL support the representation of individual object concepts, as shown by studies combining multivariate analysis methods and explicit measures of semantic knowledge. This research looks to further our understanding by probing conceptual representations at a spatially and temporally resolved neural scale. Representational similarity analysis was applied to human intracranial recordings from anatomically defined lateral to medial ATL sub-regions. Neural similarity patterns were tested against semantic similarity measures, where semantic similarity was defined by a hybrid corpus-based and feature-based approach. Analyses show that the perirhinal cortex, in the medial ATL, significantly related to semantic effects around 200 to 400 ms, and were greater than more lateral ATL regions. Further, semantic effects were present in low frequency (theta and alpha) oscillatory phase signals. These results provide converging support that more medial regions of the ATL support the representation of basic-level visual object concepts within the first 400 ms, and provide a bridge between prior fMRI and MEG work by offering detailed evidence for the presence of conceptual representations within the ATL.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32249714,N,no phys of interest,,,
The role of hippocampal spatial representations in contextualization and generalization of fear,Neuroimage,"de Voogd, Lycia D,Murray, Yannick P J,Barte, Ramona M,van der Heide, Anouk,Fernandez, Guillen,Doeller, Christian F,Hermans, Erno J,eng,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Neuroimage. 2020 Feb 1;206:116308. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116308. Epub 2019 Oct 25.","Using contextual information to predict aversive events is a critical ability that protects from generalizing fear responses to safe contexts. Animal models have demonstrated the importance of spatial context representations within the hippocampal formation in contextualization of fear learning. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to play an important role in safety learning, possibly also through the incorporation of context information. However, if contextual representations are related to context-dependent expression of fear memory in humans remains unclear. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent functional MRI combined with a cue-context conditioning paradigm within a self-navigated virtual reality environment. The environment included two buildings (Threat and Safe context), which had distinct features outside but were identical inside. Within each context, participants saw two cues (CS+, CS-). The CS+ was consistently (100% reinforcement rate) paired with an electric shock in the Threat context, but never in the Safe context. The CS- was never paired with a shock. We found robust differential skin conductance responses (SCRs; CS+ > CS-) in the Threat context, but also within the Safe context, indicating fear generalization. Within the Safe context, vmPFC responses to the CS+ were larger than those in the Threat context. We furthermore found environment-specific representations for the two contexts in the training paradigm (i.e., before conditioning took place) in the hippocampus to be related to fear expression and generalization. Namely, participants with a weak context representation (z-score<1.65) showed stronger fear generalization compared to participants with a strong context representation (z-score>1.65). Thus, a weak neural representation strength of spatial context may explain overgeneralization of memory to safe contexts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that context-dependent regulation of fear expression engages ventromedial prefrontal pathways suggesting this involves a similar mechanism that is known to be involved in retrieval of extinction memory.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669410,N,no corr,,,

Here, we investigated whether blunted sensitivity to bodily signals is associated with suicidal action by comparing individuals with a history of attempted suicide to a matched psychiatric reference sample without suicide attempts. We examined interoceptive processing across a panel of tasks: breath-hold challenge, cold-pressor challenge, and heartbeat perception during and outside of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Suicide attempters tolerated the breath-hold and cold-pressor challenges for significantly longer and displayed lower heartbeat perception accuracy than non-attempters. These differences were mirrored by reduced activation of the mid/posterior insula during attention to heartbeat sensations. Our findings suggest that suicide attempters exhibit an 'interoceptive numbing' characterized by increased tolerance for aversive sensations and decreased awareness of non-aversive sensations. We conclude that blunted interoception may be implicated in suicidal behavior.,The human brain closely monitors body signals essential for our survival, including our heartbeat, our breathing and even the temperature of our skin. This mostly unconscious process is called interoception. It helps people perceive potential or actual threats and helps them to respond appropriately. For example, a person charged by a wild animal will act instinctively to run, fight or freeze. Unlike most creatures, humans show an ability to counteract these survival instincts, and are capable of intentionally engaging in behaviors that result in physical harm. Recent increases in the rate of suicide have made it more urgent to try to understand what leads to this behavior in humans. Now, DeVille et al. show that people with psychiatric disorders who have survived a suicide attempt have blunted interoception. In four experiments, people with a history of suicide attempts were compared to another group of individuals without a history of suicide attempts. The groups were carefully matched such that there were no significant differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups, including in terms of their age, sex, body mass index and psychiatric symptoms. Both groups completed uncomfortable tasks like holding their breath or keeping their hand in icy cold water. The participants also completed two tasks that required them to focus on their own heartbeat, one of which was paired with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Those with a history of suicide attempts held their breath and kept their hand in cold water for longer, and also were less in tune with their heart rate. This ""interoceptive numbing"" was associated with less activity in part of the brain called the insular cortex. These differences could not be explained by the individuals having a psychiatric disorder or a history of considering suicide, or by them taking psychiatric medications. Instead, the interoceptive numbing was most often seen in individuals who made an attempt on their own life. The experiments identify physical characteristics that may differentiate people who attempt suicide from those who do not. This lays the groundwork for future research aimed at identifying biological indicators of suicide risk. More studies are needed to verify the results. If the results are verified, the next step would be prospective studies to determine whether measuring interoception can help clinicians predict who is at risk of a suicide attempt. If it does, it might give clinicians a new tool to try to prevent suicide by ensuring those at greatest risk receive appropriate care.,eng",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32254020,N,clinical,,,

Epub 2019 Dec 8.","AIMS: This study investigated the safety and efficacy of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) on ameliorating the sequelae of ischemic moyamoya disease (iMMD). METHODS: A total of 30 iMMD patients underwent long-term RIC and were followed up at 0.5, 1, and 2 years for clinical outcomes, including frequency of stroke recurrence, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, peak systolic velocities (PSV), and cerebral perfusion. RESULTS: During the whole RIC treatment process, no RIC-related adverse event occurred. Only one of 30 patients suffered a onetime infarction (3.3%), and the ratios of acceptable PGIC were 88.2%, 64.3%, and 92.3% at 0.5, 1, and 2 years follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the frequency of stroke recurrence was significantly reduced after RIC (P = .013). The frequency of TIA per week was 1.1 (0.6, 2.8) prior to RIC and 0.1 (0.0, 0.5) post-RIC (P < .01). Compared to baseline, PSV values were significantly reduced after RIC treatment (P = .002 at 0.5, P = .331 at 1, and P = .006 at 2 years). In patients undergoing perfusion studies, 75% obtained improvement on followed-up SPECT and 95% on followed-up PET maps.

The loud acoustic noise not only affects the activation of the auditory cortex, but may also interfere with resting state and task fMRI experiments. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, quiet, T2 *, whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)-fMRI method, termed Looping Star, compared to conventional multislice gradient-echo EPI. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. PHANTOM/SUBJECTS: Glover stability QA phantom; 10 healthy volunteers. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T: gradient echo (GE)-EPI and T2 * Looping Star fMRI. ASSESSMENT: Looping Star fMRI was presented and compared to GE-EPI with a working memory (WM) task and resting state (RS) experiments. Temporal stability and acoustic measurements were obtained for both methods. Functional maps and activation accuracy were compared to evaluate the performance of the novel sequence. STATISTICAL TESTS: Mean and standard deviation values were analyzed for temporal stability and acoustic noise tests. Activation maps were assessed with one-sample t-tests and contrast estimates (CE). Paired t-tests and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) were used to compare fMRI sensitivity and performance. RESULTS: Looping Star presented a 98% reduction in sound pressure compared with GE-EPI, with stable temporal stability (0.09% percent fluctuation), but reduced temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) (mean difference = 15.9%). The novel method yielded consistent activations for RS and WM (83.4% and 69.5% relative BOLD sensitivity), which increased with task difficulty (mean CE 2-back = 0.56 vs. 0-back = 0.08, P < 0.05). A few differences in spatial activations were found between sequences, leading to a 4-8% lower activation accuracy with Looping Star. DATA CONCLUSION: Looping Star provides a suitable approach for whole-brain coverage with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution and BOLD sensitivity, with only 0.5 dB above ambient noise. From the comparison with GE-EPI, further developments of Looping Star fMRI should target increased sensitivity and spatial specificity for both RS and task experiments. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship in humans remain less clear. Functional connectivity (FC), measured by task-free functional MRI (tf-fMRI) is a dynamic marker of network activity and may be a sensitive indicator of the brain's response to exercise over time. We aimed to test the longitudinal relationship between physical activity and FC trajectories in functionally normal older adults. Methods: Two hundred and twelve functionally normal, longitudinally-followed older adults completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and tf-fMRI scans at each visit [mean = 1.5 visits (range:1-3)]. We studied FC of the default mode network (DMN), frontal-parietal (FP), subcortical networks (SubCort), and frontal-subcortical inter-network connectivity (FS), given that previous studies implicate these regions in age-related changes. Linear mixed-effects models examined the relationship between within-person changes in PASE and FC (in SD units), covarying for age, sex, education and systemic cardiovascular risk factors (heart rate, BMI and systolic blood pressure). We additionally examined models covarying for DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of tracts underlying networks of interest, as a marker of cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, we examined the longitudinal relationship between PASE and neuropsychological trajectories. Results: In our first model, within-subject increases in physical activity tracked with increasing SubCort (beta = 0.33, p = 0.007) and FS inter-network (beta = 0.27, p = 0.03) synchrony, while between-subject parameters did not reach significance (beta = -0.042 to -0.07, ps > 0.37). No significant longitudinal associations were observed between PASE and DMN (beta = -0.02 p = 0.89) or FP networks (beta = 0.15, p = 0.23). Adjusting for markers of cerebrovascular health (FA/MD) did not change estimated effects (SubCort: beta = 0.31, p = 0.01, FS inter-network: beta = 0.28, p = 0.03). Associations between changes in physical activity and neuropsychological trajectories were small (beta = -0.14 to 0.002) and did not reach statistical significance (p-values >0.42). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that changes in exercise over time are specifically associated with frontal-subcortical processes in older adults. This relationship appears to be independent of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, possibly driven by a more direct neural response to exercise.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410981,N,FC study,,,

OBJECTIVES/METHODS: Using a specially designed functional MRI (fMRI) cycling ergometer, we have determined the sequence in which the cortical and subcortical brain regions are modulated at low and high ratings perceived exertion (RPE) during an incremental exercise protocol. RESULTS: Additional to the activation of the classical motor control regions (motor, somatosensory, premotor and supplementary motor cortices and cerebellum), we found the activation of the regions associated with autonomic regulation (ie, insular cortex) (ie, positive blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal) during exercise. Also, we showed reduced activation (negative BOLD signal) of cognitive-related areas (prefrontal cortex), an effect that increased during exercise at a higher perceived intensity (RPE 13-17 on Borg Scale). The motor cortex remained active throughout the exercise protocol whereas the cerebellum was activated only at low intensity (RPE 6-12), not at high intensity (RPE 13-17).

Further, sex differences in these comorbidities are substantial. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mood- and sex-dependent alterations in brain circuitry implicated in the regulation of the stress response are associated with reduced peripheral parasympathetic activity during negative emotional arousal. Fifty subjects (28 females) including healthy controls and individuals with major depression, bipolar psychosis and schizophrenia were evaluated. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and physiology (cardiac pulse) data were acquired during a mild visual stress reactivity challenge. Associations between changes in activity and functional connectivity of the stress response circuitry and variations in cardiovagal activity [normalized high frequency power of heart rate variability (HFn)] were evaluated using GLM analyses, including interactions with depressed mood and sex across disorders. Our results revealed that in women with high depressed mood, lower cardiovagal activity in response to negative affective stimuli was associated with greater activation of hypothalamus and right amygdala and reduced connectivity between hypothalamus and right orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. No significant associations were observed in women with low levels of depressed mood or men.

Epub 2020 Mar 14.","Skin conductance responses (SCRs) reliably occur in the absence of external stimulation. However, the neural correlates of these non-specific SCRs have been less explored than brain activity associated with stimulus-elicited SCRs. This study modeled spontaneous skin conductance responses observed during an unstructured resting state fMRI scan in 58 adolescents. A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) fMRI model was used to detect any type of hemodynamic response shape time-locked to non-specific SCRs; the shape of these responses was then carefully characterized. The strongest evidence for signal change was found in several sub-regions of sensorimotor cortex. There also was evidence for engagement of discrete areas within the lateral surfaces of the parietal lobe, cingulate cortex, fronto-insular operculum, and both visual and auditory primary processing areas. The hemodynamic profile measured by FIR modeling clearly resembled an event-related response. However, it was a complex response, best explained by two quickly successive, but opposing neuronal impulses across all brain regions - a brief positive response that begins several seconds prior to the SCR with a much longer negative neuronal impulse beginning shortly after the SCR onset. Post hoc exploratory analyses linked these two hemodynamic response phases to different emotion-related individual differences. In conclusion, this study shows the neural correlates of non-specific SCRs are a widespread, cortical network of brain regions engaged in a complex, seemingly biphasic fashion. This bimodal response profile should be considered in replication studies that attempt to directly link brain activity to possible homeostatic mechanisms or seek evidence for alternative mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184189,N,no coords,,,

Here we use a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of fMRI-BOLD signals to make quantitative comparisons across LGN and multiple visual areas of the low-level stimulus information encoded in the patterns of voxel responses. Our stimulus set was picked to target the four functionally distinct subcortical channels that input visual cortex from the LGN: two achromatic sinewave stimuli that favor the responses of the high-temporal magnocellular and high-spatial parvocellular pathways, respectively, and two chromatic stimuli isolating the L/M-cone opponent and S-cone opponent pathways, respectively. Each stimulus type had three spatial extents to sample both foveal and para-central visual field. With the RSA, we compare quantitatively the response specializations for individual stimuli and combinations of stimuli in each area and how these change across visual cortex. First, our results replicate the known response preferences for motion/flicker in the dorsal visual areas. In addition, we identify two distinct gradients along the ventral visual stream. In the early visual areas (V1-V3), the strongest differential representation is for the achromatic high spatial frequency stimuli, suitable for form vision, and a very weak differentiation of chromatic versus achromatic contrast. Emerging in ventral occipital areas (V4, VO1 and VO2), however, is an increasingly strong separation of the responses to chromatic versus achromatic contrast and a decline in the high spatial frequency representation.

No research to date, however, has simultaneously investigated whether altered vmPFC activation is associated with reduced HRV and elevated PTSD symptoms in the same individuals. Here, we collected fMRI data during alternating conditions of threat of shock and safety from shock in 51 male combat-exposed veterans with either high or low levels of PTSD symptoms. Pulse rate variability (PRV)-a HRV surrogate calculated from pulse oximetry-was assessed during a subsequent resting scan. Correlational analyses tested for hypothesized relationships between reduced vmPFC activation, lower PRV, and elevated PTSD symptomatology. We found that PTSD re-experiencing symptoms were inversely associated with high-frequency (HF)-PRV, thought to primarily reflect parasympathetic control of heart rate, in veterans with elevated PTSD symptoms. Reduced vmPFC activation for the contrast of safety-threat was associated both with lower HF-PRV and elevated PTSD re-experiencing symptoms.

In addition, they showed decreased frontal (vmPFC) activation and aberrant frontolimbic connectivity in response to a learned safety cue (CS-). Patients with low pain-related distress and healthy controls appeared strikingly similar across brain and behavior. These findings indicate that altered T-S discrimination, mediated by frontolimbic activation and connectivity, may be one mechanism maintaining pain chronicity in adolescents with high levels of pain-related distress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31764389,Y,corr,rand,,
Beta-adrenergic antagonism alters functional connectivity during associative processing in a preliminary study of individuals with and without autism,Autism,"Hegarty, John P 2nd,Zamzow, Rachel M,Ferguson, Bradley J,Christ, Shawn E,Porges, Eric C,Johnson, Jeffrey D,Beversdorf, David Q,eng,K01 AA025306/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/,England,Autism. 2020 Apr;24(3):795-801. doi: 10.1177/1362361319868633. Epub 2019 Aug 15.","Beta-adrenergic antagonism (e.g. propranolol) has been associated with cognitive/behavioral benefits following stress-induced impairments and for some cognitive/behavioral domains in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. In this preliminary investigation, we examined whether the benefits of propranolol are associated with functional properties in the brain. Adolescents/adults (mean age = 22.54 years) with (n = 13) and without autism spectrum disorder (n = 13) attended three sessions in which propranolol, nadolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier), or placebo was administered before a semantic fluency task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Autonomic nervous system measures and functional connectivity between language/associative processing regions and within the fronto-parietal control, dorsal attention, and default mode networks were examined. Propranolol was associated with improved semantic fluency performance, which was correlated with the baseline resting heart rate. Propranolol also altered network efficiency of regions associated with semantic processing and in an exploratory analysis reduced functional differences in the fronto-parietal control network in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Thus, the cognitive benefits from beta-adrenergic antagonism may be generally associated with improved information processing in the brain in domain-specific networks, but individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also benefit from additional improvements in domain-general networks. The benefits from propranolol may also be able to be predicted from baseline autonomic nervous system measures, which warrants further investigation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416333,N,clinical,,,

Whether changes in signal intensity can be detected in small brainstem regions during a cold pressor test (CPT) has not been explored thoroughly. The aim of this study was to measure whole brain and brainstem BOLD signal intensity changes in response to a modified CPT. Methods: BOLD fMRI was measured in healthy normotensive participants during a randomized crossover study (modified CPT vs. control test) using ultra-high field 7 Tesla MRI scanner. Data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) in a whole-brain approach, and with a brainstem-specific analysis using the spatially unbiased infra-tentorial template (SUIT) toolbox. Blood pressure (BP) and hormonal responses (norepinephrine and epinephrine levels) were also measured. Paired t-test statistics were used to compare conditions. Results: Eleven participants (six women, mean age 28 +/- 8.9 years) were analyzed. Mean arterial BP increased from 83 +/- 12 mm Hg to 87 +/- 12 mm Hg (p = 0.0009) during the CPT. Whole-brain analysis revealed significant activations linked to the CPT in the right supplementary motor cortex, midcingulate (bilateral) and the right anterior insular cortex. The brainstem-specific analysis showed significant activations in the dorsal medulla. Conclusion: Changes in BOLD fMRI signal intensity in brainstem regions during a CPT can be detected, and show an increased response during a cold stress in healthy volunteers. Consequently, BOLD fMRI at 7T is a promising tool to explore and acquire new insights in the comprehension of neurogenic hypertension.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32082112,N,no corr,,,
Facilitating translational science in anxiety disorders by adjusting extinction training in the laboratory to exposure-based therapy procedures,Transl Psychiatry,"Hollandt, Maike,Wroblewski, Adrian,Yang, Yunbo,Ridderbusch, Isabelle C,Kircher, Tilo,Hamm, Alfons O,Straube, Benjamin,Richter, Jan,eng,Transl Psychiatry. 2020 Apr 21;10(1):110. doi: 10.1038/s41398-020-0786-x.","Extinction learning is suggested to be a central mechanism during exposure-based cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. A positive association between the patients' pretreatment extinction learning performance and treatment outcome would corroborate the hypothesis. Indeed, there is first correlational evidence between reduced extinction learning and therapy efficacy. However, the results of these association studies may be hampered by extinction-training protocols that do not match treatment procedures. Therefore, we developed an extinction-training protocol highly tailored to the procedure of exposure therapy and tested it in two samples of 46 subjects in total. By using instructed fear acquisition training, including a consolidation period overnight, we wanted to ensure that the conditioned fear response was well established prior to extinction training, which is the case in patients with anxiety disorders prior to treatment. Moreover, the extinction learning process was analyzed on multiple response levels, comprising unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings, autonomic responses, defensive brain stem reflexes, and neural activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using this protocol, we found robust fear conditioning and slow-speed extinction learning. We also observed within-group heterogeneity in extinction learning, albeit a stable fear response at the beginning of the extinction training. Finally, we found discordance between different response systems, suggesting that multiple processes are involved in extinction learning. The paradigm presented here might help to ameliorate the association between extinction learning performance assessed in the laboratory and therapy outcomes and thus facilitate translational science in anxiety disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317621,N,no corr,,,

Therefore, this study was undertaken to test our hypothesis that FM patients would demonstrate elevated brain responses to both pain onset and offset-2 salient sensory events of opposing valences. METHODS: Thirty-eight FM patients (mean +/- SD age 46.1 +/- 13.4 years; 33 women) and 15 healthy controls (mean +/- SD age 45.5 +/- 12.4; 10 women) received a moderately painful pressure stimulus to the leg during blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging. Stimulus onset and offset transients were analyzed using a general linear model as stick functions. RESULTS: During pain onset, higher BOLD signal response was observed in FM patients compared to healthy controls in dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC and VLPFC, respectively), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), frontal pole, and precentral gyrus (PrCG). During pain offset, higher and more widespread BOLD signal response was demonstrated in FM patients compared to controls in frontal regions significantly hyperactivated in response to onset. In FM patients, some of these responses were positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (VLPFC, onset; r = 0.35, P = 0.03), pain catastrophizing scores (DLPFC, offset; r = 0.33, P = 0.04), or negatively correlated with stimulus intensity (OFC, offset; r = -0.35, P = 0.03) (PrCG, offset; r = -0.39, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the increased sensitivity exhibited by FM patients in response to the onset and offset of painful stimuli may reflect a more generalized hypersensitivity to salient sensory events, and that brain hyperactivation may be a mechanism potentially involved in the generalized hypervigilance to salient stimuli in FM.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32017421,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Epub 2020 Feb 7.","Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is frequently used to study brain function; but, it is unclear whether BOLD-signal fluctuation amplitude and functional connectivity are associated with vascular factors, and how vascular-health factors are reflected in rs-fMRI metrics in the healthy population. As arterial stiffening is a known age-related cardiovascular risk factor, we investigated the associations between aortic stiffening (as measured using pulse-wave velocity [PWV]) and rs-fMRI metrics. We used cardiac MRI to measure aortic PWV (an established indicator of whole-body vascular stiffness), as well as dual-echo pseudo-continuous arterial-spin labeling to measure BOLD and CBF dynamics simultaneously in a group of generally healthy adults. We found that: (1) higher aortic PWV is associated with lower variance in the resting-state BOLD signal; (2) higher PWV is also associated with lower BOLD-based resting-state functional connectivity; (3) regions showing lower connectivity do not fully overlap with those showing lower BOLD variance with higher PWV; (4) CBF signal variance is a significant mediator of the above findings, only when averaged across regions-of-interest. Furthermore, we found no significant association between BOLD signal variance and systolic blood pressure, which is also a known predictor of vascular stiffness. Age-related vascular stiffness, as measured by PWV, provides a unique scenario to demonstrate the extent of vascular bias in rs-fMRI signal fluctuations and functional connectivity. These findings suggest that a substantial portion of age-related rs-fMRI differences may be driven by vascular effects rather than directly by brain function.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034832,N,no corr,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with clinical PD who had decreased HMR were enrolled. An autonomic symptom was evaluated using a head-up tilt test and the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS). An I-123 MIBG scan and F-18 FP-CIT positron emission tomography (PET) were performed. All of the patients were classified into three groups according to the WR. The differences in patient characteristics and the imaging parameters among the three groups were evaluated, and a correlation analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The frequency of orthostatic hypotension was significantly different among the three groups. The difference in systolic pressure (dSysPr) and the difference in diastolic pressure (dDiaPr) of group 3 was significantly larger than those of groups 1 and 2. From the correlation analysis, it can be seen that age, Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage, dSysPr, and dDiaPr had a weak positive correlation with the WR. The total CASS score was significantly higher in group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2. The WR had a moderate positive correlation with the cardiosympathetic score and the total CASS score. CONCLUSION: The WR is related to autonomic dysfunction. An I-123 MIBG cardiac scan is considered to be a good method to evaluate not only the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but also the degree of autonomic dysfunction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32134983,N,no corr,,,

We consecutively screened forty-seven patients with de novo PD from 2012 to 2017 and enrolled 32 patients. The gray matter volumes, white matter tracts, and striatal dopaminergic activity between PD without fatigue and with fatigue were compared. The correlation between fatigue and striatal dopaminergic activity was also analyzed. Our data did not show any significant difference in gray matter volume between PD without fatigue and with fatigue (familywise error [FWE] corrected p > 0.05) but revealed significantly higher mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values for all analyzed white matter tracts in PD with fatigue (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected p < 0.05), except left cingulum-hippocampus (CH), right superior longitudinal fasciculus, and right longitudinal fasciculus temporal part (FDR corrected p > 0.06); lower mean diffusivity (MD) values for all analyzed white matter tracts in PD with fatigue (FDR corrected p < 0.05), except in the left CH and uncinate fasciculus (FDR corrected p > 0.05). The mean radial diffusivity (RD) values, except for the left CH (FDR corrected p = 0.0576), were also significantly lower (FDR corrected p < 0.05). There was no difference in dopaminergic deficits between PD without fatigue and PD with fatigue (p > 0.50). The alteration of the white matter tract may reflect the degree of fatigue in PD.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural correlates associated with IM band variability in cardiac and respiratory rate and identified dissociable networks for LF, IM, and HF bands in both modalities. Cardiac and respiratory IM band fluctuations correlated with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the mid and posterior insula and the secondary somatosensory area, that is, regions related to interoceptive perception.

Because changing the field-of-view (FoV) allows new visual information to be obtained, we were motivated to investigate whether naturalistic viewing with varying FoV based on active eye movement can enhance the viewing experience of natural stimuli, such as those found in a video clip with a 360 degrees FoV in an MRI scanner. To this end, we developed a novel naturalistic viewing paradigm based on real-time eye-gaze tracking while participants were watching a 360 degrees panoramic video during fMRI acquisition. The gaze position of the participants was recorded using an eye-tracking computer and then transmitted to a stimulus presentation computer via a TCP/IP connection. The identified gaze position was then used to alter the participants' FoV of the video clip in real-time, so the participants could change their FoV to fully explore the 360 degrees video clip (referred to in this paper as active viewing). The gaze position of one participant while watching a video was used to change the FoV of the same video clip for a paired participant (referred to as yoked or passive viewing). Four 360 degrees panoramic videos were used as stimuli, divided into categories based on the brightness level (i.e., bright vs. dark) and location (i.e., nature vs. city). Each of the subjects participated in the active viewing of one of the two nature videos and one of the two city videos and then engaged in the passive viewing of the other video in each category, followed by conventional viewing with a fixed FoV (referred to as fixed viewing) after each of the active or passive viewings. Forty-eight healthy volunteers participated in the study, and data from 42 of these participants were used in the analysis. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was conducted in a multiple regression framework using representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) codes to accommodate all of the information regarding neuronal activations from fMRI analysis and the participants' subjective ratings of their viewing experience with the four video clips and with the two contrasting viewing conditions (i.e., ""active-fixed"" and ""passive-fixed""). It was found that the participants' naturalistic viewing experience of the video clips was substantially more immersive with active viewing than with passive and fixed viewing. The RSA using the RDM codes revealed the brain regions associated with the viewing experience, including eye movement and spatial navigation in the superior frontal area (of Brodmann's area 6) and the inferior/superior parietal areas, respectively. Brain regions potentially associated with cognitive and affective processing during the viewing of the video, such as the default-mode networks and insular/Rolandic operculum areas, were also identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has used the participants' eye movements to interactively change their FoV for 360 degrees panoramic video clips in real-time. Our method of utilizing the MRI environment can be further extended to other environments such as electroencephalography and behavioral research. It would also be feasible to apply our method to virtual reality and/or augmented reality systems to maximize user experience based on their eye movement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32057996,N,no corr with phys of interest,,,

Older adults may also have an impaired relationship between changes in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow; however, previous reports conflict. This study aimed to compare the blood pressure and cerebral blood flow responses to both repeated and sustained stand-to-sit transitions in young and older adults, and to assess the relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity. METHODS: In 20 young (age: 24 +/- 4 years) and 20 older (age: 71 +/- 7 years) adults we compared middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAv), end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PET CO2 ), and blood pressure (mean arterial blood pressure [MAP]) during repeated stand-to-sit (10 s standing and 10 s sitting) and sustained stand-to-sit (3 min standing followed by 2 min sitting) transitions. Cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in carbon dioxide levels was assessed using a repeated breath-hold test. RESULTS: The % change in MCAv per % change in MAP (%MCAv/%MAP) was higher in the older adults than in the young adults during repeated stand-to-sit transitions. During the sustained protocol the %MCAv/%MAP response was similar in both age groups. A high %MCAv/%MAP response during the repeated stand-to-sit protocol was associated with low cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 (r = -.39; p < .01), which was significantly lower in the older adults. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the higher %MCAv/%MAP during repeated stand-sit transitions was associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity. Impairments in endothelial function and vascular stiffness with age may contribute to the altered transient cerebral pressure-flow responses in older adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32378357,N,no brain data,,,

Hence, we developed a standardized chill paradigm and used fMRI to test neural responses of 16 healthy volunteers to pleasant and unpleasant emotional sound material while collecting subjective reports of chill intensity and skin conductance response data. As predicted, we found chill-associated increases in autonomic arousal regardless of the valence of the sound material. Apart from activity in primary and higher auditory cortices, both pleasant and unpleasant chills were associated with anterior insula, thalamus and basal ganglia activity. In contrast, amygdala responses were observed only in association with chills elicited by unpleasant sounds. Thus, chills elicited by pleasant and unpleasant sounds share activity in a neural network that may be specifically involved in the arousal component of an emotional experience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31812503,N,no corr,,,

A similar pattern was found in colon (DM: median volume 1064 cm(3) [IQR; 882-1312] vs HC: median 939 cm(3) [IQR; 785-1081; P = .13] and DM: median 1.22 SUV (IQR; 1.08-1.36) vs HC: median 1.42 SUV (IQR; 1.32-1.53; P = .03). Furthermore, patients had significantly reduced pancreatic volume (DM: median 53 cm(3) [IQR; 41-69] vs HC: median 98 cm(3) [IQR;82-110; P < .01]) and reduced PET uptake of the pancreas (DM: median 13.14 SUV [IQR;9.58-15.82] vs HC: median 21.46 SUV [IQR;18.97-24.06; P < .01]) as well as the adrenal gland (DM: median 7.62 SUV [IQR;7.61;15.82] vs HC: median 15.51 SUV [IQR;12.22;19.49; P = .03]).

Association of Vascular Risk Factors With beta-Amyloid Peptide and Tau Burdens in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals and Its Interaction With Vascular Medication Use,JAMA Netw Open,"Kobe, Theresa,Gonneaud, Julie,Pichet Binette, Alexa,Meyer, Pierre-Francois,McSweeney, Melissa,Rosa-Neto, Pedro,Breitner, John C S,Poirier, Judes,Villeneuve, Sylvia,(PREVENT-AD),eng,JAMA Netw Open. 2020 Feb 5;3(2):e1920780. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.20780.","Importance: Vascular risk factors are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), but it is unclear whether there is a direct association of these risk factors with AD pathogenesis. Objectives: To assess the associations of vascular risk factors with AD pathogenesis in asymptomatic individuals, and to test whether this association is moderated among individuals who use vascular medications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the Presymptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer Disease (PREVENT-AD) cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 55 to 82 years with a parental or multiple-sibling history of sporadic AD, who were recruited via advertisement from the greater Montreal, Quebec, Canada, metropolitan area. Participants were enrolled between September 9, 2011, to May, 3, 2017, and stratified by use vs no use of vascular medications. Data were analyzed July 1, 2018, to April 5, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Principal analyses investigated associations of total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and a combined vascular risk score (measured using the Framingham Coronary Risk Profile) with global beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and entorhinal tau burden as measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Potential moderating associations of use of vascular medications with these associations were examined. Secondary similar analyses considered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta1-42 and phosphorylated tau levels. Results: Among 215 participants (mean [SD] age, 62.3 [5.0] years; 161 [74.8%] women), 120 participants underwent PET, including 75 participants (62.5%) who were not using vascular medications, and 162 participants underwent CSF assessment, including 113 participants (69.8%) who were not using vascular medications. There was an overlap of 67 participants who underwent PET and CSF assessment. Interaction analyses showed that among participants not using vascular medications, higher Abeta deposition as measured by PET was associated with higher total cholesterol level (beta = -0.002 [SE, 0.001]; P = .02), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (beta = -0.002 [SE, 0.001]; P = .006), systolic blood pressure (beta = -0.006 [SE, 0.002]; P = .02), pulse pressure (beta = -0.007 [SE, 0.002]; P = .004), and Framingham Coronary Risk Profile score (beta = -0.038 [SE, 0.011]; P = .001), but such associations were absent in participants who used vascular medications. Interactions were also found between vascular medication use and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -3.302 [SE, 1.540]; P = .03), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 1.546 [SE, 0.754]; P = .04), and Framingham Coronary Risk Profile score (beta = 23.102 [SE, 10.993]; P = .04) on Abeta1-42 burden as measured in CSF. Higher Framingham Coronary Risk Profile scores were associated with reduced tau burden among participants using vascular medications but not among participants not using vascular medications (interaction, beta = -0.010 [SE, 0.005]; P = .046). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings corroborate previously reported associations of vascular risk factors with Abeta burden but not tau burden. However, these associations were found only among individuals who were not using vascular medications. These results suggest that medication use or other control of vascular risk factors should be considered in Alzheimer disease prevention trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031648,N,pharma,,,

Epub 2020 Jan 7.","Extinction of appetitive conditioning is regarded as an important model for the treatment of psychiatric disorders like addiction. However, very few studies have investigated its neural correlates. Therefore, we investigated neural correlates of appetitive extinction in a large human sample including all genders (N = 76, 40 females) to replicate and extend results from a previous study. During differential appetitive conditioning, one stimulus (CS+) was paired with the chance to win a monetary reward, whereas another stimulus (CS-) was not. During appetitive extinction on the next day, neither the CS+ nor the CS- were reinforced. After successful acquisition of appetitive conditioning, the extinction phase elicited significant reductions of valence and arousal ratings toward the CS+ and a significant reduction in skin conductance responses to the CS+ from early to late extinction. On a neural level, early extinction showed significant differential (CS+ - CS-) activation in dACC and hippocampus, whereas involvement of the vACC and caudate nucleus did not replicate. The differential activation of amygdala and nucleus accumbens during late extinction was replicated, with the amygdala displaying significantly higher differential activation during the late phase of extinction as compared to the early phase of extinction. We show discernible signals for reward learning and extinction in subregions of amygdala and nucleus accumbens after extinction learning. This successful replication underlines the role of nucleus accumbens and amygdala in neural models of appetitive extinction in humans that was previously only based on animal findings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31909526,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2019 Aug 6.","BACKGROUND: The startle eye-blink is the cross-species translational tool to study defensive behavior in affective neuroscience with relevance to a broad range of neuropsychiatric conditions. It makes use of the startle reflex, a defensive response elicited by an immediate, unexpected sensory event, which is potentiated when evoked during threat and inhibited during safety. In contrast to skin conductance responses or pupil dilation, modulation of the startle reflex is valence specific. Rodent models implicate a modulatory pathway centering on the brainstem (i.e., nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis) and the centromedial amygdala as key hubs for flexibly integrating valence information into differential startle magnitude. Technical advances now allow for the investigation of this pathway using combined facial electromyography and functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans. METHODS: We employed a multimethodological approach combining trial-by-trial facial eye-blink startle electromyography and brainstem- and amygdala-specific functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans. Validating the robustness and reproducibility of our findings, we provide evidence from two different paradigms (fear-potentiated startle, affect-modulated startle) in two independent studies (N = 43 and N = 55). RESULTS: We provide key evidence for a conserved neural pathway for acoustic startle modulation between humans and rodents. Furthermore, we provide the crucial direct link between electromyography startle eye-blink magnitude and neural response strength. Finally, we demonstrate a dissociation between arousal-specific amygdala responding and triggered valence-specific amygdala responding. CONCLUSIONS: We provide neurobiologically based evidence for the strong translational value of startle responding and argue that startle-evoked amygdala responding and its affective modulation may hold promise as an important novel tool for affective neuroscience and its clinical translation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547934,N,no corr,,,

However, there is no standardized method for cell trafficking and in vivo CAR T-cell monitoring. We assessed the feasibility of real-time in vivo 89Zr-p-Isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (Df-Bz-NCS, DFO) labeled CAR T-cell trafficking using positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: The 89Zr-DFO radiolabeling efficiency of Jurkat/CAR and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC)/CAR T-cells was 70%-79%, and cell radiolabeling activity was 98.1-103.6 kBq/106 cells. Cell viability after radiolabeling was >95%. Cell proliferation was not significantly different during the early period after radiolabeling, compared with unlabeled cells; however, the proliferative capacity decreased over time (day 7 after labeling). IL-2 or IFN-gamma secretion was not significantly different between unlabeled and labeled CAR T-cells. PET/magnetic resonance imaging in the xenograft model showed that most of the 89Zr-DFO-labeled Jurkat/CAR T-cells were distributed in the lung (24.4% +/- 3.4%ID) and liver (22.9% +/- 5.6%ID) by one hour after injection. The cells gradually migrated from the lung to the liver and spleen by day 1, and remained stable in these sites until day 7 (on day 7: lung 3.9% +/- 0.3%ID, liver 36.4% +/- 2.7%ID, spleen 1.4% +/- 0.3%ID). No significant accumulation of labeled cells was identified in tumors. A similar pattern was observed in ex vivo biodistributions on day 7 (lung 3.0% +/- 1.0%ID, liver 19.8% +/- 2.2%ID, spleen 2.3% +/- 1.7%ID). 89Zr-DFO-labeled hPBMC/CAR T-cells showed a similar distribution, compared with Jurkat/CAR T-cells, on serial PET images. CAR T cell distribution was cross-confirmed by flow cytometry, Alu polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: Real-time in vivo cell trafficking is feasible using PET imaging of 89Zr-DFO-labeled CAR T-cells. This can be used to investigate cellular kinetics, initial in vivo biodistribution, and safety profiles in future CAR T-cell development.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31910217,N,methods paper,,,

Epub 2020 Mar 9.","Adaptation capacity is critical for maintaining cognition, yet it is understudied in groups at risk for dementia. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) is critical for neurovisceral integration and is a key contributor to adaptation capacity. To determine the central nervous system's top-down regulation of ANS, we conducted a mechanistic randomized controlled trial study, using a 6-week processing speed and attention (PS/A)-targeted intervention. Eighty-four older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) were randomized to a 6-week PS/A-targeted intervention or an active control without PS/A. Utilizing repeated measures (i.e., PS/A test different from the intervention, resting and cognitive task-based ECG, and resting fMRI) at baseline, immediately post-intervention (post-test), and 6-month follow-up, we aimed to test whether PS/A causally influences vagal control of ANS via their shared central neural pathways in aMCI. We indexed vagal control of ANS using high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) extracted from ECG data. Functional brain connectivity patterns were extracted from fMRI using advanced statistical tools. Compared to the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvement in PS/A, HF-HRV, salience network (SN), central executive network (CEN), and frontal parietal network (FPN) connectivity at post-test; the effect on SN, CEN, and FPN remained at 6-month follow-up. Changes in PS/A and SN connectivity significantly predicted change in HF-HRV from baseline to post-test and/or 6-month-follow-up. Age, neurodegeneration, nor sex did not affect these relationships. This work provides novel support for top-down regulation of PS/A and associated SN on vagal control of ANS. Intervening PS/A may be a viable approach for promoting adaptation capacity in groups at risk for dementia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32165263,N,clincial,,,

Because brain regions of the central autonomic network largely overlap with brain regions related to the neural response to emotion and stress, the central autonomic network may mediate the autonomic response to negative emotional stimuli. We aimed to obtain evidence to determine whether neural connectivity of the central autonomic network is altered in individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD) when they are exposed to negative emotional stimuli. METHODS: Effective (directional) connectivity (EC) analysis using dynamic causal modeling was applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 23 subjects with CUD and 23 control subjects of the Human Connectome Project while they performed an emotional face-matching task with interleaving periods of negative-face (fearful/angry) and neutral-shape stimuli. The EC difference (modulatory change) was measured during the negative-face trials relative to the neutral-shape trials. RESULTS: The CUD group was similar to the control group in nonimaging measures and brain activations but showed greater modulatory changes in left amygdala to hypothalamus EC (positively associated with Perceived Stress Scale score), right amygdala to bilateral fusiform gyri ECs (positively associated with Perceived Stress Scale score), and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to bilateral fusiform gyri ECs (negatively associated with Perceived Stress Scale score). CONCLUSIONS: Left amygdala to hypothalamus EC and right amygdala to bilateral fusiform gyri ECs are possibly part of circuits underlying the risk of individuals with CUD to stress-related disorders. Correspondingly, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to bilateral fusiform gyri ECs are possibly part of circuits reflecting a protective mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345781,N,no phys of interest,,,

Here, we introduce a selective extinction through cognitive evaluation (SECE) task in which information is cognitively evaluated on a trial-by-trial basis to ascertain the extinction contingencies. Participants were conditioned to expect an electric shock during the presentation of one of two letters (CS+/CS-). During the SECE task, the letters were presented within words belonging to two categories, one of which indicated safety (COG-_CS+ trials), while risk of shock was maintained for the other category (COG+_CS+ trials). Skin conductance responses indicated that participants reduced their response to COG-_CS+ trials compared to COG+_CS+ trials. Clusters in bilateral insula and anterior cingulate cortex showed activation for COG+_CS+ trials that was reduced for COG-_CS+ trials. A network of brain regions, including left inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral temporal and parietal cortices showed greater activation for COG-_CS+ versus COG+_CS+ trials. This is consistent with the semantic processing and decision-making necessary to evaluate the trial contingencies. We compared activation in the SECE task to activation in a cognitive reappraisal task in which participants were asked to attend to, or regulate their emotional reactions to affective IAPS images. This task replicated prefrontal activation seen in previous reappraisal studies. A voxelwise conjunction analysis found no overlap between the cognitive reappraisal and the SECE task, but we did find evidence for common activation in follow-up ROI analyses, supporting the idea of common lateral prefrontal mechanisms involved in both processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32043646,N,no corr,,,
Multimodal Categorical and Dimensional Approaches to Understanding Threat Conditioning and Its Extinction in Individuals With Anxiety Disorders,JAMA Psychiatry,"Marin, Marie-France,Hammoud, Mira Z,Klumpp, Heide,Simon, Naomi M,Milad, Mohammed R,eng,JAMA Psychiatry. 2020 Feb 5. pii: 2760504. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.4833.","Importance: The Research Domain Criteria project of the National Institute of Mental Health aims to guide neuropsychiatry toward precision medicine. Its inception was partly in response to the overlap of clinical manifestations between different DSM-IV diagnoses within a category. For example, anxiety disorders comprise a DSM-IV category that includes diagnoses that differ from each other but are all characterized by dysregulated fear levels. Whether DSM-IV-based and Research Domain Criteria-based analytic approaches provide distinct or similar information with regard to the fear circuitry of individuals with anxiety disorders has not been directly tested. Objective: To use a threat conditioning and extinction protocol to conduct categorical (DSM-IV-based) and dimensional (Research Domain Criteria-based) assessments of psychophysiological, neural, and psychometric responses in individuals with and without anxiety disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston between March 2013 and May 2015. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess psychophysiological, neural, and psychometric responses among adults aged 18 to 65 years with specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder as well as a control group of adults without anxiety disorders. Data were analyzed between May 2018 and April 2019. Exposures: A 2-day threat conditioning and extinction protocol. Main Outcomes and Measures: Skin conductance responses and blood oxygenated level-dependent responses were measured during the threat and extinction protocol. The categorical analysis was performed by grouping participants based on their primary DSM-IV diagnosis. The dimensional analysis was performed by regrouping participants, irrespective of their diagnoses, based on their skin conductance responses to shock delivery during threat conditioning. Results: This cross-sectional study of 114 adults aged 18 to 65 years included 93 participants (34 men and 59 women; mean [SD] age, 29.7 [11.1] years) with at least 1 anxiety disorder (specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or panic disorder) and 21 participants (11 men and 10 women) without an anxiety disorder. The categorical DSM-IV-based approach indicated that all anxiety disorder groups exhibited hypoactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during extinction recall (etap2 = 0.15; P = .004). The Research Domain Criteria-based approach revealed that higher arousal to the unconditioned stimulus was associated with higher threat responses during extinction recall (for skin conductance responses, etap2 = 0.21; P = .01 and in functional magnetic resonance imaging results, etap2 = 0.12; P = .02). The direct comparison of DSM-IV-based vs Research Domain Criteria-based results did not yield significant findings (etap2 values ranged from 0.02 to 0.078; P values ranged from .09 to .98), suggesting no overlap between the approaches. Conclusions and Relevance: The data obtained from both approaches indicated complementary yet distinct findings. The findings highlight the validity and importance of using both categorical and dimensional approaches to optimize understanding of the etiology and treatment of anxiety symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32022832,N,no corr,,,

SCR has been shown to be highly variable, and absence of SC reactivity is sometimes used as criteria for excluding data. It is, however, possible that low or no SC reactivity is the result of a distinct biological signature that underlies individual differences in SCR reactivity. This study examined neural correlates associated with the near absence of SCR conditionability. Archival data from 109 healthy adults aged 18-60 years were pooled. All individuals had participated in a fear conditioning protocol in a fMRI environment, during which two cues were partially reinforced (CS+) with a shock and a third cue was not (CS-). Using SCR to the conditioned stimuli and differential SCR (CS+ minus CS-), we created two groups of 30 individuals: low conditioners (defined as those showing the smallest SCR to the CS+ and smallest differential SCR) and high conditioners (defined as those showing the largest SCR to the CS+ and largest differential SCR). Our analyses showed differences in patterns of brain activations between these two groups during conditioning in the following regions: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and insular cortex. Our findings suggest that low or absent SCR conditionability is associated with hypoactivation of brain regions involved in fear learning and expression. This highlights the need to be cautious when excluding SCR nonconditioners and to consider the potential implications of such exclusion when interpreting the findings from studies of conditioned fear.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758048,Y,corr,uns,,Y

In everyday life angry people react in different ways, from being agitated with an increased heart rate to remaining silent or detached. Neuroimaging evidence supports the role of mid-posterior insula and midcingulate cortex/MCC as key nodes of a sensorimotor network that predominantly responds to salient stimuli, integration of interoceptive and autonomic information, as well as to awareness of bodily movements for coordinated motion. However, there is still a lack of clarity concerning how interindividual variability in bodily states reactions drives the connectivity within these key nodes in the sensorimotor network during anger processing. Therefore, we investigated whether individual differences in body-centered emotional experience, that is an active (inward prone) or inactive (outward prone) emotion-body connection disposition, would differently affect the information flow within these brain regions. Two groups of participants underwent fMRI scanning session watching video clips of actors performing simple actions with angry and joyful facial expressions. The whole-brain group-by-session interaction analysis showed that the bilateral insula and the right MCC were selectively activated by inward group during the angry session, whereas the outward group activated more the precuneus during the joyful session. Accordingly, dynamic causal modeling analyses (DCM) revealed an excitatory modulatory effect exerted by anger all over the insulae-MCC connectivity in the inward group, whereas in the outward group the modulatory effect exerted was inhibitory. Modeling the variability related to individual differences in body-centered emotional experience allowed to better explain to what extent subjective dispositions contributed to the insular activity and its connectivity. In addition, from the perspective of a hierarchical model of neurovisceral integration, these findings add knowledge to the multiple ways which the insula and MCC dynamically integrate affective and bodily aspects of the human experience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32053605,N,FC study,,,

Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET-CT) measures functional changes in the brain metabolic activity, identified by the changes in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as determined by the changes of F-18 Fluoro-deoxyglucose ((18) F FDG) tracer within brain tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine patients were recruited to explore the changes in PET-CT imaging at baseline and four-weeks post implantation of bilateral L2 DRG neurostimulation leads and implantable pulse generator (IPG). PET-CT scans were performed 30 min following an IV injection of 250+/-10% MBq of (18) F FDG tracer. Fifteen frames were acquired in 15 min. PET list-mode raw data were reconstructed and normalized appropriately to a brain anatomical atlas. RESULTS: Nine patients were recruited to the study, where PET-CT imaging data for five patients were analyzed. The right and left insular cortex, primary and secondary somato-sensory cortices, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and the midline periaqueductal areas, were assessed for any changes in the metabolic activity. A total of 85 pain matrix regions were delineated SUV (standardized uptake value)MAX , SUV MEAN +/- SD, and SUVPEAK were calculated for each of these regions of the brain and were compared pre- and post-L2 DRG stimulation. Sixty-one of the 85 matrices showed an increase in metabolic activity whereas 24 matrices showed a reduction in metabolic activity. CONCLUSION: This is the first ever study reporting the changes in cerebral metabolic activity and multi-frame static brain (18) F FDG PET imaging after L2 DRG stimulation for discogenic low back pain. Predominantly an increased metabolic activity in nociceptive brain matrices are seen with an increased in F(18) F FDG uptake following L2 DRG stimulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103593,N,no phys of interest,,,

Previous studies have shown that this reflex can be modulated by the vagus nerve, leading to an inhibition of the parasympathetic output of the reflex in healthy participants. The aim of the present study was to characterize neural correlates of the modulatory effect of noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) on the trigeminal autonomic reflex. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy participants were included in a 2-day, randomized, single-blind, within-subject design. The reflex was activated inside the MRI scanner using kinetic oscillation stimulation placed in the left nostril, resulting in an increase in lacrimation. After the first fMRI session, the participants received either sham vagus nerve stimulation or nVNS outside the scanner and underwent a subsequent fMRI session. RESULTS: nVNS prompted an increase in activation of the left pontine nucleus and a decreased activation of the right parahippocampal gyrus. Psychophysiologic interaction analyses revealed an increased functional connectivity between the left pontine nucleus and the right hypothalamus and a decreased functional connectivity between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the bilateral spinal trigeminal nuclei (sTN). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a complex network involved in the modulatory effect of nVNS including the hypothalamus, the sTN, the pontine nucleus, and the parahippocampal gyrus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32029547,N,no corr,,,

Epub 2019 Aug 5.","BACKGROUND: The role of the trigeminal autonomic reflex in headache syndromes, such as cluster headache, is undisputed but sparsely investigated. The aim of the present study was therefore, to identify neural correlates that play a role in the initiation of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. We further aimed to discriminate between components of the reflex that are involved in nociceptive compared to non-nociceptive processing. METHODS: Kinetic Oscillation Stimulation (KOS) in the left nostril was applied in order to provoke autonomic symptoms (e.g. lacrimation) via the trigeminal autonomic reflex in 26 healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Unpleasantness and painfulness were assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS), in order to assess the quality of the stimulus (e.g. pain or no pain). RESULTS: During non-painful activation, specific regions involved in the trigeminal autonomic reflex became activated, including several brainstem nuclei but also cerebellar and bilateral insular regions. However, when the input leading to activation of the trigeminal autonomic reflex was perceived as painful, activation of the anterior hypothalamus, the locus coeruleus (LC), the ventral posteriomedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM), as well as an activation of ipsilateral insular regions, was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the anterior hypothalamus, besides the thalamus and specific brain stem regions, play a significant role in networks that mediate autonomic output (e.g. lacrimation) following trigeminal input, but only if the trigeminal system is activated by a stimulus comprising a painful component.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382763,N,no corr,,,

Generalization across conceptually related objects has been hypothesized based on clinical observation in PTSD, but the neural mechanisms remain unexplored. Recent trauma-exposed military veterans (n = 46) were grouped into PTSD (n = 23) and non-PTSD (n = 23). Participants learned to generalize fear across conceptual categories (animals or tools) of semantically related items that were partially reinforced by shock during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conditioned fear learning was quantified by shock expectancy and skin conductance response (SCR). Relative to veteran controls, PTSD subjects exhibited a stronger neural response associated with fear generalization to the reinforced object category in the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, occipitotemporal cortex, and insula (Z > 2.3; p < 0.05; whole-brain corrected). Based on SCR, both groups generalized the shock contingency to the reinforced conceptual category, but learning was not significantly different between groups. We found that PTSD was associated with an enhanced neural response in fronto-limbic, midline, and occipitotemporal regions to a learned representation of threat that is based on previously established conceptual knowledge of the relationship between basic-level exemplars within a semantic category. Behaviorally, veterans with PTSD were somewhat slower to differentiate threat and safety categories as compared with trauma-exposed veteran controls owing in part to an initial overgeneralized behavioral response to the safe category.

By correlating representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) derived from multiple pairwise classifications of neural responses to different facial expressions (neutral, happy, fearful, angry), we found early EEG time windows (starting around 130 ms) to match fMRI data from primary visual cortex (V1), and later time windows (starting around 190 ms) to match data from lateral occipital, fusiform face complex, and temporal-parietal-occipital junction (TPOJ). According to model comparisons, the EEG classification results were based more on low-level visual features than expression intensities or categories. In fMRI, the model comparisons revealed change along the processing hierarchy, from low-level visual feature coding in V1 to coding of intensity of expressions in the right TPOJ.

Whether this neuroprotective effect was observed in patients with acute ischemic stroke remains unknown. Objective: To determine whether treatment with remote ischemic perconditioning administered to the leg of patients with acute ischemic stroke can reduce brain infarction volume growth. Design, Setting, and Participants: This proof-of-concept multicenter prospective randomized open-label with blinded end point clinical trial was performed from January 12, 2015, to May 2, 2018. Patients were recruited from 11 stroke centers in France. Of the 188 patients who received magnetic resonance imaging within 6 hours of symptom onset and were confirmed to have carotid ischemic stroke, 93 were randomized to receive treatment with lower-limb remote ischemic perconditioning in addition to standard care (the intervention group), and 95 were randomized to receive standard care alone (the control group). Interventions: Randomization on a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with remote ischemic perconditioning (4 cycles of 5-minute inflations and 5-minute deflations to the thigh to 110 mm Hg above systolic blood pressure) in addition to standard care or standard care alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The change in brain infarction volume growth between baseline and 24 hours, measured by a diffusion-weighted sequence of magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain. Results: A total of 188 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.2 [15.7] years; 98 men [52.1%]) were included in this intention-to-treat analysis. At hospital admission, the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10 (interquartile range [IQR], 6-16) and the median brain infarction volume was 11.4 cm3 (IQR, 3.6-35.8 cm3); 164 patients (87.2%) received intravenous thrombolysis, and 64 patients (34.0%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy. The median increase in brain infarction growth was 0.30 cm3 (IQR, 0.11-0.48 cm3) in the intervention group and 0.37 cm3 (IQR, 0.19-0.55 cm3) in the control group (mean between-group difference on loge-transformed change, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.33 to 0.18; P = .57). An excellent outcome (defined as a score of 0-1 on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale or a score equal to the prestroke modified Rankin Scale score) was observed in 46 of 90 patients (51.1%) in the intervention group and 37 of 91 patients (40.7%) in the control group (P = .12).

Epub 2019 Oct 5.","Breathing rate and depth influence the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood, altering cerebral blood flow and thus functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Such respiratory fluctuations can have substantial influence in studies of fMRI signal covariance in subjects at rest, the so-called ""resting state functional connectivity"" technique. If respiration is monitored during fMRI scanning, it is typically done using a belt about the subject's abdomen to record abdominal circumference. Several measures have been derived from these belt records, including the windowed envelope of the waveform (ENV), the windowed variance in the waveform (respiration variation, RV), and a measure of the amplitude of each breath divided by the cycle time of the breath (respiration volume per time, RVT). Any attempt to gauge respiratory contributions to fMRI signals requires a respiratory measure, but little is known about how these measures compare to each other, or how they perform beyond the small studies in which they were initially proposed. Here, we examine the properties of these measures in hundreds of healthy young adults scanned for an hour each at rest, a subset of the Human Connectome Project chosen for having high-quality physiological records. We find: 1) ENV, RV, and RVT are all correlated, and ENV and RV are more highly correlated to each other than to RVT; 2) respiratory events like deep breaths exhibit characteristic heart rate elevations, fMRI signal changes, head motions, and image quality abnormalities time-locked to large deflections in the belt traces; 3) all measures can ""miss"" deep breaths; 4) RVT ""misses"" deep breaths more than ENV or RV; 5) all respiratory measures change systematically over the course of a 14.4-min scan. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature and ways to move forward in modeling respiratory influences on fMRI scans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589990,N,methods paper,,,

Epub 2019 Dec 20.","INTRODUCTION: The increase in expression of tryptophan 2, 3-dioxygenases (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) have been reported as potential tumor biomarkers. TDO and IDO are enzymes that catalyze the first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway. Positron emitting tomography (PET) tracers investigating the kynurenine pathway may allow for the detection of different disease pathologies in vivo including cancer. However, current PET tracers being developed for TDO and IDO have suffered from either multi-step low yielding syntheses or de-fluorination of the tracer in vivo. RESULTS: TDO inhibitors based on 6-fluoroindole with C3 substituents are a class of small molecules that have been shown to bind to TDO effectively, restore tryptophan concentration and decrease the production of immunosuppressive metabolites. The compound 6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-1H-indole has been reported to have high in vitro affinity for TDO. Herein we report the fully automated radiosynthesis of 6-[(18)F]fluoro-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-1H-indole [(18)F]4 using a copper-mediated nucleophilic (18)F-fluorination resulting in a non-corrected yield of 5 to 6% of the tracer with a radiochemical purity of >99% after 4 h. Small animal dynamic PET/CT imaging of [(18)F]4 intravenously injected into normal C57BL/6 mice revealed rapid accumulation in heart and brain, reaching maximum occupancy in heart (10.9% ID/g) and brain (8.1% ID/g) at 1.75 min and 2.25 min, respectively. Furthermore, these in vivo studies revealed no de-fluorination of the tracer, as evidence by the absence of [(18)F]fluoride accumulation in bone. CONCLUSION: In vitro studies demonstrate that 4 has good affinity for hTDO and the radiolabeled analogue [(18)F]4 can be synthesized with suitable radiochemical yields. [(18)F]4 demonstrates good uptake in the brain and the radiolabeled compound shows no de-fluorination in vivo in C57BL/6 mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31927462,N,no phys of interest,,,
What do across-subject analyses really tell us about neural coding?,Neuropsychologia,"Ramirez, Fernando M,Revsine, Cambria,Merriam, Elisha P,eng,England,Neuropsychologia. 2020 May 10:107489. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107489.","A key challenge in human neuroscience is to gain information about patterns of neural activity using indirect measures. Multivariate pattern analysis methods testing for generalization of information across subjects have been used to support inferences regarding neural coding. One critical assumption of an important class of such methods is that anatomical normalization is suited to align spatially-structured neural patterns across individual brains. We asked whether anatomical normalization is suited for this purpose. If not, what sources of information are such across-subject cross-validated analyses likely to reveal? To investigate these questions, we implemented two-layered feedforward randomly-connected networks. A key feature of these simulations was a gain-field with a spatial structure shared across networks. To investigate whether total-signal imbalances across conditions-e.g. differences in overall activity- affect the observed pattern of results, we manipulated the energy-profile of images conforming to a pre-specified correlation structure. To investigate whether the level of granularity of the data also influences results, we manipulated the density of connections between network layers. Simulations showed that anatomical normalization is unsuited to align neural representations. Pattern similarity-relationships were explained by the observed total-signal imbalances across conditions. Further, we observed that deceptively complex representational structures emerge from arbitrary analysis choices, such as whether the data are mean-subtracted during preprocessing. These simulations also led to testable predictions regarding the distribution of low-level features in images used in recent fMRI studies that relied on leave-one-subject-out pattern analyses. Image analyses broadly confirmed these predictions. Finally, hyperalignment emerged as a principled alternative to test across-subject generalization of spatially-structured information. We illustrate cases in which hyperalignment proved successful, as well as cases in which it only partially recovered the latent correlation structure in the pattern of responses. Our results highlight the need for robust, high-resolution measurements from individual subjects. We also offer a way forward for across-subject analyses. We suggest ways to inform hyperalignment results with estimates of the strength of the signal associated with each condition. Such information can usefully constrain ensuing inferences regarding latent representational structures as well as population tuning dimensions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437761,N,no phys of interest,,,

However, the mechanisms by which supportive touch promotes analgesia are not well understood. In Study 1, we tested how three kinds of social support from a romantic partner (passive presence, gentle stroking, and handholding) affect pain ratings and skin conductance responses (SCRs). Overall, support reduced pain ratings in women, but not men, relative to baseline. Support decreased pain-related SCRs in both women and men. Though there were no significant differences across the three support conditions, effects were largest during handholding. Handholding also reduced SCRs in the supportive partner. Additionally, synchronicity in couples' SCR was correlated with reductions in self-reported pain, and individual differences in synchrony were correlated with the partner's trait empathy. In Study 2, we re-analyzed an existing dataset to explore fMRI activity related to individual differences in handholding analgesia effects in women. Increased activity in a distributed set of brain regions, including valuation-encoding frontostriatal areas, was correlated with lower pain ratings.

At the global brain level, the human MTL has been described as part of the default mode network and amygdala nuclei as parts of the salience network, with both networks collectively forming a large-scale brain system supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. We hypothesized (i) that intrinsic functional connectivity of slow activity fluctuations would reveal human MTL subsystems locally extending to the amygdala; and (ii) that these extended local subsystems would be globally embedded in large-scale brain systems supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. Capitalizing on resting-state fMRI data of three independent samples of cognitively healthy adults (one main and two replication samples: N = 101, 60, and 29, respectively), we analyzed the functional connectivity of fluctuating ongoing BOLD-activity within and outside the amygdala-MTL in a data-driven way using masked independent component and dual-regression analyses. We found that at the local level, MTL subsystems extend to the amygdala and are functionally organized along the longitudinal amygdala-MTL axis. These subsystems are characterized by consistent involvement of amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex, but variable participation of perirhinal and parahippocampal regions.

Epub 2019 Oct 21.","The energy-dissipating properties of brown adipose tissue (BAT) have been proposed as therapeutic targets for obesity and diabetes. Little is known about basal BAT activity. Capitalizing on the dense sympathetic innervation of BAT, we have previously shown that BAT can be detected in humans under resting room temperature (RT) conditions by using (S,S)-(11)C-O-methylreboxetine (MRB), a selective ligand for the norepinephrine transporter (NET). In this study, we determine whether MRB labeling of human BAT is altered by obesity. Fifteen healthy, nondiabetic Caucasian women (nine lean, age 25.6 +/- 1.7, BMI 21.8 +/- 1.3 kg/m(2); six obese age 30.8 +/- 8.8 BMI 37.9 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2)) underwent PET-CT imaging of the neck/supraclavicular region using (11)C-MRB under RT conditions. The distribution volume ratio (DVR) for (11)C-MRB was estimated via multilinear reference tissue model 2 (MRTM2) referenced to the occipital cortex. Two women (one lean and one with obesity) had no detectable BAT. Of the women with detectable BAT, women with obesity had lower (11)C-MRB DVR (0.80 +/- 0.12 BAT DVR) compared to lean (1.15 +/- 0.19 BAT DVR) (p = 0.004). Our findings are consistent with reports that NET is decreased in obesity and suggest that the sympathetic innervation of BAT is altered in obesity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636373,N,no phys of interest,,,

Anaerobic threshold determination in cycle ergometer from rating of perceived exertion. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-The objective of the study was to investigate the validity of the rating of perceived exertion threshold (TRPE) for anaerobic threshold (AT) estimation during an incremental test (IT) on a cycle ergometer. Nineteen physically active and healthy men performed an IT on a cycle ergometer. The intensity corresponding to the AT was considered as the point immediately before the abrupt increase in blood lactate concentration ([La]) in the IT. TRPE was determined in the last intensity corresponding to perceptual response previous the 15 arbitrary units (AU) in the 15-point RPE scale. The heart rate (HR), [La], and RPE were obtained at the end of each stage of the IT. There was no significant difference between workload obtained from the AT (150 [120-150] watts) and TRPE (150 [120-150] watts) (p > 0.05). In addition, there were no differences between HR (AT, 139.5 +/- 12.7 b.min vs. TRPE, 141.9 +/- 14.6 b.min, p > 0.05) and [La] (AT, 3.1 [2.8-3.2] mM vs. TRPE, 3.1 [2.9-3.7] mM, p > 0.05). There was a strong correlation between the intensities in AT and TRPE during the IT (r = 0.88). A substantial reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84 [0.64-0.94 confidence interval 95%]) was evidenced, as well as a substantial agreement between the AT and TRPE intensities (Pc = 0.84), as confirmed by the Bland-Altman plot (-4.7 [-34.2/24.7]). TRPE was a predictor of the AT (beta = 1.146, R = 0.770, SEE = 15.070, p < 0.01). It can be concluded that TRPE is valid for AT estimation during an IT on a cycle ergometer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412967,N,no phys of interest,,,

Sleep deprivation is believed to impair the functioning of these control systems, suggesting that it may impede the ability to implement CR effectively. This study tested the causal effects of sleep deprivation on emotional reactivity and the neurobiological systems underlying CR. We employed a within-subject crossover design in which participants underwent fMRI scanning twice, once when fully rested and once after a night of total sleep deprivation. During scans, participants passively viewed or used CR to down-regulate their emotional response to negative and neutral images. Contrary to hypotheses, both self-reported negative affect ratings and neural responses to the images indicated no difference in the way participants implemented CR when sleep deprived and when fully rested. Meanwhile, neural regions that showed distinct reactivity responses to negative relative to neutral images lost this specificity under deprived conditions. Negative affect ratings and heart rate deceleration, a physiological response typically evoked by aversive pictures, exhibited a similar blunting. Together, these results suggest that, although sleep deprivation may reduce the discrimination between emotional reactivity responses to negative and neutral stimuli, it does not impact CR the way it is presently studied.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32163323,N,no phys of interest,,,

Successful positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand imaging of COX-2 in vivo could be a potentially powerful tool for assessing inflammatory response in the brain and periphery. To date, however, the development of PET radioligands for COX-2 has had limited success. METHODS: The novel PET tracer [(11)C]MC1 was used to examine COX-2 expression [1] in the brains of four rhesus macaques at baseline and after injection of the inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the right putamen, and [2] in the joints of two human participants with rheumatoid arthritis and two healthy individuals. In the primate study, two monkeys had one LPS injection, and two monkeys had a second injection 33 and 44 days, respectively, after the first LPS injection. As a comparator, COX-1 expression was measured using [(11)C]PS13. RESULTS: COX-2 binding, expressed as the ratio of specific to nondisplaceable uptake (BPND) of [(11)C]MC1, increased on day 1 post-LPS injection; no such increase in COX-1 expression, measured using [(11)C]PS13, was observed. The day after the second LPS injection, a brain lesion (~ 0.5 cm in diameter) with high COX-2 density and high BPND (1.8) was observed. Postmortem brain analysis at the gene transcript or protein level confirmed in vivo PET results. An incidental finding in an unrelated monkey found a line of COX-2 positivity along an incision in skull muscle, demonstrating that [(11)C]MC1 can localize inflammation peripheral to the brain. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, [(11)C]MC1 successfully imaged upregulated COX-2 in the arthritic hand and shoulder and apparently in the brain. Uptake was blocked by celecoxib, a COX-2 preferential inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that [(11)C]MC1 can image and quantify COX-2 upregulation in both monkey brain after LPS-induced neuroinflammation and in human peripheral tissue with inflammation.

Acute stress alters neural patterns of value representation for others,Neuroimage,"Tomova, L,Saxe, R,Klobl, M,Lanzenberger, R,Lamm, C,eng,Neuroimage. 2020 Apr 1;209:116497. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116497. Epub 2019 Dec 30.","Acute stress is often evoked during social interactions, by feelings of threat or negative evaluation by other people. We also constantly interact with others while under stress - in the workplace or in private alike. However, it is not clear how stress affects social interactions. For one, individuals could become more selfish and focused on their own goals. On the other hand, individuals might also become more focused on affiliating with potential social partners, in order to secure their support. There is, indeed, accumulating behavioral evidence that prosocial behaviors increase rather than decrease under stress. Here, we tested the underlying brain processes of such findings, by assessing the effects of stress on the neural representations of (monetary) value for self and other. Participants (N = 30; male, 18-40 years) played a gambling task for themselves and for another participant while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Each participant played the gambling task twice: once immediately following acute stress induction, and once in a control session. We compared neural patterns of value representation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum using representational similarity analysis (RSA). We found that under stress, dmPFC and striatum showed higher dissimilarity between neural patterns underlying high and low value for the other. Dissimilarity of neural patterns underlying high and low value for the self was unaffected by stress. These findings suggest that participants track the magnitude of possible rewards for others more under stress, suggesting increased prosocial orientation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31899285,N,no phys of interest,,,

Multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and cardiovascular data were gathered from 34 healthy volunteers recruited within the human connectome project (the '100-unrelated subjects' release). Group-wise multi-level fMRI analyses in conjunction with complex instantaneous heartbeat correlates (entropy and Lyapunov exponent) revealed the existence of a specialized brain network, i.e. a complex central autonomic network (CCAN), reflecting what we refer to as complex autonomic control of the heart. Our results reveal CCAN areas comprised the paracingulate and cingulate gyri, temporal gyrus, frontal orbital cortex, planum temporale, temporal fusiform, superior and middle frontal gyri, lateral occipital cortex, angular gyrus, precuneous cortex, frontal pole, intracalcarine and supracalcarine cortices, parahippocampal gyrus and left hippocampus. The CCAN visible at rest does not include the insular cortex, thalamus, putamen, amygdala and right caudate, which are classical CAN regions peculiar to sympatho-vagal control. Our results also suggest that the CCAN is mainly involved in complex vagal control mechanisms, with possible links with emotional processing networks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183642,Y,corr,,,Y

To bridge these theories, we investigated whether the balance between goal-directed and habit networks in patients with OCD was affected during psychological distress. Twenty-three OCD patients and twenty-three healthy controls participated in a controlled stress induction paradigm using the socially evaluated cold-pressor test in a crossover design. Stress responses were evaluated through cortisol levels, blood pressure, and anxiety ratings. Functional connectivity of the caudate nucleus and posterior putamen was assessed using seed region analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, which are hubs of the goal-directed and habit network, respectively. Stress induction increased blood pressure and psychological stress measures across groups and resulted in blunted cortisol responses in patients. Furthermore, patients showed a blunted reduction in connectivity between the caudate nucleus and precuneus during psychological distress, which was positively correlated with compulsivity but not obsession severity. The posterior putamen showed no significant group differences in distress-induced connectivity. These results suggest that compulsivity in OCD is associated with altered connectivity between the goal-directed and default mode networks during psychological distress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094333,N,no corr,,,

Here, we tested how hippocampal-neocortical pattern similarity and connectivity contributed to pain empathy. Using this approach, we analyzed a data set of 102 human participants who underwent functional MRI while painful and non-painful electrical stimulation was delivered to themselves or to a confederate. As hypothesized, results revealed increased pattern similarity between first-hand pain and pain empathy (compared to non-painful control conditions) within the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, the temporo-parietal junction and anterior insula. While representations in these regions were unaffected by confederate similarity, pattern similarity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex was increased the more dissimilar the other individual was perceived. Hippocampal-neocortical connectivity during first-hand pain and pain empathy engaged largely distinct but neighboring primary motor regions, and empathy-related hippocampal coupling with the fusiform gyrus positively scaled with trait measures of perspective taking. These findings suggest that shared representations and mental simulation might contribute to pain empathy via hippocampal-neocortical pattern similarity and connectivity, partially affected by personality traits and the similarity of the observed individual.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32248233,N,no corr,,,

We modelled post-exertional malaise by assessing changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3T during an N-Back working memory task performed prior to a submaximal bicycle stress test and after an identical stress test 24 h later. Serial trends in postural changes in heart rate between supine and standing defined three subgroups of veterans with Gulf War Illness: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (GWI-POTS, 15%, n = 11), Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (GWI-START, 31%, n = 23) and Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception (GWI-STOPP, no postural tachycardia, 54%, n = 46). Before exercise, there were no differences in blood oxygenation level-dependent activity during the N-Back task between control (n = 31), GWI-START, GWI-STOPP and GWI-POTS subgroups. Exercise had no effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent activation in controls. GWI-START had post-exertional deactivation of cerebellar dentate nucleus and vermis regions associated with working memory. GWI-STOPP had significant activation of the anterior supplementary motor area that may be a component of the anterior salience network. There was a trend for deactivation of the vermis in GWI-POTS after exercise. These patterns of cognitive dysfunction were apparent in Gulf War Illness only after the exercise stressor.

The reliability and effectiveness of graph theoretic network metrics as measures of cognitive performance were tested in 37 people with MS and 23 controls. Specifically, relationships with cognitive performance (linear regression against the paced auditory serial addition test-3 seconds [PASAT-3], symbol digit modalities test [SDMT], and attention network test) and 1-month reliability (using the intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) of network metrics were measured using both resting-state functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data. Cognitive impairment was directly related to measures of brain network segregation and inversely related to network integration (prediction of PASAT-3 by small worldness, modularity, characteristic path length, R(2) = 0.55; prediction of SDMT by small worldness, global efficiency, and characteristic path length, R(2) = 0.60). Reliability of the measures for 1 month in a subset of nine participants was mostly rated as good (ICC >0.6) for both controls and MS patients in both functional and diffusion data, but was highly dependent on the chosen parcellation and graph density, with the 0.2-0.5 density range being the most reliable. This suggests that disrupted network organization predicts cognitive impairment in MS and its measurement is reliable for a 1-month period. These new findings support the hypothesis of network disruption as a major determinant of cognitive deficits in MS and the future possibility of the application of derived metrics as surrogate outcomes in trials of therapies for cognitive impairment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32079409,N,clinical,,,

METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized controlled functional brain imaging trial currently being conducted in Sichuan, China. In total, 48 patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma will be recruited randomly and allocated to either of two acupuncture groups: acupuncture at the lung meridian or acupuncture at the heart meridian. The treatment period will last 4 weeks. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire is the primary outcome. The Asthma Control Test, peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and Zung Self-rating Depression Scale will also be used to assess the clinical efficacy of different interventions.
