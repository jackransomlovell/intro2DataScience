# intro2DataScience
This repository consists of materials from an Intro. to Data Science course taught at CU Boulder
each folder consists of a report on a topic of interest I learned about over a two week period,
and then wrote up a report in an .rmd file. The topics range from a simple reinforcement learning
tutorial in R, to developing a shallow CNN for text classification in keras. See the table of contents below.
